### review body ###
<q class="location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__reviewText--gOmRC"><span>These gardens are absolutely incredible. this place is a must see. we visited Singapore for a week and went to the gardens a few times. they are worth the trip. when its day time you can enjoy all the beautiful and rear vegetation and flower and the incredible structures the domes and the supertree groves. at night you will love the amazing light show its spectacular. everything is lit and they do a musical light show twice every evening. we stayed for both show because its just so awesome! you will need a few hours for this so if you can only go once make  sure you go at around 4pm so you'll be able to enjoy the place at day time and see the light show in the evening after the sun goes down.</span></q>

<q class="location-review-review-list-parts-ExpandableReview__reviewText--gOmRC"><span>My college teen and I spent time in both the day and went back at night if you can only see it once, go at night, spectacular. There's a lot to see here, tickets are available on the day of only not in advance. It's was quiet during the day but at night it all comes alive. There are several restaurants and seasonal events, Great place for the anyone to visit.</span></q>
