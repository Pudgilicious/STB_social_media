Because of this, it is really hard to get a closer view of the city since space taken up by these INCONSIDERATE PEOPLE!. There is a restaurant above as well, however only open to hotel guests. The small beverage stand had very little variety of drinks and serves no food. And charges MIND BENDING prices for Tiger Beer (which is a horrible beer i might add). And in case youre wondering....no the pool is not accessible by non-hotel guests.\n",
