I say daytime because others who have visited the place say the nighttime light shows are even better. The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex. The flower dome is billed as the largest greenhouse in the world - large it is indeed, and nicely cool as well, and the geographically themed parts of the dome very nice.

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, “it replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world”. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 15:56:51.105993

It was so crowded there was no space and as seen everywhere in Singapore there was no planning or crowd management. They were giving tickets to any number of people creating a fish market and as per review and research it's the case most of times.

Would suggest to book a table at CAfe la ve, you don't have to take the entry ticket of 32 SGD and can actually eat/drink something for that money.

Also such a waste of paper with printing everyone's pic and trying to sell it with no luck, obviously MBS will throw all the pics which were not sold. Again a very bad practice seen all over singapore.

Otherwise, if you have been to any of Empire State Building, Burj Khalifa, The Shard, etc, this is all a bit underwhelming. And the light show is really not worth hanging around for.",01-2020,,2020-01-17 15:57:10.020969

The lights of Singapore and the Harbour are spectacular, as are the lights from Gardens By The Bay but there appeared to be very little else to this. Perhaps I'm reviewing the wrong thing, but there was no access to the pool pictured or anything other than a viewing platform and a café which was full to bursting. Whilst I enjoyed the view, this isn't something I'd be bothered doing again.",01-2020,,2020-01-17 15:57:10.297621

It was enchanting, and we spent a couple of hours supping Prosecco, surveying the Singapore sights, and talking with like minded visitors. You pay for entry and in return you receive one complimentary drink, that is fair enough, as this deters those who would otherwise do a freebie visit just for the view. It’s a must, when visiting Singapore!",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 15:57:10.573459
