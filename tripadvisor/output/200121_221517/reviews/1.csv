Even in the dark it's an amazing place to visit and there is lighting aplenty. Just stood in awe of the tree structures and gardens.

Along with thousands of other people we walked across to the Marina Bay Sands. Now that is an amazing structure and the place to visit, even if you are not staying there.",07-2019,,2020-01-21 22:15:27.528359

The worlds largest glass greenhouses we later learned. I kept on thinking how did they get these enormous trees into the greenhouses. Another thought that passed through my mind how can they keep these ""bubble"" soooo cold? Yes these greenhouses are cold. Bring a jacket. I also wondering about the inside temperature and the plants well being. Well they seem to be healthy. Anyway it is a must see.",01-2020,,2020-01-21 22:15:27.750412

At night time with the light show everywhere you look is amazing and a real buzz around the gardens.

Great place to take the kids as they really enjoy the different lights and colours that are on show.

Personally I think it‚Äôs best to just stay in the free zone area and not go up to see views they are just ok.

I would make this a top priority to see while in Singapore and If time permits would go in daytime and nighttime to see the difference in atmosphere.",01-2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 22:15:32.541443

The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.

On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don‚Äôt do refunds üôÑ, sorry but that‚Äôs poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck. üò≥
So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....
Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 22:15:32.760338

The path are easy to follow and not overly crowded. There are signs identifying each tree or flower. The wood sculptures are unbelievable. The free light show far surpasses going to the Night Safari. The lights dance to the classical music. Get there early for a seat on the steps. Standing and looking up for close to an hour is not comfortable. Hang back or immediately head for the exits as it is very crowded as the area empties. Access to the park is easy from the Bayfront MRT.,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 22:15:36.779413

There are places to eat by the domes, but the better place is Satay by the Bay which has many hawker stalls and a large variety of food.

Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance.

It's only a short ride from the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal (where you can leave you luggage). The super trees were super. Early in the day there are fewer people so we really enjoyed the Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's surprising how huge the domes really are and they have unique displays.

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 22:15:41.658330

Floral fantasy a little further way from the centre but well worth the hike or shuttle. A small area with floral decorations and interpretations followed by the finale of a 4d film following the path of a dragonfly.....non moving seats on request for those of us with motion sickness

Walking around the clevelry desigined trditonal gardens before going to the tree area was a quiet way to spend some time.

The gardens themselves also needed more signs of where different parts were and it was not clear on booking that the walkway between the trees was only available at certain times.

We went though the domes as fast as we could. The gardens are still amazing, everything is very beautiful.
I recommend not getting tickets with klook in advance because they are for the day you chose and if the weather doesn't allow you to do something, you cannot do the activity some other time or get a refund... The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...
We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.

For me, this visit was enlighting and giving a new perspective that science and technology can make our great nature even more WOW (a.k.a jaw dropping, LOL).
This area is quite huge and perhaps need ""strategy"" so you can use your time wisely and get everything=)
If the weather is good, I suggest you to go around the park first and explore the outdoor area..because the two domes (include the pathways) are totally indoor so no worries with the rain.
All the outdoor area is free to explore..no charge..But for two domes they charge entrance ticket and another charge for observation deck+OCBC skyways.
If you are too tired to walk, the outdoor area can be explored by shuttle car that costs SGD8/1 round trip, but me myself prefered to explore the park on foot. You'll have more time to oberserve and find a lot of photo-shoot spots while walking around. But if you go by shuttle, they provide a recording tape that will give you explanation about the garden. In here, you can see heritage gardens, sun pavilion (cactus) and supertrees while walking around.
After going around the outdoor areas, perhaps you can enter the observation deck and OCBC skyways, because they will close earlier than the domes. But in this visit, I didn't buy the ticket for observation deck & OCBC skyways, so I can't tell you a lot about this..may be next time I'll visit =)
After finished observing the outdoor area, I had lunch first before entering the domes. I would recommend to eat beef & prawn satay at Satay by The Bay. It tastes good, good portion, extra juicy meat and not so expensive. SGD7 for 10 beef satay & SGD2/each prawn satay. The prawn is quite big and juicy. My kids love the prawn very much.. If you don't want to be too full, you can eat with rice cake/""lontong"" (in Malay/Indonesian language) that costs SGD1/small square piece. But if you think you need more carb, maybe better if you just buy rice on other stall and you'll get more by paying the same amount. You can also try water chestnut for the drink, and refreshing tropical fruit for your dessert.
After finished my refreshing lunch, I went to the domes. There are 2 domes, the Flower Domes and the Cloud Forest Dome. I entered the Cloud Forest Dome first...From the first time the entrance door was opened, a huge tall indoor waterfall welcomed me..and it's really a jaw-dropping moment=) I think that is one of the wow-factor of this spot. Perhaps you need to bring jacket, because it's a bit cold inside (even the tap water is cold) and a bit splashy if you take photo near the fall. I was mesmerized by the building structure, how they pump gallons of water all the time to make the man-made waterfall looks alive! and how they use sun panel on the supertree top to make everything works. How smart is the creator of this place!!
This dome is bigger than the Flower Dome..you need to walk on several floors to explore all, but don't worry they have lift too and it is totally accessible for wheel chair and baby stroller. They have waterfall observation deck, the lost world zone (full of mist and you can see carnivore plants), stalagmits collection, orchids, and several unique displays & sculptures from many countries. They even have a lego flowery pond =)
After finished with the Cloud Forest Dome, we went into Flower Dome. There are so many collection of trees and flowers that are arranged to certain theme. The theme will change due to certain period. If the weather is good, you can see the sunset from here too..
The collection of the plants are so many and various and they do alive!! Imagine that many kinds of plants that usually live in different types of habitat can live in one same place.. They put complete explanation on a board in front of every plants. There are several sculpture from stem and roots and they were amazing artwork.
In my visit on January, they were in changing process from Christmas theme to Dahlia (Chinese New Year) theme..The Dahlia will be fully displayed on Jan 17 (if I'm not mistaken). But the existing flower arrangement is still even great for me=) We took several photos in front of the themed garden before leaving this dome.
Then here comes the dinner time.. I chose to eat at Pollen. I recommend you to eat here because it's very near to Supertree..so in case you bring children like me..you know, they eat so slow =) so, if they can't finished their meal before the Supertree Light Show, you can watch while you eat =) There are several restaurants that you can pick here, such as Vietnamese Pho, Japanese, Singaporean chicken/pork rice, Texas fried chicken..at that time I tried the Japanese food and it's so yummy...SGD10-12 for one menu. The portion is quite big, I can not finished myself =) If you want complete menu just add few dollars and you'll have miso soup, 2 slices of watermelon and salad. Bring your tumbler and tap water is free all over the park if you want to save money =)
Then here it is..the closing for this day..the light show...it started on 7.45 p.m and last for around 15min. It great to see the light on supertrees flipping following the music and it's a good photo-shoot spot too with the lighted supertrees behind you..=) you can see the lighted singapore flyer and marina bay sands too from here. In case you missed the show, you can wait for the next show on 8.45 p.m.

Flower Dome: Was decorated in all its Christmas glory.
Christmas Nordic Gnome Themed scenarios everywhere.
Everyone was oohing & aahing as they walked around

Cloud Forest Dome: the minute you walk in and see the waterfall in all its glory.
There are different levels in this dome with different experiences and views of the dome's floral and fauna species
There are great garden sculptures and phenomenal driftwood carved sculptures.
This dome is worth experiencing!

The Super Grove Light Show:
Get there early and claim a place to sit
Many people lay on the concrete beneath the tree structures waiting for the light show
The light show is approx 15 mins long. The lights and lasers are in sync with the music
It was an awesome show and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.....Don't miss it!

Christmas Wonderland it wasn‚Äôt.,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.

We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn‚Äôt an option for us.

It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn‚Äôt have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.

At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??

We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn‚Äôt an option.

Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly‚Äôs promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.

After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.

Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.

All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:17:49.311383

This man-made master piece lives up to the the hype and offers a beautiful experience worth the lifetime.

The Musical Light Show is spectacular and if you fail to get a ticket (limited tickets makes it impossible to accommodate everyone so please book it way in advance) to observe it from the viewing deck

The light show takes place twice every night and is on for 15 minutes. The first show is on at 7:45pm and the second is on at 8:45pm. An extra show on Holidays is added, for which you'll have check on their official website (usually a 9.45pm show) .

There are many spots to see this beauty but our favorite (and Highly recommended) was to lie down on the concrete circles supporting the Garden Towers called Super tree Groves an hour prior to the show as they fill-in fast.

Others being:

From above, on the skywalk of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, decent view minus the music

On the promenade by the Dragonfly Lake, at the park entrance between Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

The Deck / Skywalk exactly above the public loo overlooking the Super tree Groves (have some steps to climb up)

Other than that there are observatories like Cloud Forest, Flower Forest Dome which are worth the dime.

Numerous sculptures and and arts installed in beautiful corners are worth enjoying.

Restaurants are plenty but standards aren't that great so would suggest to stick to McDs in the Garden.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 22:18:02.342570

I'd definitely say it's worth it and you should go. This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.
The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.
I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out.

PROS:
- Loved the waterfall and carnivorous plants
- Skywalk experience was nice and gave a better feel of the olace
- Good place to spend time wiyh family, specially the light show in evening
- Food is awesome in the food court on the other side of bridge (unable to recall the name but you will find sign boards for guidance)

CONS:
- Christmas carnival was not at all attractive and needs separate ticket.
- Light show must have been special till few years back but now its a common thing around the world, have seen similar stuff in Akshardham in New Delhi India
- The whole experience seemed to be a bit stretched over the day, specially covering everything during day and then waiting for lights to comeon at night
- OCBC Skywalk is mostly non operational in December due to climate issues. They are very cautious and dont allow operations even if there is only a chance of a rain. The online ticket that i purchased was non refundable had they not allowed a delayed entry after arguing for one hour anf waiting for 2.5 hours",12-2019,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 22:18:54.760411

The lightshow as ok, nothing to shout about but perhaps we missed the full experience not being closer and not being able to hear the music.

We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.

Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".

So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change. The MRT counter initially didn't want to assist in breaking up our $10 note, which would have left us stranded.

We visited both the flower room and the cloud forest and were amazed at the level of care, information and sheer wonder on display there. We also went on the 4d motion ride, which was surprisingly a great little diversion.
Now, with it being one of the main sites to see in Singapore, the Gardens always seem to be busy with a capital ‚ÄòB‚Äô.

But the star of the show are The Super trees ... they are FAB -U-LOUS!
We did the sky walk also which is worth doing as you walk up around top of trees on a platform.

Alice and the crew are just one of several themes. Singapore has done an amazing creative job of bringing a variety of examples of floral ecosystems from around the world all housed under an architectural master piece.

The Flower Gardens is huge! One could spend hours exploring and losing yourself in the organic fantasy sculptures. During the Christmas/New Year holiday season there‚Äôs an entire display dedicated to a secular celebration bathed in lights that will leave no doubts about the beauty and magic of the time of year.

Singapore has a reputation for being hot and humid but that‚Äôs not the case in the climate controlled air conditioning inside the Gardens building, a plus for those of us who are impacted by heat related medical issues.

There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro.

Then you can stroll to Satay by the Bay to have some satay. It can be really crowded on weekends and public holidays. Then walk to Supertree Grove to watch the night lighting show (please check the time). The show lasts for 15 minutes. If you watch the last show at 8:30pm, please take note that it is very challenging to catch a cab when the show ends. For express taxi in order to avoid queue, you will be charged $30 to Marina Bay Sands, and other destinations $50 which is ridiculous.

Cloud Forest & Flower Dome:
If you buy tickets for this combo, you‚Äôll able to enjoy it for the whole day. You could also do re entry for both venues. Just make sure to get the re entry stamp at the exit. You‚Äôll spend 45mins to 1 hour minimum at each dome. Remember you can come back to visit these domes for the whole day.

Super Grove Trees:
You will need to get the tickets separately from the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. You‚Äôll spend 45-1 hour here depending on how long you plan your visit. If you‚Äôre shooting a pro photo, it may be longer.

Flora Fantasy:
This is a separate exhibition and no re-entry is allowed. There‚Äôs a 4D Show before you exit. You will spend approximately 45 mins to 1 hour here.

Team Lab showcase:
This is showing currently till March 2020. You will need to ride on the shuttle to get here. You can purchase at the ticket counter for 3 dollars per person. Get a stamp as you are able to ride the shuttle for the whole day.

Tips:
Go early morning so you can enjoy the venues at slow pace without many people.

Go on weekdays if possible. Weekends are usually very crowded. In general, this place is very popular.

Grab Car or take a cab if you can. No need to struggle to get a parking if you‚Äôre driving in the island. This place can be quite competitive to score a parking at peak hour.

If you‚Äôve re entry stamps for Cloud Forest & Flower Dome - you can come back in the evening. You will be able to enjoy TeamLab eggs lights and also the music show at Super Grove Trees.

It has two paid parks Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Former is a manmade representation of how forest in Amazon grows, beautiful, falls, mists and walkway created to give you a feel of what it could be.

Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.

Besides there's a OCBC skyway, good for a one time visit but reach before sunset if you want to have nice photos. However the associated laser show towards end of day ( 2 timings) is really interesting.

There's a lot of free area associated with Gardens by the bay which is a very nice 2 hours walk to the Gardens and a good day visit to locals. If you are visiting Singapore for a short time, it can be completely skipped.",01-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:19:38.164322

Bought separate ticket to the new Supertree observation deck on the first day it was open. don‚Äôt forget to go to the rooftop! Best views in Singapore because you can see the sky deck and super trees, Ferris Wheel and harbour. You don‚Äôt need to do the other Supertree walking path as the views are similar but not as high.

Good selection for lunch at the food hall including gluten free options at the Vietnamese.
We walked back over through marina bay sands and filled in the rest of the afternoon walking around marina bay. A big walking day but a great way to see the area.

The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee.

My suggestion is to visit there by late afternoon, so that you can finish it after the sunset, during which it is more admirable due to the spectacular lighting decorations.
We were little disappointed in the Flower Dome as apart from few varieties of flowers, rest everything was just green and green and lots of varieties of cactus. Nevertheless it was still good to see all that.
Cloud forest is one thing you can‚Äôt miss. Beautifully made and with a tall man made water fall.
Later in the evening, you can visit the tree groves and if u like can have a walk on the sky bridges which connects the tree groves (OCBC Skywalk).
Ince you finish there, just walk over to the other side towards the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Have a stroll and shop if you like and enjoy the Fountain Show on the river side of the Marina Bay. Two shows daily at 8:00 pm and then 9:00 pm

The gardens do allow free access to certain parts, but you have to may for the cloud forest, flower dome and floral fantasy. Shuttle service and OCBC walk also requires payment.

We walked by the Dragonfly Lake and then crossed the Dragonfly Bridge into the Supertree Grove.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world.

There are a number of other attractions within the Gardens, such as the Silver forest, Golden garden and the Large Floral Clock.

The flower dome was set up for Christmas with an amazing display and also fully air conditioned which was great given the humidity of outside. The displays were varied and well set out with character hidden through out each section.
Cloud dome how refreshing and cool that was the force of the water fall was surprising and amazing, the walk through was well set out going through each section before heading up to the top of the waterfall there was a short wait which we were well informed about before we even entered the dome they said 30 minutes but it was really only 15. The high walk down the water fall was slightly congested at some points that was more to people suddenly stopping to take photos.
We did the sky walk at night after the first light show, though I hate heights it was a view not to be missed, they limit the numbers on it and you have between 15-30 minutes to complete the walk giving you plenty of time to snap some amazing photos.

‚Ä¶..which you can do seeing admission is free and there‚Äôs a lot to see without having to spend extra.
Of course you can spend extra once inside - on entry to the CLOUD FOREST or the OCBC SKYWAY, not to mention riding the shuttle across the gardens. Of these, we did the last immediately on mainly entry to orientate ourselves to the layout ‚Äì once aware, it was a relatively short and very scenic walk back via SUPERTREE GROVE to the entry near BAYFRONT MRT.
We gave the SKYWAY a miss on account a nearby rumbling electrical storm had entry temporarily suspended and time constraints forced us to miss the CLOUD FOREST. Next time.
Speaking of time ‚Äì if you decided to take in everything on offer I reckon you could spend most of the day here ‚Äì and certainly fill a full morning or afternoon. Our truncated but very satisfying dash thru the place took up abt 2 hours.

PRACTICALITIES ‚Äì no shortage of shaded seating, rest rooms and refreshment outlets.
- the entry to the GARDENS is well signposted from within BAYFRONT MRT ‚Äì you have abt a 300m walk from the platforms.

Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.

Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly.

Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful and totally unique attraction and the two conservatories are (in my view) the standouts. The Cloud Forest replicates the rainforest conditions found in tropical mountain regions and has a huge 35m man made waterfall which you can get to the top of via elevator and slowly descend down via an elevated walkway. It‚Äôs stunningly beautiful with some beautiful plant life on display including different types of ferns and orchids.

The Flower Dome is actually the largest conservatory in the world and houses plant life from Mediterranean and semi-arid regions (there are some excellent cacti and succulent plants on display). It is larger than Cloud Dome but does not have multiple levels and a sky walk like the Cloud Dome.

Both conservatories are cooled and eco-friendly with rainwater collected and circulated throughout.

Tip - you can buy individual tickets to each dome separately for the same price. The Cloud Forest Dome has a lot more to see and do than the Flower Dome in my opinion (including 2 excellent short films on climate change in the Cloud Dome Theatre) so if you are pressed for time I would choose Cloud Forest. Tickets are also cheaper if you book online the day before (save $5).

This was my second trip to GBTB and it was great to be back. There are some other attractions such as OCBC Skyway and Floral Fantasy that you can check out (both require tickets) or you can stroll through the outdoor section with the towering Supertree Grove ‚Äútrees‚Äù which light up at night - this is free to enter.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 22:24:10.279500

The gardens are peaceful and hold a lot of interesting artful sculptures and plants.
There's a small train which doesn't charge much that will take you to the domes.
The gardens themselves are even more magnificent in the dark when the neon gardens light up.
As for the domes.
The Flower Dome had a large array of beautiful rhododendrons each flower prettier than the first, (we had missed the orchids flowing season) it also had gardens based on countries, and we were amused when a tour guide explained that the maleleuca was used to make maleleuca honey. We didn't correct him.
The Cloud Dome was even better. It has a waterfall inside. Walking along a path, when you reach the top of the dome it makes you feel like you are walking in the clouds using a specialised misting machine. The effect also assists in watering the mountain off plants that grow up the man made mountain inside the dome.
If you look hard you will see several sculptures that look like they've been made from driftwood and a lion carved from a tree.

Review focuses on the Skyway & Supertree Grove

The Gardens by the Bay is Singapore at its best. The gardens come in three parts: Bay South, Bay East & Bay Central, of which Bay South is the largest (54 ha) and attracts the majority visitors ‚Äì for most, this is the park. It registered the 50th million visitor in 2018 just six years after opening. The park skirts Marina Bay on land reclaimed from the sea and exemplifies the vision of the government of the day for the development of a ‚Äòcity in a garden‚Äô ‚Äì raising the quality of urban life by emphasizing the aesthetic values that comes from access to and/or living in green space.
Walk around the park ‚Ä¶ slowly ‚Ä¶ and the visual elegance of the place comes across immediately. But there‚Äôs more beneath the galaxy of different green/floral gardens within the park - the sophistication of the conservatories (i.e. Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), fun for kids of all ages in the water-play garden and the Supertree Grove - there are the environmental messages/systems that simulate the reality of photosynthesis, water harvesting, energy capture, heat disposal and more. This is a playground with features that entertain and inform ‚Äì what you don‚Äôt see (unless you look for it) are layers beneath layers that underlie the complexity of the bioengineering required to support, nurture and sustain the botanical heritage that has been established.
Sit at a table outside the Supertree Food Hall facing the Supertree Grove (with the iconic Marine Sands Bay Building behind) and there‚Äôs this vista of green exuberance. The Supertrees are not real trees ‚Äì but tree-like structures 25-50 m high - that resemble trees in form and symmetry, and vegetation that has been established/grown to cover the underlying structure. In fact, the ‚Äòtrees‚Äô have a reinforced concrete core with external steel frame to which are attached planting panels ‚Äì that form the basis of vertical gardens. Of course you can see it‚Äôs not a real tree, but it feels like one when up close and, more so, when seen from a distance and/or when exploring the aerial walkway halfway up the trees.
It was a Sunday, and we‚Äôd taken the MRT to Marina South Pier (end of the line terminus station) that morning to explore the Singapore Maritime Gallery and, couple hours later, figured to walk through the Gardens by the Bay; the distances are comfortable on foot ‚Äì once you‚Äôre in the park ‚Äì the main challenge. We were not certain about crossing the Marina Coastal Expressway that skirts this part of the island and tends to cut the beach off from the hinterland. People whom we asked did not seem familiar with the ‚Äòwalking‚Äô aspect (and tended to discourage it ‚Äì ‚Äòtake a taxi‚Äô etc. crept into the discussion).
Well, by chance there was a 14-seater courtesy bus that ran the route on the half-hour ‚Äì nice touch; we had the bus to ourselves with a courteous driver who dropped us off just inside the park. What could have been more convenient - thanks to the friendly man at the Information Desk at Marina South Pier.
We‚Äôve been to the Gardens a number of times over the years ‚Äì always a good half-day wandering and exploring; always new things to see. Finding a convenient lunchtime coffee/snack opportunity, however, was a key priority. Lots of signposts/maps around and there‚Äôs no issue with finding your way. We crossed the Meadow heading into the centre of the park, skirted the Supertree Grove and then into the Food Hall, and out again (too noisy). Immediately outside was the caf√© that we were seeking. First impressions? Light, spacious, dominated by high pillars holding up the concrete road/footpath above, views into the Supertree Grove and, crucially, empty tables/seats ‚Äì great.
We had not originally intended to explore the OCBC Skyway, but it was there just a few metres away. Why not! Snack finished we headed off across the grove to catch the elevator that would take us up 22 m to the walkway that loops around three of the supertrees - to hang out over the edge and take time to explore the park, buildings and distant open water by eye.
Surprisingly there were relatively few people there. The kiosk is directly opposite the elevator (inside the ‚Äòtrunk‚Äô of the nearest Supertree). We paid S$8/each for our tickets and, five minutes later, we had the walkway largely to ourselves. Lots of deck space at either end of the walkway where you gain access and then, one circuit 128 m later, where you return to the ground.
In between there‚Äôs this ‚Äòin-the-sky‚Äô feel about things given the uncluttered design of the walkway, chest-high open/netted sides topped by a handrail over which you can lean, width that varies between 1.5-3 m and oval/semi-circular curve that continues to point you in a different direction as you walk. No, there‚Äôs no issue with ‚Äòheight, exposure, apprehension, etc.‚Äô you can‚Äôt for example, see through the deck beneath your feet.
That said, leaning over the rail we lost a hat to the wind - watched it float down into a flower garden at the base of one of the Supertrees ‚Äì good no one would see it there; they didn‚Äôt and 20 minutes later we rescued it.
In the distance you can see across Marina Bay towards the Bay East Gardens and, further towards the sea, there‚Äôs the Marina Barrage (where you can cross over to the other gardens). We were heading that way to visit the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (opened June 2018) and explore the development of water resources in the island.
Key/final point ‚Äì there‚Äôs no entry fee into the park ‚Äì gardens, lakes, children‚Äôs play area too; you pay for entry into the specialized features ‚Äì conservatories, aerial walkway.

They show you a documentary about climate change in the Cloud Forest, which makes you think about your own contribution to save the planet (great!) and at the same time you find a Mc Donald's (?!) in the middle of the park, a gift shop full of stuff wrapped in plastic with loads of unnecessary souvenirs and the Flower Dome is filled with christmas decorations out of plastic (artificial snow in between the flowers). It's ironic, sad, stupid and so much else... Who worked on this concept? In the end it's only about profit, entertainment and fullfilling the visitors needs to shop and make pictures. Would be so great, if they'd have taken their own concept serious and would support local businesses f.e. - keep their carbon footprint in mind. See for yourself.

This is one of the best man made horticulture places and it contains two big glass domes, one for Green vegetation and another one for flowers. Both are beautifully designed magnificently and is covering huge landscapes. The time taken to visit these two is one hour each.
Each has entrance ticket to be purcahsed. Cloud Forest.

The first one that we saw was cloud forest. At the entrance, you are greeted with a huge man made waterfall which was very beautiful. The on the stretch you could see many trees grown in a thick forest like view and there is an elevator and escalator to its 17th floor. Here, we could take a breathtaking view of the horticulture grown inside the glass dome. You could alight down a spiral road which on the way gives luxurious sceneries.

Flower dome.

Next comes the flower dome. Here the same glass dome is prevalent but this time with more natural flowers that give colour to our life. Many unknown colourful flowers greet all the way and you will definitely get tired taking photos and selfies all along. There is another area where there is a floral fantasy world setup. You could enjoy the variety of flowers decorated all along. At the end there is a small 4d show, which has swinging seats according to the motion you see on the short movie.

Don't ever miss these two attractions.

On the southern bay, there is huge tree like iron structures called super trees which is due worsted with lighting. There is a light show, every day between 7:45 to 8:45 pm and this was really wonderful to see.

Other than these there are shops as usual which depicts the beauty. One thing I would like to mention here is the practice of taking group photos by the professionals, per family and if you are interested to have them, you have to pay and these photos are mounted on a frame with beautiful backgrounds to cherish your memory later.",11-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:25:42.030686

The Flower Dome was impressive in size - a bit difficult to navigate due to the size but spend time wandering around. The Christmas decorations were out while we were there which was fun to see. They had some really cute decorations.

The skywalk was a great view - doesn't take too long to go across but can still get some great views of the supertree grove.

There are several other gardens around worth exploring that are free to enter.

I bought a deal on Klook that provided a Singapore river cruise, cloud garden, flower dome, and the skywalk for a discounted price. I would recommend trying to find this deal if you plan on going. It was very easy to exchange for tickets (show them on your phone at the Red Dot Museum).

Follow by the dinner before going to the light show and skywalk. Please check the light show schedule before you go.

The flower Dome was an amazing sight of colour, flowers and plants around the world- a delight to see. The domes themselves are engineered in a way that is not hindered by support piers to intrude on the visual impact of such beauty!
The second dome ‚Äò
The ‚ÄòCloud Forest‚Äô is just that a rainforest in a dome that boosts an amazing waterfall and winding path that meanders up alongside the waterfall. The waterfall surrounded by many tropical plants, way too much to do justice to the gardens.
It would be amazing to see the Gardens by the Bay at night. Indeed a speculative show. A must do for our next visit.
The Domes are air conditioned and very comfortable to spend time in. Though the gardens are free the Domes have a cost.
A train ride and commentary will assist in orienting visitors around the gardens surrounding the domes. A small cost for train is involved. If walking signs are clear and workers happy to advise.
Sculptures in the gardens are interesting and are well placed in the garden areas. A must see is the large sculpture by Marc Quinn known as the floating baby and that‚Äôs just how it looks!

We gave up and returned on Monday morning, what a difference. Plenty of space to admire the gardens and the views. The Cloud Forest takes you to a rain forest with an amazing high waterfall.

Locals even come to this place to jog. You can do lots of bird photography in the outdoor gardens too.

Should have gone hours before because there is so much to see such as Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and more as well as the Supertree Grove.
The Ticket Options I found were somewhat confusing at least by the lady I spoke to at the Ticket Office. What was particularly annoying was not being able to buy a package which included the OCBC Skywalk. For that you had to go to the Supertree Grove and find the separate Booking Office as you were advised what time the next walk was available. After booking your time you then had to join the queue and wait in my case close to an hour before my time allotted became available. I simply ran out of time before the Grove closed as I didn't want to spend my time standing in a line.
Wandered around for about 20 minutes gazing at the magnificent sight of the illuminated 'trees'. I noticed a lot of people starting to lie down in various places even on the walkway not realizing that there was an evening audio/visual display about to start (hadn't seen any signs advertising it anywhere even at the entrance). Decided to join all the people and lie down gazing up at the illuminated 'trees' and to my delight the audio/visual started at about 7:45 PM after only lying there for a minute or two.
Advice: Go for perhaps 3-4 hours and see as much as you can without it becoming just a blur. Certainly Cloud Forest and Flower Dome look interesting. See if you can get onto the OCBC Skywalk in time for the audio/visual. At least make sure you are there at night for everything to be lit up.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:28:53.263051

Tip: One need not go up on the OCBC skyway to see the show (which anyway is tricky due to the 'timing') - honestly think the best view is from the ground!

TRAVELLERS TIP: The plants at Cloud Forest get ‚Äúwatered‚Äù through a misting system which comes at 2-hour intervals from 10 am. You may wish to visit in the evening for the best effect, as the mist will linger for a while longer in the evening when it is cooler. The water misters give the Cloud Forest more of a mystical look - it was best described in an article I read as ""a scene from Jurassic Park"".

HELPFUL INFO: The outdoor gardens - free admission (Supertree Grove, Sun Pavillion, Heritage Gardens, World of Plants and Dragonfly & Kingfisher Lakes) are open from 5 am-2 pm. The Cooled Conservatories - $28 (for two conservatories) with the peak times being from 4 pm-7 pm.

After 2 hours I had barely touched the surface of the Gardens. Surprisingly to me, a large part of the Gardens is free to view, this including the Supertrees, which are amazing in themselves, especially during the evening light and sound show. This was truely special and not to be missed.

You do pay to enter the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. That was SGD28, which I consider money well spent as I spent probably 3 hours there in total. Times that by 2, as I went again the next day as I enjoyed it so much.

The grounds are huge and many beautiful things to see. Other than hunger preventing me, I would have spent at least an hour or two more there looking around.

I recommend you go after lunch to see everything and wait until the Supertrees light show. Otherwise, go twice like I did.",10-2019,,2020-01-21 22:30:34.634310

It is well laid out, and you can take an electric buggy ride through the gardens. There are also 2 large cooled covered enclosures, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, besides the OCBC (walking) Skyway, all 3 with ticketed entry. There is also a free open air ""Sound and Light Show"" at nights. I have seen 2 special shows in the Flower Dome, the Tulips Show and the Cherry Blossom Show, which were exquisite and most colourful.

If you are a first timer like me then I would advice that you purchase the bundle package which includes Flower Doom, Cloud Forest and shuttle ride from main entrance to the two Dooms. The walk is long and the weather is hot during the day, so I would strongly recommend it. The bundle package only can be purchase at the ticket booth.

We went to the Floral Fantasy first, which is very romantic & beautiful. Especially, we loved & enjoyed the ride at the end very much.

The Flower Doom & Cloud Forest are nice too. I was amazed by the varieties of flowers & trees that they have in the doom.

We didn't get to do the supertree's skywalk because we thought it would be better to do it around the dawn instead of morning. We were planning to go back around 5pm.
However we have encountered some incidents that our schedule got delayed by couple hrs. We went back close around 8pm and the ticket was sold out, so we weren't able to go up there.

Overall, we had great time. We ended up spending more time than we originally anticipated. I would recommend place if you like flowers and plants.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 22:30:48.108382

If you start the visit during the day, note that the sun is so strong and as the park is very big you need to have comfortable shoes.

While I agree with recommendations to go late afternoon to catch the light show when it gets dark (7:45 pm for 1st show), make sure you provide enough daylight time if you wish to go to the two main gardens. We ended up in the floral garden and it was too dark to appreciate it as they keep the lighting quite dim. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded. It was designed to push the crowds through so it wasn't a long wait but it distracts from the nature appreciation aspects.

The most disconcerting part are the massive bottlenecks along two narrow staircase on the path to get back to the Bayside MRT Station when everyone leaves after the light show. While the crowd during my visit was relatively well disciplined, it is a disaster waiting to happen if anything unusual occurs. The massive sway in the pedestrian bridge with a huge crowd was not the most pleasant. I am surprised these were not taken into account in the design.",10-2019,,2020-01-21 22:30:57.593766

We took the Audio tour on a buggy through the gardens and this explained all of the areas, different gardens and sculptures. This is a great way to see and hear about the gardens especially as it can be so hot and walking the gardens can take a few hours. To do all of the gardens you really need most of the the day.

The Floral Fantasy does have some very exotic and interesting flowers/plants as does the Flower Dome but it‚Äôs not really worth the entrance fee.

The Cloud Forest was unfortunately closed for maintenance, we didn‚Äôt get a chance to walk around the public gardens as it was dark when the light show finished.

The light show which is formed around and onto the Super trees is a great spectacle and was by far the best thing we saw and it‚Äôs free, the show starts at 19.45 each evening and lasts for 15 minutes.

I arrived and wanted a quick tour before walking around.
There is a bus ride you can get for around 7SPD or around this price I can‚Äôt remember exactly. This was great- English speaking tour guide pointing out all of the different sections and then ending by the cloud forest so you can buy a ticket and go inside.
There is a dual ticket for all the domes which are all worth the price.
The floral fantasy is on the other side of the park, you can get a bus over or it‚Äôs about a 10 min walk from the other domes.
You can walk around the park with no charge and do not have to pay if you don‚Äôt go into the domes / skywalk etc.
You have to pay around 7/8SPD to walk on the super tree grove skywalk, this is done in time slots and can get a bit busy but the lines move quickly. If weather is stormy they will temporarily close the walk for safety- but you can simply wait for it to clear and get a later time slot. This is what I did, I just went and had some lunch while waiting.
The food there is great there are lots of choices inside the food hall right opposite the super tree grove.

The light shows in the evening are well worth the wait ! Absolutely incredible to see, get a spot early as the lawn fills up with everyone sitting down and waiting for it to start.
Times of the shows are 7.45pm / 8.45pm last around 15 mins.

Some lovely things in the gift shops.

After the light shows it gets very busy with everyone trying to leave and get taxis
Either leave a bit early or wait for the lines to clear up. I managed to book a grab taxi instead of waiting in the line for a taxi which was about a 30 min wait.",08-2019,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 22:32:23.322177

It was just a waste of time and money! There is nothing special about the attraction. It over price and similar plantation can be found in other gardens around the world.

There's a 3rd, but we only wanted to do 2 of them and was told that if we only picked 2, it was these 2 that we could only do (I assume because the 3rd dome was further out). You can pick all 3 in a package which comes with a free ride on the golf buggy.
We got there nice and early on a Monday and had breakfast there, before starting out. We did Cloud Forest first and found the dome nice and quiet - only a handful of other visitors. The place is so big, you don't really get in each other's way anyway. Bear in mind that the domes are climate controlled and it was very cool in both of them. The Cloud Forest begins with a misty waterfall, before you walk around and head up to the overhead walkway. The views around the gardens and outside through the dome windows were really cool. With the 2 kids, it took us about 40 minutes to complete the dome.
Flower dome is located next to Cloud forest and when we entered about 10.30, it was very busy. The dome is broken up into different regions of the world and is very colourful, but I didn't find it as fun as I'm not a green thumb. There were plenty of colourful photo opportunities, but as it was very busy, it was a case of waiting for your turn, or waiting for the crowd to stop walking through.
The park and the domes are very wheelchair and pram friendly - we didn't have a stroller, but noticed all the ramp and elevator options.
Once we were done, we left by walking to the MRT station. It takes about 10 minutes (adult walk) and you get to walk through those gigantic trees you can see from afar.

Garden by the bay is such a wonderful place for young kids to learn and play. My 3 years old like to go there every week. Either happy hours at the water park, or appreciate the exhibition in the Dome, or just walk along the river. You can spot monitor lizard near the river.
We also likes satay by the bay which offers good food at reasonable price.

The shortfalls are Forest is not so convenient for families bringing stroller. So we usually only visit the Dome, though they are side by side.
Also there is a small water playground in between satay by the bay and marina barrage, which is great for small kids to have fun.

I suggest to be prepared to stay longer than 3 hours especially when it's crowded and if you want to take breaks, sit down in the garden, wander around. 2-3 hours to visit the domes and skywalk.

If you have a hard time walking like I did, then buy the pass that includes the shuttle (airport cart type of transit) since it's a bit of a walk to get from entrance points to the domes.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:33:13.269798

The gardens are open to all visitors with no fee, and then inside the gardens you have couple of places where you can enter purchasing a ticket. The open area includes sort of a theme gardens (Chinese garden, Colonial garden, etc) and the famous flower statues. There are also caffees and places to eat, and few spots perfect for the kids to play. When it comes to areas where you need to pay to access - there are two domes, one is the cloud forest with large waterfall coming from the top of the building and inside you have different gardens/exhibitions on each floor, so you take the elevator up and as you go down you stop on each floor to see something different. The other dome is gardens of the world, so vegetation, trees and plants from all around the world (Australian garden, Mediterranean garden, etc). There is also a flower garden which we didn't manage to see.
I'm pretty sure there is also a fee to go to the top of the flower statues and walk on the bridges from one to another - we did not do it since the line was horrifying, we would need to spend at least 45 min in line to enter.
Overall I enjoyed the Gardens, I think it's a place where you can easily spend all day. In my opinion it's something that families with kids would enjoy more, nonetheless it's a interesting and fun place for grownups as well.",09-2019,,2020-01-21 22:33:57.983279

As a result, we finished ‚Äúviewing‚Äù in about 30 minutes. Exiting was an issue as we could not see the sign and ended up joining the queue to the Cloud Dome. When the usher was asked, she gave the wrong instructions not meant for a wheelchair and we ended up in the souvenir shop again, looking for an exit.

For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around.

Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area previously was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time in Singapore. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture.

So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions. But, if you want to see what Singapore is truly all about, you may have to go to other locations.",09-2019,,2020-01-21 22:35:02.416862

I think the term Gardens by the Bay refers to the gardens and the tree structures but may also include the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, each housed in their own separate very large Greenhouse - I have reviewed these separately. The tree structures are very impressive in the style of something from Avatar the movie. They are much more impressive at night when they are lit up and there is a twice nightly light show set to music. It's a surreal and futuristic experience. There is a walkway between the two 'supertrees' for which there is a small charge. We found it difficult to plan ahead to do the walkway because we were given contradictory information by ticket staff which meant we made two fruitless attempts to get tickets for a specified time. Best advice is just to turn up when you want to do the walkway and wait your turn.

As a real nature lover I am very selective and critical about places that are people-made but I love the way Singapore has a way of combining man-made structures with nature. They know how to combine the beauty of nature and it is so important on an island that is virtually a city to make space for nature where one can enjoy the beauty while having the comforts and conveniences of modern technology. It is a must-see for anyone visiting Singapore. Prepare to spend the entire day here and wear good walking shoes, as there is a lot to see, with both the cloud forest and the floral gardens, where it is nice and cool.

I booked a ticket for an Audio Tour, a 20-minute tram ride around the outdoors accompanied by informative audio commentary for a full cruising around. The next step is to enjoy the Flower Dome + Cloud Forest with FREE timing. The Supertrees are the first things you will notice when approaching the Gardens. Unfortunately, the OCBC Skyway was closed for maintenance. The Flower Dome was less than what I expected, I could say that the Green Planet in Dubai is far more exciting to see (although smaller) and many comments say that the Botanical gardens of Singapore are more beautiful (I will visit this week). I seem to enjoy the Cloud Forest more; I loved the waterfall, the cooling atmosphere, and being on top of the mountain. You will find SentSational Orchids (event) until 22 September in Cloud Forest, It is a small area though. I will visit the latest attraction at the gardens, Floral Fantasy this week.

Access to the outside gardens is free but it is well worth paying the entry charges for the Flowerdome and Rainforest. A trip to the top of the Rainforest with its tumbling waterfall is quite unique and breathtaking.

Which city has the luxury of having so much nature in the heart of the city .

The fact that here is a beautiful flora and fauna haven you can visit at anytime of the day since it is completely air conditioned and perfect to save yourself from the hot climate of Singapore , is the 1st reason to visit . The flower dome is a delightful display of seasonal flowers all arranged perfectly for those Instagram shots and simply wonderful to be surrounded by so much colour . All year round it‚Äôs a treat to the eyes to see floral displays of orchids, roses , Sakura , dahlias and many more .
While cloud forest is truly what it‚Äôs name suggests . A feeling of walking in the clouds with a rainforest display of varied fauna and a huge waterfalls . There is something so refreshing and peaceful about the cloud forest that makes you forget the outside world .
Try to get to these places early , as you will encounter large groups of tourists late morning . But it is also magical in the late hours around 7 pm . The conservatories close by 9 pm so make sure you dedicate at least 1/2 hr to each .
Other paid attractions are the OCBC skywalk and the newest one , floral fantasy , worth visiting if you have the time.

Besides the attractive grounds and the massive metal trees that are the emblem of the Gardens, there are 3 enclosures to visit. The Floral Fantasy is new and contains a concentrated mass of flowers and a multi-dimensional theatrette at the exit. This 5 minute film of the Gardens takes you on a 3D flight around all the attractions with seats that sway with the movement and the occasional spray of scent to mimic the flowers. It‚Äôs very well done. The Cloud Forest has a massive inside waterfall and an elevator that takes you to the top before spiralling on a walk back down. The Flower Dome unsurprisingly is full of blooming colourful flowers.
While you can ‚Äúdine‚Äù on McDonalds nearby, make the effort to find Satay on the Bay nestled in a corner of the park. This is genuine street food, though slightly more expensive than your average food stall. But the options are many and the food fresh and delicious. I purchased 30, yes 30, mixed satay sticks on a platter supposedly for sharing. I got to 21. Yum. You can try stingray here if you wish plus lots of other more regular delights.
We spent some time over in the Marina Bay shops, definitely looking only ‚Äì Singapore isn‚Äôt cheap anymore and these arcades are lined with every boutique brand imaginable.
Finally we returned after dark for the night light shows ‚Äì one a water fountain presentation on the city side of the Marina Bay Sands at 8pm and one in the Gardens at 8.45, where all the big trees ‚Äúdance‚Äù to the music with multi-coloured displays. There is a skyway walk that circles between 2 of the big trees. We had tickets but the time stamping ends at 5.30pm, though the times can be till later at night. You can only get up there at a particular time and you get your ticket stamped for that time. Cleverer people than me who had prepared well had their walk in the trees during the light show, which may well have been spectacular. Give that some thought if going.
All the enclosures cost money, but relatively the prices are reasonable. We paid about A$50 per person for the 3 domes and the skywalk.
Gardens of the Bay is simple but very creative and can easily keep you enchanted for a full day. It‚Äôs one of those must-sees that you really must see.",07-2019,,2020-01-21 22:41:07.553311

It‚Äôs been crafted as a feast for your senses. The Gardens are spectacular beyond your highest expectations. The pictures and videos we saw prior do not do it justice! To get the full experience, plan for an entire day. The Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and OCBC Skyway are a must. Seeing them all gets a bit pricey, but will be a once in a lifetime experience. The Skyway is best in the morning when it‚Äôs cool or at night when the lights are on. The views of the Supertrees and skyline are incredible. Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are a great way to cool off from the Singapore heat and are both botanical wonders. Make sure you get a re-entry stamp so you can revisit after walking around the outdoor gardens. For those with children, the free Children‚Äôs Garden is not to be missed. First of all, prepare for them to get wet! There is a great water feature where kids can play in their swimsuits. Our rowdy American kids ran straightaway into the feature with their clothes on. Then they played in the beautiful hidden forest playground that was paved with sand. Needless to say, they were a disaster afterwards. Thankfully there are showers and changing rooms available.

Flower Dome housed thousands of plant species, cactus, Singaporean Orchids, and colorful flowers. It‚Äôs really amazing to see how all these plants are well maintained under a huge glass structure and in a controlled temperature and overall environment. It‚Äôs equally enchanting to people of any age.

Cloud Forest, next stop is another man-made marvel. Cloud, artificial waterfall and mist, green and crystal garden will take any person to a different world at least for the time being.

Last but not the least there is SuperTree Grove light up. 18 supertrees of 25 to 50 meter heights give shade during the day and uses solar energy for the spectacular 15 minutes light show that starts after dawn and creates a ecstatic view of trees with lights on those. This is included in the ticket.

Going there is pretty easy as most of the tourists takes few minutes walk from the Bayfront MRT or walk over from the Marina Bay. I would recommend going there in the afternoon to take the opportunity to watch the spectacular light up.

,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/SharynHobartTasmania,704481150,08-2019,5,A must see when visiting Singapore,Gardens by the Bay are a must on your visit to Singapore and also for children of all ages. Totally fascinating seeing the types of trees and plants plus the display of flowers especially the Singapore Orchards in the flower section. They have a small train that takes you to view the tall trees and plants and the flower display so if you do not wish to walk to the pavilions you can view some of the other areas of the Gardens from there. Give yourself plenty of time there is so much to see and you will be left with a feeling of complete exhilaration with all of it it is simply a more than fabulous experience,08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:41:26.228388

Note - for a great view of the area head to LAVO restaurant at the top of Marina Bay Hotel (s$32 for a pizza).

The Flower Dome is incredible in size, content, variety and design. It takes your breath away when you walk in. I'm not sure how horticulturally pure it is, but the Baobab trees, cactus, orchids - I could go on - where amazing (the driftwood sculptures are a highlight). Whilst there is a main route there are corners to explore and the fact that there are multiple (but flowing) levels make it a unique space. Unlike many places in Singapore - no queueing (although MANY pictures being taken = congestion).

The Cloud Forest is almost as impressive, with a single focal point of an amazing 'mountain' with a waterfall cascading to the entrance (note - best waterfall experience in Singapore is at Jewel (Changi Airport)). Quite a bit less diverse than flower dome and use of stalagmites/stalactites jarred a little but the cloud walkway is amazing.

Supertree Garden. Recommend you do this at night. We didn't do the OCBC skyway (huge queue) but didn't feel like we missed out. We just lay on our backs under the trees and watched the whole area change colours with the trees and soaked up the atmosphere.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:41:31.049290

it still amazed us how they manage to sustain such a wide variety of plant life in the one dome eco system.

The main point of difference this time is the amount of people that were present. Even though we last travelled during school holidays, the amount of people visiting the gardens was much, much more.

As such you should allow more time to ensure you are able to properly see the entire domes. For instance, our last visit we walked straight into the elevator for the rain forest dome, but this time was a 25 minute wait.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:42:21.655539

We entered from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel entrance and down an escalator however you can cross under the road bridge next to the hotel and enter the gardens from the side road.
The view from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel entrance is spectacular, it has a really good vantage point to take photos of the tree walkway.
You have to buy tickets to up the walkway or enter the flower dome or cloud dome however all were worth it. The view from the walkway is amazing and good for photo opportunities. Not really for those who suffer from vertigo however I do but was still able to enjoy the walkway. We went up during daylight however on returning another evening we noticed that some people timed their trip up to coincide with the evenig 7:45 light show in the trees there. We viewed that light show from the ground but it was still excellent.
The flower dome is laid out in different counties eg Australia, South Africa, China, beautiful flowers and you the dome is air conditioned so you get a respite from the searing heat outside. The flower dome loos also have a water fountain. We were advised by the staff to fill our water bottles from the fountain towards the back of the dome as the water is chilled there. Water fountains elsewhere were luke warmish and not so good.
Enjoyed the cloud dome also. There is a lift up to the higher level and from there several walkways and escalators bring you back down where you can see crystals etc and stop at variation photo opportunity platforms.
We also ended up walking out to Satay by the Bay to finish with a meal at the hawker food market out that way. Excellent. Woudl recommend a visit and the food.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:42:26.694874

You must understand that there are many very different parts of this and can best be understood by going into their website and seeing the 10 different attractions that are all part of the Gardens by the Bay. Just click ""attractions"" on the website.

Perhaps the main attraction is the Supertree Grove. This can be seen during the day but it is absolutely wonderful at night during one of the two daily light shows which are free! It's a 15 minute show that should not be missed and make sure you bring the kids along if they are with you. Personally its best to visit during the day AND during the show at night and you will see two very different perspectives.

If you are visiting in the hot humid summer, plan on visiting the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, also part of Gardens by the Bay. I say especially in the summer because these are both indoor and the temperature is cool, in fact I suggest bringing a light jacket or sweater. There is a charge for both of these attractions.

As you will see from the website, there are many more attractions to visit, some of the others are also free.

Suggestion: Although it's pricy, the Sands Marina Hotel is right next to Gardens by the Bay. Stay here at this wonderful hotel and you will have easy access to the Gardens, day and night instead of taking taxi's, like we did, visiting the Gardens a number of times.",06-2019,,2020-01-21 22:43:21.426286

Anything else is a bonus. It is that good - an utterly astonishing achievement. A wonderland of delight. An incredible feast for the senses in every way.

These gardens are nothing short of amazing. We spent several hours here today just gasping at the size and scale of the place and the beauty everywhere. I have never taken so many photos. Every part of these gardens is utterly magnificent. I would not know where to begin describing them as there is so much to see. They are superbly and thrillingly designed. They are beautifully and meticulously maintained. It is a truly wondrous place. We spent four hours here. I‚Äôd really like to spend many many times more. Entrance to everything is not cheap. But gosh, is it worth it. It is worth every cent and more. It is an essential thing for everyone.

We went to an alleged botanic gardens in the great city of Rome last week. It was a once great space that is now sad and neglected. A shadow of a decent gardens due to inadequate resources and presumably lack of interest. The Singaporeans are doing the exact opposite. Their achievement with Gardens by the Bay says so much about their intelligence, energy, confidence and competence.

The gardens are free to enter however you have to pay 8S$ to the Skywalk and a further 28S$ for the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. We got a 10% reduction on the later price by presenting our Singapore Airlines Boarding card.

The whole park are is very large with plenty to see, eating places etc.

The Skywalk is approached by a lift which takes you up look out over the tops of the ‚Äòtrees‚Äô and gives you a walk in the sky to be able to appreciate these structures, the plants growing on them and wider views of the park.

The Flower Dome was quite busy as they had a special exhibition of orchids which showed their colours, scent and how spectacular they look en mass. The cloud Forest was interesting in that entered at the bottom of a 7+ storey waterfall.
From here you could walk around seeing the huge variety of plants before taking a lift to the top from you walked gently down to bottom seeing different plants, their environments etc.

With an area of 100 hectares of park and a lot of attractions for the whole family.

This park consists of three gardens in front of the water:

Bay Central garden which joins the other two gardens, a great place to enjoy panoramic views.

Bay South Garden is the largest of the three with 53 hectares, and here there are the most important attractions of this park:

Flower dome: It is a dome 38 meters high heated, where flowers from other climates are exhibited, such as Mediterranean, parts of Australia, South America and South Africa.
Cloud Forest is also another heated dome, higher and there it replicates the subtropical mountain climate.
The main attraction is the Cold Montain of 42 meters high, and the waterfall of 35 meters. All decorated with magnificent flowers and plants that grow in these conditions.
Supertree Grove, these super trees, are the stars of this park, are between 25 and 50 meters high and are vertical gardens, with technology that mimics the ecological function of natural trees.
Children's Gardens, a magnificent space for the little ones, can be enjoyed playing with water, in an area of dancing waters and there are also spaces with slides, sandboxes and more fun places to discover
Bay East Garden, quieter, 2 km next to the water, where you can enjoy some of the most spectacular views of Singapore.

If you are hungry, visit Satay By The Bay, a great place to enjoy satay and other delicious local food, while enjoying the views of the waterfront. Food Stalls open from 11am to 10pm daily, drinks stall open 24 hours.",05-2019,,2020-01-21 22:43:59.991228

You can enjoy tropical forrest and flora from around the world in air con domes. There is also new area exebition called Floral Fantasy.

How to get GBTB :
* taxi (very convinience)
* MRT (Bayfront mrt - prepare yourself for walking)

Facilities :
* wheelchair (rent available)
* restaurants

Time to spend :
It is a huge area! Download their map and they provide time estimation to visit some area there. I spent time at least 3 hours only to visit Flower Dome & Cloud Dome. Day and night would bring you difference experience.

Ticketing :
If you are in budget, walking around the area is actually free. Tickets sold separtely and bundling for Flower Dome, Clound Dome, and Floral Fantasy. Frequent visit ticket ""Friends of GBTB"" also available.

I always looking forward for the special flowers exebition as GBTB will show special collection 3-4 times a year (e.g Sakura, Dahlia, Tulip, and now Orchids). I enjoy the beauty of each plantation and flowers also the tranquil. However, don't go during peak season (weekend, holiday) as it would be too crowded. I annoyed with foreigner tourists who touch/pick the flowers or ruin the display only for selfie purpose, they also don't respect other guests. Better keep distance from them.

It is also recomended come early in the morning at 9 or evening. It could be very hot during middle of the day. Use your comfortable sneaker, wear hat, sunscreen, bring water. Make sure your camera/phone baterry is full and have spare phone memory.

When you visit Cloud Dome it is best when the mist is sprayed. Check in the entrance door. When you visit Floral Fantasy, check the schedule as the area is limited (got visitor quota) hourly. They could do better for the 4D ride. But the flower display is awsome!

Souvenir in GBTB also worth to buy, include they sell flower seeds.",08-2019,,2020-01-21 22:44:23.004700

The website notes that busy time at the gardens is 4pm to 7pm, so there may be lines, but we did not experience this. It seems that in Singapore, everyone is active earlier in the day before the midday heat, and after the midday heat is over.

The Flower Dome was impressive, beautifully organized and well maintained. It was amazing to see so many colorful varieties of flowers in one garden. The garden is divided by regions of the world with correlating plants or flowers from that region. There is plenty of space to sit and rest if need be. Be sure to bring your camera and your patience for crowds, as it is a popular tourist destination. The Cloud Forest displays a waterfall over a living mountain of flowers and plants. It is massive and gorgeous. Visitors can walk on different tiers of walkways to see this living mountain from different angles and perspectives. The Cloud Forest also has great displays and movies about the impact of global warming on Singapore, its people, and the world, which was eye opening and effective. We loved that both gardens were indoors and air conditioned, which was a pleasant break from the heat and humidity outside.

Make sure to keep your eye on the time and get a good seat for the night show in the garden. It is wonderfully choreographed and not to be missed. If you think you may get caught up in seeing the gardens and are rushing to the night show, bring snacks so you don‚Äôt starve.

We accessed the Gardens via the walkway from Marina Bay Sands and arrived into the Supertree Garden - huge metal structures with green plants climbing up the sides. The main area was free to access and we paid the 8 dollars to access the sky walkway - a small semi circular walkway high above the ground which can host about 50 people at a time. The walkway offered great views of the gardens, the large glass domes housing the indoor sections of the park and the Marina Bay Sands and singapore flyer big wheel beyond.

From the Super Trees we took the short walk to the Cloud Forest - a large glass domed indoor rainforest area which greets visitors with a large waterfall. Everywhere was lush and the air felt fresh and clear. The tickets for that and the flower dome were just under 30 dollars per person - good value.

We headed up in the elevator to the top of the dome and gradually worked our way down through incredible foliage and various wooden carvings along the walk. The scale and greenery was spectacular - a truly mind blowing experience.

Next up was the indoor flower park. Smaller in scale and slightly less impressive than the Cloud Forest but still a stunning area - filled with plants from
Around the world, each housed in their own area. Again, there were also wooden sculptures and a number of nice cafe options within the complex.

I conducted an orientation program at the venue for my CCA and it was pretty successful as students get to be outside of school and learn some new things that they won't usually know about.

Lovely waterfall scenic can give you a feeling of natural waterfall all the way from the mountains.

From the waterfront promenade, you will see a picturesque view of the city skyline.

Unique to Gardens by the Bay is the Cloud Forest in lush vegetation amidst the world‚Äôs tallest indoor waterfall.

The domes were not crowded. To our surprise we really enjoyed looking at the beautiful flowers in the flower dome, especially the orchids. The cloud forest was spectacular and clever the way it lead you around the main structure. The environment message was sombering and we wondered about the environmental impact of the domes themselves, we were glad that to finish off our visit we joined the 20 minute ride on tour which explained the function of the super trees and other measures taken to reduce the environmental impact of the attraction.

You need to go along during daylight hours to start your visit look around the domes and the trees. Then you need to wait until dusk when the domes light up and time it so you get a spot by the trees ready for the light show outside.

Best views of the light show is led down on the floor or wooden benching if you can find a spot. It is very popular. The light show lasts about 12 to 15 mins. and is synchronised to music.

Once the light show finishes you will find a great many people leaving the park, that is fine there are signs fot different exits. The problem is when you get out there are huge queues for taxi's. The taxis tend to get caught up in traffic leaving and traffic arriving.

We were told that it was nothing to wait up to an hour for a taxi. There are private taxi's and hire cars available, you will find people asking if you would like to beat the queues, but that comes at a price. We were not prepared to wait around as we had been on the go all day and just wanted to return to the hotel for a drink. The cost of the private hire was approximately 4 times the normal taxi fare (always ask the exact cost they are going to charge you before getting in).

It can be worth the extra if you are really tired. We shared the taxi with a couple who were staying at our hotel and that worked out about $11 sgd each Not really too bad, but for a single traveller it would be very expensive.

The bus stops adjacent to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. From there, it was a long and tiring walk in hot and humid conditions to the central part of the gardens where the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are located.
You do have the option on paying for rides on open people movers but in our humble opinion, if you do this, you may miss much of what there is to be seen.
On the day of our visit, the Supertree Grove & Skyway were closed for maintenance. This would have been a major disappointment for those who had specifically come to visit those attractions. It really was not much of a disappointment for us because there was just so much more to be seen and our time was limited.
After visiting the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest it was time for us to make our way back to the Marina Sands Hotel to reboard the Hop on. Hop off bus. Along the way, we paused briefly to visit some of the specialist small garden displays such as the Japanese Gardens.
By the time that we arrived back at the bust stop we were very hot and exhausted. However, we were happy that we had taken the time to make a return visit to these marvellous gardens!",05-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 22:48:43.040769

,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/lennardlim,692454234,07-2019,5,Lovely place to visit with the family,"We came here with friends and family to check this out and was very impressed. We took the scenic route there, walking through The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. If you walk all the way to the end you can get up to the top floor and walk along the outdoor terrace on the roof and get a really good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.

From here, you can walk across to the hotel and through it to get to the Gardens by the Bay on the other side. We were lucky enough to get complimentary entry to the Domes and the Skyway, but I think I would have happily paid to enter them. It should be noted that there's still a lot to see even without paying to enter either of these attractions and the light shows at 19:45 and 20:45 are free.

We were a little short on time and as we went during the day, we whizzed past the outdoor gardens. What we did see of them was very nice, but during the day the heat is pretty oppressive.

We checked out the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome and whilst both were impressive, the Cloud Forest is really cool. First thing you see is a huge waterfall. The air conditioning and spray from the waterfall will be a welcome relief if you've been outside in the heat for a while. The scale of both domes is really impressive and even if you only have a passing interest in anything horticultural, you can't help but be impressed with what's on display. You'll probably end up learning quite a lot from the information provided too. Note, it can get quite crowded in the Cloud Forest especially around the main photo taking points, although we were ok pushing a buggy around.

After whizzing around both domes, we went up into the Skyway. If you're not good at heights, be warned that the Skyway can be a little daunting. However, if you can make it at all, I would recommend it. Views are great from it and it provides a different perspective. It's relatively short and you're supposed to spend up to 15 minutes up there at peak times, however, at 8 SGD for an adult, it isn't the most expensive attraction in the world. It gets very busy at night particularly around the times of the light show and you have to get a time slot. We went around 6 pm and there was practically no queue. At 20:00 it was a different story and there was a substantial queue.

We then went to have dinner at the Supertree Foodhall, which has a selection of outlets from HK roast meats to Japanese to fried chicken. The added benefit of going here for food is that you're very close to the Supertrees to watch the light show. If you fancy bringing your own food, there are plenty of places to sit and eat outdoors.

The Mesmerising Garden Rhapsody Show, or the light show, is about 15 minutes long and is basically lights mounted on the Supertrees coordinated to music. That makes it sound very basic, but it is actually quite nice to watch. If you can, get amongst the trees and the place is generally clean enough for you to lie on the floor and look up at the trees. My kids were mesmerised enough to actually lie still the whole time. Bring some mozzie spray as there is a small risk of being bitten at night. MRT stations can get very busy in the evening, and we walked to a further MRT station, Bayfront, which brings you around the Marina Sands complex.

All in all, well worth a visit or two and you can easily spend the whole day here.",07-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:48:57.031038

We had allocated one day to the Gardens by the Bay and we decided to buy the combined tickets for three attractions plus unlimited Shuttle Service rides (only needed those to get to the Floral Fantasy on time). It was worth it! We could not visit all 101 hectares - but we had a good go!

The Cloud Forest dome contains the world's tallest indoor waterfall (30 metres) so you go up in a lift and walk down on a pathway that goes out into the air so that you can look back and get a good view.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world and gives an experience of spring everyday. As well as plants from Mediterranean and semi-arid regions, there are quirky sculptures and models to make you smile.

Floral Fantasy is the newest addition, with floral arrangements over four themes (not that we noticed). It is time-ticketed because, after you complete the quite short walk through the ""garden"" you queue to get into the 4-D theatre for a 3-D film representing the flight of a dragonfly with flight simulator (moving seat) effects, complete with fragrances and sprays of water. The kids might enjoy it, but I felt it was a bit overrated.

But beyond the indoor gardens, there are loads more outdoors with the Dragonfly and Kingfisher Lakes and surroundings (free!). To be honest, we did not have time to visit the Skyway, though you can walk under the Supertrees. We stayed on into the night to see the sound and light show (which for us involved the advertising of Toy Story 4 projected on to 2-D cloud shapes between the Supertrees), as well as the Supertrees changing colours.

All in all, a very full afternoon and evening! Highly recommended! It is amazing that Singapore has managed to make a success out of these very modern gardens as well as the more traditional Botanic Garden - don't miss either!",06-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:48:57.271136

Bring your walking shoes, and be prepared for lots of people! Gardens by the Bay is much bigger than it looks, so you'll be doing a lot of walking. It is, however, air conditioned in the covered areas, so at least you'll have a break from the heat.

One can spend a great deal of time among the flowers and you can take endless selfies.There are also cactus,baobab tree etc etc.The forest has a huge waterfall which gushes down and also a small orchid garden that has fragarant orchids.

I rang to enquire if we could get the tickets and go later (with Buffalo Tours) but they said no. I asked if there were breakfast options at Gardens By The Bay - he said ""You'll never go hungry in Singapore.""

However - we did! There were about 10 listed dining options in the brochure. We spent an hour to an hour and a half trying to located each and every one of these ""dining options"" with very unsuccessful results. Every single place at 9.30/10am was closed, all except McDonald's (which I've never been to in my life and won't start now!) and a cafe next door to it which looks like it belongs in a third world country!

So we left to go and have breakfast elsewhere and never saw Gardens By The Bay, except while looking for the food options.

All the staff were EXTREMELY unhelpful and gave us incorrect information and directions. We were constantly told to go different way to exit - one person said to go upstairs, which we did, but the man upstairs told us to go downstairs.

It was a really frustrating and horrible experience, so we did not bother to go back during the day to use our pre-bought wasted tickets.",07-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:49:15.470840

On arrival at the ticket office we were told we had to buy a combined Cloud Forest and Flower Dome ticket despite explaining we did not have time to visit both.
The queue to enter the Forest was not too bad, although maintaining any form of personal space was almost impossible! Our first view of the Forest was lovely but this is also where things started to go downhill.
We were herded into lifts to reach the top floor which was challenging if you are at all claustrophobic. On reaching the top floor there were large numbers of people and it was difficult to see anything without being bumped or pushed. Any hope of finding a quiet spot to take in the surroundings was impossible. Floating walkways take you down each level where you can view the many differing plants and also views of Singapore. The walkway may be difficult if you have a fear of heights.
On one level there is an educational section with film show explaining mans‚Äô global impact but most people just walked through without stopping. A real educational opportunity missed!!
Really the sheer numbers going through the forest at one time completely spoiled the experience for our party of 7. Collectively we agreed we would have had a more enjoyable experience just walking through the gardens and enjoying the evening light show which we just caught the end of.

Of the two domes, if you only have one to see, it is the cloud dome. The flower dome is beautiful, but has an element of complete random placement of flowers which is a bit off-putting.

There are some areas focused on environmental protection and renewable energy that are well presented.

It is free to visit the garden (but e.g. the Domes and Skyway require entry fees). The Gardens are so beautiful, clean and pristine and not a flower out of place. You also get an excellent view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in its entirety. The Tree Grove is probably around the middle of the Gardens and you can buy tickets to walk on the Skyway (which I recommend too, you get an elevated view of the Gardens and the Hotel).

However here‚Äôs my take on some of the exhibits. To my surprise, the grounds at gardens by the bay are admission free. Which is generous considering everywhere you walk inside the park grounds you‚Äôre struck with beautiful foliage and futuristic (Avatar like) views.

We got there just after noonish and it was nice as the crowds were minimal. Most people come later in the evening to watch the light show at the supertrees which is also free but extremely crowded. I‚Äôd advise you to get a seat under the supertrees at least an hour early for the best views.

We did however pay the admission fee to enter the Cloud forest and the flower dome. Here‚Äôs ‚Äúmy‚Äù opinion on the two exhibits. Cloud forest is 10/10 must see. Absolutely gorgeous from every angles and that is immediately present at the waterfall entrance. The flower dome however was nice but not anything special. If you like random trees and large succulents from around the world then I‚Äôd recommend this exhibit. But take what I‚Äôm going to say next seriously! If you plan to visit both exhibits, do yourself a favor and go to the flower dome FIRST.

It‚Äôs two huge ‚Äúeco domes‚Äù house the ‚ÄúCloud Forest‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlower dome‚Äù habitats, filled with a fascinating array of plants, trees and shrubs.

The whole experience is very futuristic, from the soaring alien-like palm towers to the domes themselves, which feel like some kind of future city.

You can visit the outside areas, gardens and sculptures for free and certain areas are hugely popular with joggers, especially in the early evening. Entry to the two domes costs S$28 per person , but we booked through our travel rep and got four tickets for S$100.

The Cloud forest dome is centred around a great tropical waterfall. Queue for the lift which takes you all but 1 flight of stairs from the top, then walk your way back down, following the Aerial walkways and bridges that slope their way back down to the ground (a few stairs along the way). Great views out of the dome to the city and lots of amazing rain forest plants and flowers to admire as you go.

The flower dome starts with displays of cacti and succulents, moves through tropical plants and vegetation, includes orchids and finishes with a Rose garden, all easily accessible from sloping paths (also a few steps in places). The sheer size of both domes is incredible.

As if all this wasn‚Äôt enough, a short walk from the domes is the Mega Park, where the massive Palm shaped towers, connected by soaring aerial walkways, dominate the whole park. These huge structures are planted all the way up and give the impression of living buildings. The real magic happens after dark however when the towers light up and become the centre of a nightly free music and light show.

This is when you get the full futuristic city experience as colourful lighting brings the towers to life in time to classical music. To say the sight is breathtaking, would be an understatement, it is a memory that will stay will me for life.

I absolutely loved our time here and can‚Äôt recommend this enough. Visit the gardens in late afternoon, do the domes first then have an early evening meal in one of the on-site eateries (take the short walk to ‚ÄúSatay by the bay‚Äù for affordable food in the outdoor food court).

Then return to the Mega Park for night-fall and the free light shows, which take place at 7:45 and 8:45pm. Tickets for the ‚Äúskyway‚Äù aerial walk ways are S$8 and are pre-booked by time slot, so wait for your preferred time to go on sale and then buy quickly. We bought ours for 8:20pm, watched the earlier light show and then did the sky walk for magical views of the city by night.

Do not hesitate to visit Gardens by the bay if you are visiting Singapore and especially if you have children and teenagers. It is an amazing experience for them.

Our tour company, Tour East recommended that we visit around 5.30pm in the afternoon to make sure we got the early light show and this was fantastic advice. Our tour guide said he has visited many times and he suggests this time because you get to see the Gardens in the light and then it starts getting dark and you see them from a different perspective. We were then able to get up into the Super Trees about 7.15pm to enjoy the best of the light show.

I would recommend that you pre-book with Tour East to have this same experience. You will see the Domes in the light and then as they get darker - the Gardens begin to change and then you enjoy the light show. It's amazing!!!",07-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:50:31.069829

The other dome is more inspiring with a lovely waterfall and a fabulous walkway and plant selection.

However however in this world we live in, we always compare to prior experiences and I have to compare to Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in Richmond England and The Eden project in Exeter area of England...both are so much more spectacular, real and take your breath away that's it's difficult to be impressed by the Singapore experience.",07-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:51:08.350853

The sky walk is a different perspective and equally lovely. The 4d ride is ok. A bit tame but basically offers a dragon flys view of the gardens etc. You are the Dragon fly and there are some Disney chair effects to highlight your flight through the gardens. Nice not great.

Incorporating 2 glass houses and an outdoor garden; try and arrange the outdoor area walk when it is not raining as we did on suggestion by a guide. You are fully protected from the rain once inside one of the two domed glasshouses(largest in the world).
The outdoor garden alone is beautiful (look for the beautiful palm walk, peaceful meadow and pond of colourful goldfish) but the jewel in the crown is the Cloud Forest.
We also had a light lunch at Pollen in the flower dome which was nice and reasonably priced for Singapore. There are plenty of discreet eating options inside the entire complex.
We missed the light show this time but did the sky walk at an additional $8S each.

I‚Äôd say you should visit there especially two domes; floral dome and cloud forest. Both places are in well maintained status.
During my visit, there is a Rose show inside. It is nice, but it doesn‚Äôt contain various type of roses, just decorate space with roses. It is a bit disappointed, but still enjoy with landscape at overall.
In cloud forest, highlight is artificial waterfall. That ‚Äòs it. It is not obvious better than other botanical gardens in other countries. With limited space, you can enjoy walking tree top walk from upstairs down to ground. I like this idea which bring you a value to visit the place.
For QCBC skywalk, it costs S$8, but you need to get an admission session and be in line for 20 min. Then you can enjoy 15 min( peak hour) or a bit longer. To me it is not worth.

There has been lots of effort into these magnificent garden creations. Make sure you have plenty of time to wander around. It was also suggested to visit the Gardens By the Bay in the late afternoon so you are still there for the evening 8 pm when the Famous Tree light show starts. The Tree Tops walk will cost you an extra $8 but is worth it as long as you aren't scared of heights. There is also a tram that will drive you around the gardens for $3 which can be good in the heat while allowing you to see more of the Garden Park.,07-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 22:53:01.892975

Other than the fantastic towering light trees, the massive indoor dome provides a great experience in air conditioned comfort. It costs S$28 to get in, but it is well worth it. The exhibit is efficiently laid out and crowds can move through the place in a one-way, orderly fashion. As you wind your way through, various habitats are revealed, each with different plants and flowers. There is signage, but it can be hard to read with all of the people around. It would have been nice if they had offered a self-guided audio tour, but I did not see one on offer. As you come into the second dome, you are greeted by a massive waterfall. You then proceed up a lift to the ""cloud Walk."" This winds around from the top of the dome through various habitats and the back side of the waterfall. At the end of the journey, you can view a film about the future if climate change continues unchecked. And then you have to go through the obligatory gift shop before exiting. The outdoor gardens are equally impressive, but the heat and humidity of Singapore made that more of a perfunctory visit.

The Garden Rhapsody light and sound show is a definite must visit and if you have time the flower dome and cloud forest look like good places to visit as well.

Certainly a sight to behold of the tremendous work done to bring all sorts of plants and botanical beauties into Singapore. A rare chance to see cacti blooming etc.
What made my trip less perfect was the wait for the first night lighting of the famous supertrees. By themselves, they are majestic.
Unfortunately, perhaps some clever fella decided to work with Disney Toy Story 4 to combine some Woody character and Buzz Light Year into the lighting show. Some poorly design quality screens disguised as floating clouds frame the show. Woody and friends are seen hopping from one screen to another. No sense of design, choreography or any outstanding wow moments. It is definitely a poor combination of forced marketing and also venue desperation to try to brand further.
In this case, both brands suffered. They should have stayed as separate entities and strengthen their own brands than to allow each other to be diluted due to poor performance of one.",06-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 22:54:43.239377

Out of all the sectioned gardens, the succulent garden is absolutely amazing. All the plants are curated to perfection. We were also lucky enough to see their rose installation (which goes through to mid July). While it was impressive, there were a lot of the same rose about. I wished there were some more varieties, however that is a very small gripe as the amount of roses in there is phenomenal.

Having no expectations, I was amazed by Cloud Forest, just as I was the Flower Dome. It was such a nice surprise to see it all laid out. Leave yourself an hour our two to cover both the CF and FD.

There is a walkway which is entitled the lost world, poor choice of description given the association with the movie. Its just a high walkway to look down on the plants.
The flower dome was much better with the dome divided into different world regions.

I recommend visiting the main attractions which are the two conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) and the Supertree Grove.

The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome both require an admission which can be purchased as a package of the two for $28 ($20 for Singapore residents).

The Flower Dome is an extensive display of floral growth from regions around the world, which in turn are subdivided into 8 separate gardens. The majority of the species in the flower dome are endemic only to limited areas.

The Cloud Forest is a replica of the tropical and subtropical mountainous forests that experience frequent cloud cover. Inside the mountain, there are exhibits on endangered species and climate change along with the cloud and treetop walks.

Supertree Grove is an assortment of treelike structures and the OCBC skyway gives a great view of the garden as a whole and the area.

I highly recommend visiting the conservatories and Supertree Grove if you are short on time as it is less time consuming than strolling through the entirety of the park and is fascinating.",06-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:56:57.438446

Be careful to avoid Weekends to avoid rush.
Its a family destination / attraction.
The entry to the park and most attractions inside (scenic beauty) is free.
there are two domes ...one is a Rose Garden equivalent and second is tropical forest equivalent. Both are a treat in itself.
However, i cant comment much about these two as i avoided going inside as it was already a long day and i had other commitments.
Subsequently there is a wonderful lights and sound show.
There are 2 shows ...one each scheduled at 8 & 9 pm ....Both for 15 mins. Worth a watch.
There is a sky walk at the attraction for which you pay about $8 per person. This can be avoided if you are going to MBS Skypark.
It can be avoided otherwise also.
Please do not plan to see the Light and Sound show if you choose to go to the Skywalk....you will miss the entirity of the show. It looks best from the ground.
Lastly there is a restaurant at the top....If you are a couple...can plan for a dinner date here. But Indians ....be ware of the menu...it has limited options which most Indians may or amy not like !",06-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 22:57:05.802438

The walk in and around was our most pleasant on a hot day. We approached it after a lunch at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. We had the tickets to the two major conservatories, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. On the way there was a Children's garden with sprinklers that the young ones in our group really enjoyed

The Cloud Forest dome was up first and they have replicated a real mountain complete with vegetation and atmosphere in there. There are periodic cloud formations and mist with sign boards explaining every plant and bush as you move upwards. A lift takes you right to the top and you walk in a downward spiral, seeing everything from carnivorous plants to vanishing endangered species. A tall waterfall is the central show-piece of this attraction. There are audio video presentations explaining the dangers of humans encroaching on rain forests.

Up next was the Flower dome , full of colour and vigour. They have changing themes throughout the year, Tulips was the theme when we visited. There was a large restaurant at the bottom of this dome which was occupied for a private party at the time of our visit.

Apart from the two domes, many small gardens with themes like Sun Pavilion and Water Rocks can also be visited free of cost. The Skywalk is something we didn't opt for although it did look interesting. The Ice Creams and Gelatos outside the Flower dome are a must try too.",05-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 23:00:10.190474

We started with the Flower Dome which impressed us all, and then moved on to the Cloud Forest which absolutely blew us away, followed by the hawker center called Satay by the Bay (which was disappointing) and then on to the Supertree Grove with a musical light show that was amazing. Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest require payment and if you visit both then you get a reduced rate, I think on Klook they charge S$23 for each attraction and S$28 to visit both.

We took our family for a late afternoon visit. It was very busy with locals and visitors.

We really wanted to see the gardens by night, especially the the elevated sky walk.

Some pointers for those with young families:

- suggest getting there mid afternoon to visit each of the 2 x domes. Depending on how busy it is, can take an hour rushed per dome;
- if it is busy, prepare for mayhem. It is well organised but queues are long and depending on the time of year can be hit and sweaty;
- take plenty of water;
- plan your trip, prepaid tickets have benefits but have to be collected are the main entrance;
- the elevated sky walk, but book tickets early and be prepared to queue. If you are looking to be on the bridge at dusk, plan your timing;
- the MRT (local tube) is a convenient way to get to and from the venue;
- the local cafe and restaurants and petty good, feed the kids before queuing!

The gardens are immaculately kept, with lots of information on both plants and ecosystems. I arrived after lunch and walked around for about an hour initially.

The domes (cloud dome and flower dome) were paid entry (I bought mine online earlier) and absolutely stunning. I chose to do these after my initial walk around mainly to cool off! Both were fantastic, but I really did feel the experience of enjoying the flowers and trees was marred by constantly dodging people taking photos of themselves. It was like the whole dome was one giant photo op. It was annoying as hell. But the flowers were lovely. The cloud dome was based on a giant indoor manmade waterfall - again photo dodging aside, excellent. The real value was in the after dome experience with a section devoted to environmental issues. I thought this was excellent.

I then headed off to a cafe in the gardens for tea, and proceeded to the excellent heritage gardens. A final walk by the giant baby statue and over dragonfly bridge took me to Marina Bay Sands to de garden for a while.

I headed back to see the supergrove trees lit up after 7pm and had a final walk around at night.

We arrived first thing in the morning around 9am to miss the crowds. Definitely a good idea as an hour had gone past and there were certainly a larger flood of crowds.

We visited the following:

1. Cloud Forest Dome

2. Supertree Grove and OCBC Skyway

3. Flower Dome

Our favourite was the Cloud Forest. You enter a temperate climate dome (a cooling break from the usual Singapore equatorial temperatures) and are welcomed by a huuuuge indoor waterfall. You‚Äôll reach the top of the dome and then make your way down via bridges and internal stairs. A lovely variety of flora and fauna to interest both old and young.

The Supertree Grove and Skyway is what you would normally see on Singapore‚Äôs tourist literature. We had to buy a separate ticket for this. A great view from the top of the skyway, looking over the gardens and the iconic Marina Bay Sands. We‚Äôd picked a sunny, blue-sky morning to get some great pics, but beware of the heat. Make sure you visit in the morning to escape the crowds. There is a limited number of persons allowed on the Skywalk.

The Flower Dome is a lovely, open space expanse. It was Christmas time so they had a Tsum Tsum Disney feature. We actually got roped into a YouTube video that day which was quite funny and embarrassing for us. Lots of varieties of plants and very interesting.

We had problems working out how to get there and ended up getting a taxi. Once there we realised there is a $3 shuttle from the nearest MRT station Bayfront. It is a loop and the $3 would get you back and forwards all day. Get a stamp on your wrist to do the return trip (or all day) at no extra charge.

If you wish to dine at the Pollen Cafe right in the gardens do make a booking as only a few tables are in the shade.

If you plan to do a morning and then a late afternoon/early evening vist get the wrist exit stamp as well.

If you are traveling with Sigapore Airlines take your boarding passes for 10% discount.

The Flower Dome is also nice but nowhere as good as the Cloud Forest - which is full of flowers anyways.

Final trick - do check online for opening hours and days of being open. There are some bizzarre items - like closed on a Tuesday if Monday is a public holiday. There are also closed for maintenance days

The most useful part were the lockers! As we were transiting, we had our heavy backpacks with us and as it was quite warm/humid, we didn't really want to lug around kgs of stuff so we were able to store them in lockers for S$4.

All in all we were not disappointed. The gardens themselves are beautiful. We probably only covered a small percentage of it due to the heat/humidity but it was great to explore. I do suggest taking some drinks as you will need to take a few breaks.

The much photographed Super Trees were nice to see. We didn‚Äôt bother doing the skywalk between the Super trees as it‚Äôs not as high as we expected and to be honest the views from the Marina Bay Sands SkyPark (which we had done just beforehand )make any other raised views of the park a bit insignificant.

The domes themselves were a great visit. Both for a break from the humidity but also the sheer size, scale and experience. While we were visiting the Cherry Blossom in the Flower Dome was in full bloom, which meant that the crowds were huge. It was difficult to take any nice photos and at times hard to see the flowers for people taking selfies. The Cloud Forest however, was less busy and has a better flow to the crowds. The construction itself is incredible, but the planting makes it an amazing place to visit.

Food wise, I would recommend the Satay by the Bay. A short walk from the domes along the bay side. Not the best Hawker food in Singapore (it is a high bar after all!), but still good value and a break from the crowds. Plus you may well get to see the family of Otters on the walk ( as seen on David Attenborough‚Äôs ‚ÄúWild City‚Äù documentary.)",04-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 23:04:02.935911

We recently visited the Floral Fantasy, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest as well as a walk through the gardens. Unfortunately the Skyway was closed for maintenance that day (1 day a month).

The conservatories are air conditioned, and an architectural marvel. The displays are by turns colossal, intricate, a riot of colour and fifty shades of green and brown; beautifully tended and nurtured. The planning and cost of maintenance must be mind boggling!

There are a number of educational areas on climate change, the environment and sustainability; interesting and informative.

There are plenty of places for food and to take a break. We stopped at Bakerzin for coffee (excellent!) and a tasty snack. There are plenty of menu items, all very reasonably priced.

We spent just the morning but you could easily spend the entire day, and then return for more!

Large spacious outdoor garden with collection of plants and herbs with setting featuring collection from various region as themes. There is also a child water play park.Situated next to the sea, the area is breezy and many park users are seen exercising and having family activities in the morning and evening. The sky bridge allow for a good aerial view of the surrounding at an affordable price. There is also free light show at the Giant Tree structures every night.

The two bio-domes, architectural wonders in their own right as they are built using pillar free structure with plenty of natural light let in, are named Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both these domes are air-conditioned to keep the environment optimal for the floral and plants in there. The Cloud forest features plants and flowers living in high altitude, lime stone structures as well as an interactive education area with short video filming on climate change. Walkways are built up in the air to gives the feeling of visit and viewing to high altitude ... looks very futuristic. There is a high indoor waterfall as well.
Flower Dome features flowers and plants from different countries in permanent display as well as a Themed Central Display area that features different seasonal bloom at different periods in the year like Cherry Blossom, Tulips etc. These are crowd favorite.

Food is no issue as there are plenty of eateries in the area including a hawker centre style area at Satay by the Bay with many different food stalls featuring food from different area as well as a big concentration of mini restaurants at the main area as well as the Meadows.

Within walking distance is the Marina Barrage which is worth a visit to know about Singapore's journey towards water self-sufficiency as well. After walking in the park, drop over to the iconic Marina Bay Sands for shopping and more food.

The place is well connected with MRT and buses serving the area as well. Worth a visit to this Singapore Icon.

Weird sculptures and Stalicmites are scattered around the place. Love to have a ‚Äòquiet‚Äô rule as the squealing of the masses is quite unpleasant. The plant life is great. The quality and condition of the gardens great. The light show- lots of fun. The ‚Äòretro‚Äô event should encourage dancing as we plow through the disco era. Great space. Overloved tho.

There was a shaded area to sit by the waterpark but the waterpark itself was not shaded. There wasn't much shade in general. After the waterpark, we walked to Satay by the Bay, a outdoor eating area.

,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/kelccm,672444022,05-2019,5,"Garden of the future, right in the middle of the city","Mention Singapore's Garden By The Bay, most would think of its 2 fantastic dome(Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), and the gigantic Supertrees. However these are just a small portion of what you can find at the area called Bay South. Garden By The Bay consists of 3 waterfront gardens, Bay South, Bay East and Bay Central.
Most of the main attractions can be found at Bay South, and its the nearest to the MRT station. My favorite would be the Cloud Forest, an indoor forest, with a regulated climate similar to mountain top, in which the waterfall is the center piece. With a few levels showcasing different flora at varying altitude.
The Flower Dome showcases many different species of flowers from different regions. The flowers get updated on a regular basis based on the season, like in March, the lovely sakura flowers and even a row of torii gates were showcased.
For a bird eye view of the whole garden, I would highly recommend visiting the OCBC Skyway, a hanging bridge linking 2 supertrees.
For families with young kids, your kids would loved the Childre's Garden, where they can play in the water playground. The best thing is this playground is free.
There are more you can explore. In the morning or evening, the garden is a very nice relaxing place to take a stroll or jog. You can also cycle or skate on the path at the waterfront.
For a fantastic view of the city skyline, the domes and even SIngapore Flyer, make your way to Bay East.",03-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 23:05:36.445111

1. A beautiful garden right in the middle of the city (well almost!) to enjoy either a leisurely walk in the evenings (preferable) and take in some fresh air and get some exercise. The place is also then decorated for different festivals and celebrations. A treetop walk lets you get a treetop view of the surroundings.

2. Two beautifully curated exhibition spaces for flora & horticulture from literally around the world that is well maintained and thriving. Both, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, are a must visit. One showcasing the plants from all corners of the world while the other housing a man made waterfall and providing a lush forest like place to walk around. A real stress buster or place to rejuvenate yourself.

There may be a long waiting time for the elevator inside the Cloud Forest, but once you‚Äôve been taken up to the top (it‚Äôs six floors high!) you can wander back down at your own pace and leisure.
The Flower Dome had a tulip display when we were there, and we found it difficult to get to the main display because of the crowd, but we were still happy with what we‚Äôd seen.
It was dusk by the time we left both domes, so the Flower Funnels were lit up out in the gardens, they truly are a sight to behold. And the Marina Bay Sands was looking resplendent as a back drop.

The indoor air conditioned domes house the meticulous plantings of the world. You can see Holland tulips, California palm trees, and even a life sized Lego display popping out among huge ferns.

Find a spot in the middle and sit on the concreteor steps (the whole place is very clean) and don't miss the show. (If you want a taxi home after suggest booking one in advance, otherwise you'l queu with a hundred other folk for one - it's only 10 mins walk to the MRT at the Bayfront). THe skyway walk is ok, and worth doing forthe few quid it costs to get a good view, note this is quieter in the mornings!

Supertree structures 'mushroooming' towards the clouds housing 'creeper schrubs' envoloping them and 'boasting' an incredible light shows at 19:45hr & 20:45hr nightly illuminating the night accompanied by tantalising music we were at awe and excitement!

The OCBC Skywalk - bridge 'hanging' in the air bringing thrilling moments strolling from one supertree to another with breathtaking view of the sea, the bird's eye view of the gardens and the iconic Marina Bay Sands and Singapore' beautiful city skyline. We can see Indonesia from there too. The epic was our out of this world experience in the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. They are 2 gigantic glassdomes with temperature cooler than the exterior yet NO AIRCONDITIONER used i was told! Magical! The permanent display in the Flower Dome are trees more than 1000 years old and the entire display in it are based on a theme of the period. We were there and Tulips was the main exhibition. It felt like we were in Holland with all the decor of that indoor garden cleverly done to suit the theme. Cloud Forest at one instant truly made us imagine we were walking on clouds with those mist and gorgeous vertical landscape and odd shaped bridges going in and out of it with freshness in the air it make you feel healthier from before entering these paradiso!

The next day we paid to go into the two domes - these were a real welcome relief as the temperature inside is about 15 degrees - I would recommend the flower dome first which is well maintained and has various beautiful flowers in each area - we then went to the cloud forest / the waterfall on entrance is an obvious highlight but then you walk down through the trees and was really enjoyable.

The Gardens by the Bay offers delight to eyes and mind. Vast area full of different gardens and the renewable energy harvesting Super-tree grove is a sight to behold.

Be prepared to walk a lot as this area is huge. Starting from the ticketing counters, one can either walk over the dragonfly bridge (recommended) or take a shuttle to the flower dome. Walking is recommended unless you are short of time or came here to only visit the cloud forest or flower dome.

Crossing the dragonfly bridge, you reach the gardens and from here you have various options to explore. Either go for the cloud forest or flower dome or take in the sights of super-tree grove along with a sky bridge that connects two of the biggest artificial trees. If you dont want to do any of these, then just explore different themed gardens.

Entry to the gardens and the supertree grove is free, you need to buy tickets for the cloud forest, flower dome and OCBC skyway. Shuttle sets you back another $3 per person.

Be prepared to spend a good amount of time and take pleanty of photos. Suggestions on spending time
- Flower Dome - 1 - 1.5 hours
- Cloud Forest - 1 hour
- OCBC Skyway - 30 mins
- Rest of the gardens - until you are satisfied (But a minimum of 2 hours)

Keep in mind that on holidays and certain times, there would be queue for the skyway.

Also, the light show at the end 7:45pm and 8:45 pm are worth watching, Come to the super tree grove and find a place in a round shaped lawn that offers the best views. Make sure to come early and reserve your spot!

This time we decided to take a closer look expecting to spend a couple of hours at most walking around. Boy were we wrong!

Those ""couple of hours"" stretched into almost the entire day.

TGBTB has two bits.

(1) Extensive free walks and gardens.

(2) The pay-an-admission venues:
(a) OCBC tree walk (SG$8 pp) and
(b) the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories (SG$28 pp).

If you're on a tight budget, you can have quite a nice time with the free bits.

If you can afford it, the conservatories are worth the visit.

Re the free bits, there is a nice walk around the perimeter of TGBTB. Some of the many sites to see are: The boardwalk along Kingfisher and Dragonfly Lakes. The Chinese, Japanese, Malay and Colonial Gardens. A rock garden. A heritage plant garden, etc. Lots to see. Lots of nice walks.

Now to the paid attractions.

The OCBC Skywalk is relatively short, but you'll get some great views not only of the surrounding area but also a look down on trees. See the attached a tree turns into a flower picture. When there are lots of visitors, expect to be moved along for a 15minute stay.

Flower Dome is quite extensive. There's a mind boggling amount to see. More signage describing the plants would be ideal.

Cloud Forest has the tallest indoor waterfall in the world according to TGBTB..

In addition to permanent exhibits, there are seasonal ones.

Right now Tulipmania (until 20 May) a massive collection of tulips @ Flower Dome.

And Scentsational Orchids (until 22 September) @Cloud Forest - various types of orchids classified by scent type along with the reasons for the scents. What sort of pollinators are the plants seeking to attract, etc.",04-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 23:08:15.809475

Bring on the botanics, the horticultural stuff, the lights and you have a crowd-pleaser. Air-conditioning for plants and humans in humid Singapore is never a bad thing. And the tulips are now the 'flavour of the season' and the crowd is suitably enthused.

There are many other attractions at the GBB but because of time limitation/s, we went to the FLOWER DOME and the CLOUD FOREST.

I saw the light show from the ground as well as from the roof of my hotel (Marina Bay Sands) and I have to say it is so much better when you are on the ground! The shows are at 7:45 & 8:45 PM each night, but I recommend arriving at least 30 - 45 minutes in advance in order to get a decent spot (they are all pretty good). You can also be on the Skyway during it, but have to get there super early for that as they have entry times during the light show.

The music is great, the lights are mesmerizing, and it's like nothing you have ever seen before. If you do nothing else in Singapore - come to Gardens By The Bay. It is 100% worth the visit and I cannot wait to go back to Singapore just to go here!",04-2019,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 23:08:38.328713

Got to say comming from Seitzerland with the flower island Mainau nearby that was a let down. It felt a bit like seeing the Garania flowers from grandpa. Considering the mysthic cloudy mountain this was a bit of a let down.

We visited in January and found it warm and humid but to be honest we probably would find it very uncomfortable later in to the year, summer temps could be unbearable worth thinking about if planning a trip to Singapore.

We used the superb MRT to get there. Something we did all the time in Singapore and that took us pretty much straight to the ticketing entrance.
You can wander around the gardens for free but you have to pay a relatively modest amount to get entry to the two domes. When we arrived the rain had caused the skywalk to be closed which was a shame.
We wandered through the gardens to the domes and did the rainforest one first. It was busy but a combination of good layout and good organisation meant you were always walking. It was a fascinating experience and a shame that so many of the visitors seem to point the camera the wrong way. When nature is so stunning how many selfies can you need people????
You walk around the dome at various levels giving different perspectives as you go around the elevated platforms. There is plenty to read but we mainly looked.
The flower dome was less spectacular but still extremely good. Again the selfie brigade staring at a rose were probably as entertaining as the flora itself.
After this we started to walk away for a drinks break only to realise the skywalk was open. Excellent. Not very expensive at $8 and a wait for less than 10 minutes (you have allocated time slots). More amazing photos to be had.
Then finally at 7:45 (and again at 8:45) the light show. Amazing. Retro 70s music and stunning visuals. Well worth waiting for.

My 3yo son and both my husband and I loved the light show at gardens by the bay. It goes for about 15 mins and is wonderful to just rest and be immersed and lost in the moment.

We were a group of 10, 6 adults and 4 kids aged 11,12,13,14. There is so much to see!
We bought an online package through Klook for the Cloud Dome and Flower place as well as the Skyway walk for about $28 per adult or something.
On the day we went my niece was really sick but still wanted to go, but was exhausted walking around so we tried to get her a wheelchair. They hire them out for $2, just need photo ID (AU drivers licence was ok) but only to the elderly. So we got my Mum (62yrs) to pretend it was for her and then when we got to the domes they switched over.
The domes are amazing and you really need to allow at least an hour for each one.
We had planned to do it all on one night but ran out of time to do the Sky walk so we went back a 2nd night to do that. We got there about 7pm hoping to catch the light show at 7:45 and then do the walk however, we didn't realise even though we had a ticket, we had to get a time slot ticket. The earliest we could get was 8:40pm. So we found a spot to watch the light show and then waited until 8:20 to line up for the Skyway. The bonus of this was that while up there the 2nd viewing of the light show started so we got to see it from the ground as well as the top. It is a fabulous place and you can spend a lot of time there if you want. If you go between 11am-1pm they have driverless cars!! Going in the evening was great seeing it by day and leaving by night and it was just a stroll over to the Shoppes at Marina Bay where you can catch the 8pm or 9pm light show them head to Rasapura for dinner.

The Flower Dome has a very diverse exhibit of flowers, they are from all over the world, from Baobabs in Africa to cherry blossoms from Japan. It is amazing how they get all of them to grow in basically the same climate.

Now, if you want to go onto the OCBC Skywalk in the Supertree Grove, you absolutely have to buy a ticket. I think you can buy in advance, but definitely do not walk up to the ticket office when you want to go. There was a 2 hour wait when we went. There is also a restaurant in the tallest one, Indochine, which would allow you to have a similar view. They did a light show with classical music that was really fun to see. Definitely recommend this attraction.

You can get here by cab or bus, or you can walk through the Marina Bay Sands shops and hotel, which isn‚Äôt too bad.",04-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 23:10:08.391682

Great exhibits in both the rainforest dome and the Flower Dome.

Lots of information about environmental damage and ways we can help including information boards exhibits and video films. The domes are self sustaining so they practice what they preach.

Beautiful planting and sculptures within a fantastic modern design and the architecture of the structures is fascinating.

Wear good walking shoes as there is a lot to see!

There is a shuttle train($3 ), to take you to the domes if you want to save your feet but it's only a 15 minute walk from the ticket office.

You must visit the highest indoor waterfall !

There is a restaurant serving variety of dishesfir lunch and also an informal cafe for simpler food and drink.

We had a great day here. I would say value for money as it kept us entertained for around 4 or 5 hours.

Good labels on the planting in the Flower Dome so would be great for avid gardeners and anyone with a general interest in art and the natural world.

Very sobering thoughts about the state if the environment but ends on a positive note giving advice on how we can change our behaviour to reduce the risks to the planet

Only the Flower Dome (air conditioned) and Cloud Forest (air conditioned) and OCBC Skyway (open air) is pay to enter. Do allocate minimum 1 hour for each dome as you need time to look at the plants, snap thousands of pictures, not forgetting the crowds as well. I spent approximately 3 hours for all 3 attractions and even skipped a few educational program offered in each dome, I visited during midday which the sun if most ferocious, thankful that this is an indoor air-conditioned garden, it certainly helped the scorching heat outside.

We are also lucky that the week we went have a garden of Tulips, colourful Tulips.

Re-entry is possible for each dome, just get the stamp on your hand while exiting, you can return anytime only on that day.

The OCBC Skyway, I would suggest a sunset time as there are light show I believe and it is not that hot compared to morning and midday.

Tourist can get their tickets at the airport booth that are selling, tickets purchase on-site are normal price, somewhat 30%-40% more expensive. Even online does sell these tickets and they are authorised such as travelrecommends.com and klook.com.

You need to purchase tickets to get inside the two domes, Flower Fantasy and the Skywalk. Purchase them online ahead of your visit to get good discounts and avoid the queues. If you can only afford to see one of the domes then I recommend you visit the Cloud Forest. The outside gardens are free. I spent five hours at the Gardens including a lunch break in the food hall. There are many places to eat. It is well set up. Be sure to give yourselves time to stroll around and take in the gardens. You could easily do two half days is you have the time.
Children are well catered for in the Children‚Äôs Garden. There is a fabulous adventure playground in amongst the bush so provides plenty of shade. Remember to take swimming togs and towel for the children to play in the kiddies fountains. Your children will thank you for it and you will appreciate happy children! Take water and snacks to keep everyone hydrated and happy.
Currently it is very hot and humid in Singapore so I recommend you go early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the midday sun and take an umbrella to keep you protected.

Ticket pricing is complicated but I recommend you get the ""bus"" return ticket included as well as entry to the flower dome, sky walk and rainforest. Staff were very grumpy and not helpful. It was extremely crowded (dangerously so) so you could not stop to take many photos or see the exhibits. All very rushed as you need to follow the crowds (there seems to be one way to walk around it's like Ikea on a weekend...hellish)
Would not return as I say maybe it's incredible when it's quiet but staff told us it never is quiet so don't waste your money. Take photos from outside it's just as impressive",03-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 23:10:51.471063

Get off at Bayfront MTR, and make your way via the underpass, when you get to the top of the stairs (yes there is an elevator) you are greeted by the ticket office - the park itself is free, but you need to pay for the skywalk and the indoor gardens (the Cloud and the flower garden). And do get them......but I would advise either through your hotel or something like Klook, you save like 25%.
The park is huge - get a map, I have been told it‚Äôs amazing at night, I went in the day (less mosquitos), you can get a shuttle ($3sg), or just walk.
I happened to walk on one of the most humid days so far in 2019, weather blows two extremes started the day torrential rain and thunder, when I left for the park sunny skies and 33c......but the water has to go somewhere!?!?
Sweating bullets all day.
The skywalk is okay, great views across the park, essential, maybe, maybe not......I thought ‚Äòmeh‚Äô.
I was impressed though with the 2 indoor gardens - might have been something to do with the strong AC (who knew Cactus liked AC!?) but I loved it......

It was a sight to see. Maybe the view was better if you took spot right under the trees, maybe on the hanging bridge it was better (but one cannot predict the exact time when your turn to climb the hanging bridge will come even if you bought ticket for 8:30pm time you will might end up on the bridge at around 9pm). so if you want to see the tree light show from the hanging bridge between trees, then learn the time of the show, get the ticket for bridge for 30 mins earlier.

These gardens are a wonder. The two domes - two different climates - are amazing. The drier one, the Mediterranean, had a cherry blossom display when we were there. The Japanese influence was beautiful and restful.
The second other dome contains a man made waterfall and wet climate plants. You need to be prepared for a walk to the top. It is well worth it.
The skywalk is not be be missed either and, lucky for us, we didn't have to wait long in the queue. The view towards the Marina Bay Hotel, with its spectacular pool on the roof, if fantastic!
The gardens are big, so take your time and allow enough time to see them in their entirety.

Firstly the extensive gardens themselves including Supergrove structures. Free entry, close to the MRT, stunning gardens, birdlife , fountains and water displays and an impressive array of sculptures.

Next the ""Flower Dome"" Entry fee applies. An enormous air cooled dome that at the time we visited had ranges of flowers, plants and amazing trees from all around the world separated into their regions. A special highlight at the time was the Flowering cheery blossoms from Japan including a Japanese cultural display and market. Another great feature were the incredible wooden sculptures interwoven with the plants and trees. Must see.

Next the ""Cloud forest"" an enormous construction within an air cooled dome that incorporates a full sized waterfall. You catch a lift to the top of the structure a wind your way down several times to the bottom on platforms. Wooden sculptures are also include in this eye catching display. Entry fee applies.

Finally you must return in the evening to catch the Gardens by the Bay light display that incorporates the the Supergrove structures in the gardens. A world class light display twice every evening which is a photographers delight.

I would recommend the itinerary below for tourists trying to get the essence of Singapore in less than 3 days.
First : Buy all tickets online and wear comfortable casual clothes and don't forget that selfie stick.
4-5pm - Singapore Flyer (I would recommend it for a complete experience of Singapore, but can choose to skip this)
15 min walk from Flyer to Gardens by the bay (lovely views)
5:30 - 8pm : GBTB (Flower dome, Cloud Forest and Super Tree Grove)
Get hold of a map, as this place is massive and you don't want to go in circles.
Take a stroll in the free gardens first eg.Chinese Garden, meadow before u step into both the Glass domes for which you need ur tickets. The Sky bridge also requires a ticket.
Cloud Forest - the tall dome with a Spidery waterfall and a rainforesty picture - few hollywood movies shot here.
Flower dome : Beautiful Orchids and regional flowers.Dont miss
7:45 - don't miss the musical show at the Super Tree Grove
8-9:30pm : Dinner at either Indochine (Supertree Grove) expensive or at any of the restaurants in Marina Bay Sands (MBS)
10 min walk from Gardens by the Bay to Marina Bay Sands
9:45 till as much time as u can afford : Marina Bay Sands
Will review MBS separately (quick highlights - Rooftop bar CeLavi for the views, Casino - a rich yet free experience and multiple luxury shopping options).
It's a shame if you are visiting Singapore and fly out without visiting GBTB and MBS. Happy Travelling...",03-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 23:12:50.105127
