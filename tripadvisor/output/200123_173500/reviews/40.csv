We started from the Marang Trail climbed up ladders to the Mount Fabor Park, a short walk then led to the Henderson Waves which looks like Dragon from some angles. View up there is the greenery down there all the way to the sea and Sentosa island.

Very easy to reach via cab from Vivo City or Harbourfront. No bus or public transport goes all the way upto the park. Cab is the best option. A short climb to the bridge and you are there. Walk, look at the view across of the Sentosa,water, high-rises, greenery all around. I went in the daylight but it looks beautiful when lights come on. Take time to sit, relax with loved ones. The walk to Mt Faber is long. Alternatively you can comedown a stairway onto the road. There is a bus stop right there which can take you to nearest bus depot and MRT.Cabs will be difficult to find.

The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worthy of visiting and walking across, taking in elevated views of Telok Blangah and beyond. That it connects with Mt Faber extends the walk to a visit to another of Singapore's favourite tourist destinations. Visitors can get marvellous city and harbour views from the top of Mt Faber as well as take the cable car across to Sentosa.
Henderson Waves is part of the walkways system in the Southern Ridges, 10km of greenery extending from Labrador Park to Kent Ridge Park, to Hortpark, to Telok Blangah Hill Park, to Mt Faber.

Started our walk at VivoCity Harbourfront MRT station. Follow signs to exit D, Marang Trail, a moderate to challenging 15 minute hike up to Mt Faber. Views are fantastic up there. On the hinterland you can see the city skyline and public housing. On the coastal front, you can see Sentosa and the various islands. Enjoy the scenery! Walk further and you’ll come to The Jewel, a restaurant, as well as Mt Faber cable car station. An easy walk along the footpath. Be careful of traffic. You will then come to a fork (which is actually a loop). Taking the left fork is 700m to Henderson Waves, while the right is 300m.
We took the longer route. Reaching a Danish Seamen Church, we turned right round the loop. Within a few steps, we came to the big sign ‘Henderson Waves’. A beautiful man-made bridge structure. It was very cooling and slightly breezy.
Continuing the walk, you will come to Forest Walk, a metal trail that brings you into the forest canopy. You come very close to nature here, hearing the various birds and insects, plus seeing squirrels. We ended our walk here and returned via the same route after 2.5 hrs. The trail continues further if you wish to walk more.

It is a wooden bridge at a height of 68 meters and has an unusual shape that gives the feeling of waves. Singapore is one of the rare cities where you can enjoy walking through a dense tropical forest right in the middle of the city. A 2.5 kms long tree top walk is one of my favourite activities during every trip to Singapore.
A hour long downpour in the morning had the desired cooling effect and we headed for this trek. It is a thoroughly enjoyable climb that takes you through a forest track and offers spectacular view of the city from the highest point at the Henderson Waves.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-23 17:35:24.448953

We went shopping in Vivocity and then took the cable car up to the Mount Faber station. You then just go down to the road behind the station and head left following the signs for the Henderson Waves. It is well sign posted and a 10 minute slow walk (about 450m). You have to turn right shortly and follow a meandering road downhill. Keep to the path on the right and you'll soon come to a very clear signed entrance to the bridge.
The kids loved running up the sloped sides on the wave sections of the bridge and we spend a good 30 minutes here. At the opposite end there is a path on the left that tales you down the hill through some exercise areas with sit-up tables, pull up bars etc. Eventually you come to a car park and from here we got an Uber cab back to our hotel.

The bridge offers beautiful scenes of greener Singapore uncovered by skyscrapers. I visited Henderson Waves at dusk and lots of locals (couples, families, groups of friends) were hanging out there.

The green foliage of the forest and park area had shielded virtually every man made structure around, some of the tall buildings managed to show themselves though,maybe trying to still score a point for balance.
At this early hour on a weekday, a solitude walk with no one around within a five km radius was exhilarating. The bridge is designed uniquely resembling seven waves rising up and down the deck.
The bridge was made to connect Mt.Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Park a few years ago, the walk is about 1/2 a km and feels like a board walk.

It had started to drizzle a little and I started to walk towards the Mt.Faber park.
From here I could take in a panaromic view of the city, the dense CBD and a rainforest that was slowly opening up through the haze.

The SMRT travel app will keep you right!). Secondly, it is situated at a high elevation and in an area of natural beauty, with terrific views of the park vegetation and wildlife, but also of some of the urban features of Singapore, such as the port. Finally, the Henderson Waves as a structure is pretty cool, with the waves incorporated into the wooden decking but also the bridge structure itself. If you are interested in architecture or civil engineering you will be interested in this! Benches are incorporated into the decking, so you can sit, enjoy the breeze and views.

The bridge and all around has cameras and it made me feel safe.
All the environment and atmosphere is just reenergising and fill us with peace and gratitude.
I didn' t do the full walk because it was to long for me, instead I took the bus 124 in a bus stop at Orchard Road and I asked the driver to let me out at the closest bus stop to the Henderson Waves. He was very friendly and showed me the steps I should go in order to get there. It was a steep step to get to the top, but the bridge was there!

From there I went for a walk in what they call Tree Top Walk.
That was the best experience for me. Not because of the beauty only but because of the feelings it brings. Imagine you walking above the top of the trees...
The bridge is totally safe and you can see under your feet the trees, relax with the birds singing and being surprise with the contrast view between the amazing nature and the city in the background!

For me to come back to Orchard Road and have all MRT stations I just got the bus 166.

(Not recommend for people suffering from vertigo. But there is a solution, just walk straight for 300 meters without looking down.)

View is awesome! Tall buildings side-by-side facing north, and greenery by Singapore Strait facing south.

Take your family here and allot half a day in order for you to enjoy the other attractions at the Southern Ridge. Spend bonding moments with your kids at Mt. Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park, 2 areas connected by Henderson Waves. This is a great way to enjoy nature in Singapore. I encountered a couple of squirrels by the road on the way to the bridge.

Some tips:

Reaching that place is not easy as there is no direct bus do you have to walk or take a cab which is surprising
Henderson wave is essentially a sky bridge over Henderson road uniquely done but that's about it. Walk to Fabre peak about 15 minutes and nothing great. Harbour with lot of ships actually is an eyesore
From Fabre peak harbour front MRT is good 15 minutes away

We took MRT, alight at Redhill and take bus 145 but we lost in the middle as we cannot find the exact point to alight from the bus.
*We were supposed to alight before Telok Blangah Heights
Asking to some local and extra walking, we finally find the stairways to the waves! (Yeay)
Our track is from Henderson Road, this track is not recommended for elderly or little children with difficulty to climb stairs.
The overall park is very big and nice but at that time we were short of energy supply.
