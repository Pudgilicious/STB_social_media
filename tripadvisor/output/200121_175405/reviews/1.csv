At night time with the light show everywhere you look is amazing and a real buzz around the gardens.

Great place to take the kids as they really enjoy the different lights and colours that are on show.

Personally I think it‚Äôs best to just stay in the free zone area and not go up to see views they are just ok.

I would make this a top priority to see while in Singapore and If time permits would go in daytime and nighttime to see the difference in atmosphere.",01-2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 17:54:22.127923

The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.

On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don‚Äôt do refunds üôÑ, sorry but that‚Äôs poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck. üò≥
So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....
Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 17:54:22.402646

The path are easy to follow and not overly crowded. There are signs identifying each tree or flower. The wood sculptures are unbelievable. The free light show far surpasses going to the Night Safari. The lights dance to the classical music. Get there early for a seat on the steps. Standing and looking up for close to an hour is not comfortable. Hang back or immediately head for the exits as it is very crowded as the area empties. Access to the park is easy from the Bayfront MRT.,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:54:23.298185

There are places to eat by the domes, but the better place is Satay by the Bay which has many hawker stalls and a large variety of food.

Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance.

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:54:32.223667

Floral fantasy a little further way from the centre but well worth the hike or shuttle. A small area with floral decorations and interpretations followed by the finale of a 4d film following the path of a dragonfly.....non moving seats on request for those of us with motion sickness

If you are planning to book tickets for the observatory I would advise two things, first, no need to get tickets for the skywalk as the observatory will be much better views and will suffice. Second, go to the observatory just before sunset, the views are breathtaking, the wind is refreshing, and you get to see the gardens transform with the amazing lighting they have. Don't miss the light and music show at 7:45 & 8:45 pm.",01-2020,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 17:55:07.797725

I say daytime because others who have visited the place say the nighttime light shows are even better. The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex. The flower dome is billed as the largest greenhouse in the world - large it is indeed, and nicely cool as well, and the geographically themed parts of the dome very nice. We preferred the cloud forest, another greenhouse with an artificial 35 m high waterfall - you can walk up on a spiral walkway from ground level to the top...",12-2019,,2020-01-21 17:55:17.774984

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The best part for kids is the children‚Äôs gardens where they can play with water in small fountains. Kids will enjoy to their fullest here.",09-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 17:55:18.586546

The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, ‚Äúit replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world‚Äù. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.
