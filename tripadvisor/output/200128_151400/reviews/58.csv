We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we’re back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:14:21.723306

Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:14:21.984114

#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.

Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren’t even half full.

The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.

The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.

You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.

I’d also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don’t want to fatigued when visiting.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:14:22.249776

The park closed at midnight so we couldn’t do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don’t recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it.

There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren’t willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don’t think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times.

Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don’t mind following trails and map guides.
The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.
All the animals were out and about.
A few pacing animals which were concerning.
Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.
The disappointment was that the show’s messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!
Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!

It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat.

Possible to do the safari on foot but with two tired kids, we waited almost an hour in the queue. Tip: go on the tram first and the night creature show after.
After having seen a few animal shows (birds of prey in Alsace France, China, Manila) I wasn’t impressed. It’s a very simple show but I won’t spoil the surprise.
The actual safari takes about 35 mins, there’s no wow factor. Getting to the zoo from downtown then queuing for so long zapped my energy. However for kids it’s ok. The souvenir shop is totally generic (I already had a few of the items). SG is expensive so the tickets were also expensive. There’s a short fire show that’s impressive just after the entrance.
Hope you will have a better time than we did. Regarding transport we took a grab to east park and it was 30$ vs the transport offered at 50$",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:14:54.448682

Staff in the night safari are for the most part grumpy, rude and combative. Could be a result of the kind of tourist they encounter BUT that's no excuse.

It's actually harder to spot animals compared to during the day if you see them at all and because of the lighting it's hards to see them even if you do.

Our son (4yrs) loves animals so we thought this would be a great family experience. We didnt buy tickets in advance which was a mistake, if you do go buy the tickets online, you will save yourself so much time and avoid the chaos.
Our son was excited all the way through the queue until he saw that the tram goes in the dark and he has a complete panic attack, refusing to sit on the tram. The park staff took us off and told us they would put us on the next one once my son had calmed down. But he still wouldn't. But one on the park employees - Damion was amazing, we are so grateful for how he helped us to try and calm down our son, and how he and all the other lovely employees really wanted our family to enjoy this experience.
They arranged for our family to have a private buggy, so our son wasn't overwhelmed by all the people on the tram and got to see all the animals he loves and we got to have a really cool experience! Especially seeing the elephants. They even arranged front row seats at the show, but our son was too tired by this point to cope sitting through a show.
We have so much gratitude for Damion, Femi, and the other staff who went above and beyond normal customer service.

Because of the haze in Malaysia and Singapore schools have been closed at various times over the last few weeks.

I spoke with Wildlife Reserves Singapore whose staff said that due to the exceptional circumstances it was happy for us to change our dates but that we had to do so via our agent Viator. Despite giving Viator the full facts, its staff said no!!!

The lesson from this is that just because Viator is a Trip Adviser Company, it does not prioritize its customers needs. It appears to be interested in nothing other than its booking fees, certainly not customer service! It is strange that when one searches for Singapore Night Safari on the Internet, Viator comes up first not WRS!

Well, night safari is not the right place to do that. At the entrace, we were greeted by lines of gift shops, and then restaurants (is this a mall or something?)
Then there’s this queue for the tram ride. We didn’t queue for a long time since I’ve read the review and so we arrived there 6.45pm (on Friday).
The tram ride is so so.. I feel like duration is too short, too many deer-like animals (my kids even said “why are we seeing deers again?”) and the tram’s length itself is too long so that the passangers at the rear end couldn’t even see anything!
After the tram ride ended, we went to see the night show.... which was also so so. Nothing impressing, animals appeared less than a minute (like they’re in rush or something). Owls appeared just once.... sorry, but super boring.
And that’s it. For 46SGD, tbh it’s not worth it.

Please go to the zoo instead.","I am aghast at the high ratings that the Night Safari receives. In my view it is a gimmick at best, and a travesty at worst. The first thing to understand is that every spot in the Night Safari experience has been designed as a bottleneck. That means that long queues start at the entrance to get in, in the first place, followed by those to get on to the tram, followed by those to watch the ""show"".

The tram rides are meant to suggest that we're going through a jungle at night. But the trams squeek and people make loud sounds of oohs and aahs. Overall, not bad, but dimly lit animals where we're straining to see them is really not my idea of any meaningful.

The show was stunningly bad - it starts out as some discotheque or teenage award show opening would - with strobe lighting, funky music and such - completely unclear why that needs to be the case. The animals come on stage, do their bit for a few seconds - and scurry away. I suppose Night Safari sells as a major highlight the fact that the owls come in on stands with their keepers down the aisles, i.e. near the audience members, and takes great pride in the python being brought up a the big surprise when we're all made to believe a mongoose is on the loose. Seriously?

I also find somewhat offensive the fact that a (extremely skillfully performed, admittedly) fire-twirling show is a highlight for the loooong winding queue at the entrance. I am sorry, what are you saying? That safaris are a feature in countries of Africa which can be cleverly represented by fire-twirling jugglers and acrobats? Oooh, lets set the mood to imagine if this were a safari in Kenya?! Cultural appropriation and stereotyping, anyone?

Very very serious advice: if you can do so, skip the tram and take the walking trails. Imagine going to a zoo and having to wear blindfolds? Can't? Neither can I, so please just skip Night Safari altogether and go to the zoo in the day.

The ONLY saving grace is the Ben and Jerry's ice cream stand outside.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:15:12.210737

Buy tickets online for sure if you do come otherwise -
Queue for tickets
Queue to get in
Queue for tram
Can quite easily be 20 mins / 30 mins / 45 mins and you haven’t seen a thing! Tram trip is ok, but you don’t see lots and over in about 25 mins. Queue takes longer than ride. You see more from walking the trails for sure. We did both. Entry tickets are staggered starting at 7.15pm / 8.15pm etc, big needs to change. Once you have entry the tram queue can be massive. If it is when you go don’t bother - walk it!
Can get there on MRT / bus from city but allow lots of time. Good 40 mins to park from MRT station and then time trip back to avoid missing last MRT (around 11.30pm / 11.45pm). Taxis can be difficult to get hold of at end as everybody leaves at same time

The tram lets you see all the animals as the walkways are not next to the roads but elsewhere.

Although purchased tickets on internet in advance, need to stand in a long queue to collect tickets. Be careful the ticket’s condition. Moreover, one counter staff rejected my ticket collect request although I waited for long time in a queue while aligning another staff’s indication after my consultation with him. Staff quality depends on each staff, but appreciate if the zoo encourage staffs.

There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm.
However, there are express pass as multi language tram ticket by S$10. When we have this pass, we can enter the zoo immediately even though I have later ticket. I recommend this way if you accept this cost.

<After Enter>
Honestly speaking, hard to see animals since they were hiding or lying on the ground and also darkness when I had been walking around the course.
But, I could see while I have been riding the tram.
My experience which I could see white lions was great for me.
We saw a animal shows, and there were cute animals, so we enjoyed.

We have been to Singapore Zoo before Night Safari. Singapore Zoo was soooo nice, thus we expected Night Safari is also so good as well. Unfortunately we were not so satisfied, but the zoo in the dark is rare experience.

I wish your experience will be nice!!",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:05.591811
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/sgsheep,697820841,11-08-2019,5,Tips to make Night Safari a good experience!,"We are regular visitors to the Singapore zoo - and we have in tow a 2.5 years old. We recently braved a visit to the Night Safari the first time (our last time there were when we were both kids - and we have not returned earlier as it is famous for its crowd). All three of us had a great time.

I was surprised myself.

1) *Find a way to get in the priority queue.* WRS members get priority. Elderly and folks with disabilities are also given priority. If you booked certain tours you are also given priority.

2) *Do NOT take the tram. Do the trails first.* You would have waited in LONG lines 2x (ticketing counter, the queue to enter the park even though there is a timing allocated) after you manage to clear the ticket gate. You will see another long line ahead (where 95% of people head to) for the tram. NO do not join that line. Look at your map - walk to the left and right and start the trails.

3) *Nocturnal animals are mostly SMALL animals.* The majority of the interesting exhibits are along the trails. You will never be able to see an owl or a porcupine on a moving tram 50m away from the little guy in a rainforest at night.

4) *Finding the animals is part of the fun.* This is a zoo, not a circus. Don't expect to easily spot all the animals listed on the map. The flying squirrels live on trees in tropical rainforests - finding something on a rainforest tree at night is definitely not easy. The hyena may decide to hide when you are there. Go with the right expectation and mindset - the keepers are around and they helped us find some animals.

5) *There are many interesting animals that are (as far as I can remember) not in the day zoo.* Things like the babirusa, bongo, hyena, tarsier, porcupine, civets, various cats, flying squirrels, cloud leopard - just to name a few.

6) *Do not leave when everyone is leaving.* We did not watch the show at the end of our visit - because we do not want to leave with the show crowd. There are plenty of cabs around and we managed to get one within 10min in line.

We didn't take the tram, we didn't watch the show - but we didn't feel like we missed anything and we loved it.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:05.855360
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/604lisan,696771559,08-08-2019,5,Amazing,"We opted to do the night safari tour with dinner. We booked through a Tour service and if you don’t want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows. Dress lightly as it is even more humid at the zoo than other areas of Singapore. A terrific experience.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:06.119233

We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:06.377928
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/WiseTreeOwl,695405062,04-08-2019,3,"A good zoo but over hyped, not worth the queuing.","Our expectations were very high for the Night Safari, we had been told by travel agents back home what a unique experience it was and many of the reviews on here really hype it up too.

We found the experience to be quite different in reality.

Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.

We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.

Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.

So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.

The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.

When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:06.636306

We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.

After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:07.154209

We were also unfortunate to have some tourists who didn't understand English sitting behind us who kept talking and talking. The ride was going through a dimly lit trail (I totally understand it as this is night safari). But at many spots we can't even see the animals when the guided announcement was talking about that animal. Bottomline is, I don't recommend this visit. They need many more improvements before it is acceptable attraction, like how to manage a more pleasant queue and waiting time, maybe installing some night vision screens in the tram and spread out the booking timing into 3-4 segments per hour so that all the visitors dont have to cramp in at the same time.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:13.558034

We did show then stood in the tram queue for an hour and still hadn’t got on. So decided to walk... but you don’t see everything on the walk so need to do both! When we got back the queues were smaller.

Nice to see Animals at night but this has a real zoo feeling and money making .. just mobbed with people.
the leopards are in a tiny area and we’re pacing back and forth and looked really sad. People were banging on windows and shouting loudly. But no staff around the trails to keep an eye out.

We did it as fast as we could in order to get the team ride in before we had to leave, however the queue was just as long an hour later. So, the walk was nice and we saw a few things but the tram was not possible. The animals at night show was cute, some clever animals there but far too much chatting and not enough animals/information (although what was there was, was good).

I’d say, don’t bother. Just do the zoo in the day, we saw so much more there and did not feel disappointed at all. Such a shame, the night safari is a great concept, but they let way too many people in causing chaos and huge queues, not my idea of a family night out.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:16:32.694354

A number of exhibits on the river safari were closed (all the walk through ones) and the giant pandas which were highly advertised were barely visible. We bought tickets to the amazon river cruise which upon arrival at the start of the ride (a one minute walk from the ticket counter) we were informed it would not go ahead due to the incoming storm. It seems pretty clear when selling the tickets a storm was imminent! We were then told we could not get a refund on the boat ride but could get a credit for the gift store. Upon complaining we were allowed to use it towards food. The river safari was largely fish in tanks with a few varieties of alligator and Turtles thrown in. The manatees were enjoyable.
We were booked on the 7.15pm Night Safari which also included a live show. We went through the gate at 7pm and were told the 7.15pm live show was now full but we could see the 8.15pm after our safari - all good. We then got ushered into an enormous queue which we stood in for 45min with our kids and elderly parents. We finally got into the tour at 7.45pm. The tour was 30min long and underwhelming. Upon finishing the safari we were told the 8.30pm live show was full and we could wait for the 9.30pm show. We could not wait around that long with 3 small kids.

We went back in at 8pm and just got a seat at the creatures of the night show as people had already been queuing and everyone coming off the earlier trans heads straight for the show. The show was ok but nothing great. We did some of the trails and the got the tram at 9ish. By this time there was no queue so if you can wait.

If you imagine Safari to be like Nepal or South Africa then just stop dreaming . It’s a zoo Maintained nicely for the inside tour in Tram to watch the animals having their food . The food timings are Maintained such that all the animals can be visible . The quantity of the animals is not huge . Some countable in small numbers each breed .
We had an iternary of Night Safari after checking out from the Universal Studio .

I would suggest ‘’ This is not at all Must Visit Place’’ Compared to Thailand Zoo this place needs lots of improvement .
You can visit if you have spare time in the evening . Otherwise no need to leave from the Universal Studio early in the evening .
Travel agents have convenient pickup and drop accordingly so they would set this iternary but it’s ok if not visited .
The light show in the beginning and the night life animals show in the last was nice to watch . Full marks to them .
One good thing ... they allow outside food with you .
Tram ride has all the time waiting of 30-40 minutes so keep patience . No need to hurry . All the times mostly same waiting is there .

Hope it’s helpful .

A must visit.
Good Place for all age groups.
Now when you plan the visit...remember that the place is always over subscribed. Be it tourist season or not.
So ensure that you do not plan this on a weekend including Friday.
Reach the location early if you have just booked the tickets and not a time slot . Its restaurants and surroundings open by 5:30 pm.
Be the early bird and book yourself a a entry in 7:00 pm show. Other shows are equally good....its just that if you go into the later shows...the public transport on your way back would not be available....although taxis are available all time.

In the park..
Make a foot trip first as most people will gather for the tram trail.
Then do the tram trail.
Now there is an exciting Animal show ... i think there are three shows on week ends and 2 on week days....8:30, 9:30 & 10:30 pm. Walking trail will take an hour and tram trail will take 45-50 mins.

The only disappointing factor was that we didn't realise there are really 3 parts to the Night Safari : A self walking tour, a show, as well as the little bus/tram that takes you around on a tour. We booked our tour time (as we were, & do recommend). We filled in time at the River Safari until the gates opened & then went & had dinner at the night safari (as all food outlets at the River Safari had closed by the time we finished) while we waited for our allocated time slot. What we didn't realise was - we could have been doing our walking tour during this time. Consequently, we wasted time having dinner, then did our bus tour at allocated time, went to show, then had to really rush around our walking tour before the park closed.

The tickets are not cheap, but neither is running a zoo, so it is understandable they want to cash in on their popular attractions.

The train ride itself was shorter than our time spent waiting in line to get on. During the ride, you see various animals that apparently don't need any sleep and are not bothered be the light or the sound of the train. But even if the light seems a bit bright, it is still not enough to take good photos from the train (crazy idea, I know). The fact that the train rarely stops doesn't help, either. Throughout the ride, we saw people walking nearby, perhaps on some guided night tour. These are a lot more expensive, but give you an actual opportunity to see something and take pictures, maybe using a tripod.

I can understand that in order to meet demand, they can not make the train rides longer. Letting people hop on/off also wouldn't work since they would just linger at the most popular spots like they do during daytime. At the end, a hurried train ride like this may be the best thing one can hope for, but that doesn't mean it's good.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:17:22.038069

The concept is truly unique. The night safari is next to the Singapore zoo and the tickets are be bought separately as well. WRS runs the Singapore zoo, jurong bird park, river safari and the night safari. U can buy combo tickets for all four or any two/three depending on time available and budget/ interest. We choose the night safari and river safari. The night safari starts at 7.15 , followed by a show at 8.15 till 12 midnight. The Singapore zoo is located away from the main Singapore and takes an hour each way to reach. We stood in line for the 7.15 show at around 6.30 and it was already crowded. The thumbuarkar fire show started at 7.pm( happens at 7,8 and 9 pm except Wednesday and at 10 pm on weekends) but we were unable to enjoy it standing in the queue. The safari is divided in two parts - the creatures of the night show and the English tram ride. We did the creatures of night show first. Had to wait in queues again and did the tram ride later. I suggest u do the tram ride first and go for the show later. There are 4 trails which u can do on foot. The tram is great experience with a commentary on all animals. They also spoke about their wildlife conservation efforts. We definitely learned the lot that day. It is a good idea to buy your tickets online as they are cheaper.

To each his/her own,some people may like the place as well,but just sitting in an open bus and looking at those highly trained animals who are standing there,just for visitors to have a look at them ,was not a very pleasing sight for me but again,it's different for different people.

Also,the first show starts at 7 pm,so reach their an hour early if you don't want to end up in a long queue.

There are a bundle of things to be done as long as you are prepared to stay late and explore on foot. To start with make sure you are there at the entrance at 6:45 for the Fire show - The fire show was amazing and is free to everyone even without a ticket

Now comes the confusing part. You need to buy a ticket for a specific time. Times available are 7:15, 8:15 etc. We purchased the 8:15 ticket thinking that is for the actual safari ride in the tram and planned to spend 7-8 attending the ""Creatures of the night show"". However, they have a ridiculous policy that they wont even allow you to enter until 8:15. After a lot of haggling, they did allow at 7:30, but we lost precious 30 minutes in this process.

Once inside, a tram takes you around the night safari area and you can see the night creatures (some were not to be seen) After the ride, there are night trails to walk around and you need a minimum of 1.5 hours to walk and explore the jungle night life which is very unique and a must do

The other highlight is the Creatures of the night show - there are some really interesting creatures to be seen and the seats are limited, so make sure that you queue before hand to see this 20 minute show.

Plan to spend around 4 hours (7-11pm). There are plenty of travel options back to Singapore and Grab worked very well for us.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:17:29.670925

We then walked the trails (there are 4 of them) and caught the Creatures of the Night show, which was great. The keepers walk through the crowd with some of the animals (like a binturong) but despite repeating that you are not allowed to touch the animals, some people did which was disappointing.
Whilst it was enjoyable, it was also very busy. We went on a Monday night thinking it would be quieter but it was still packed. We bought tickets via Duck Boat Tours as they included return bus tickets - this was a mistake. They give you only around 2.5 hours at the zoo which is no where near enough.

We saw pretty much all of the animals there. Unfortunately you can't really take photographs as its pretty dark and obviously you can't use flash. But we saw lots.

We also mamboed to get straight into the show with good seats. This was fun and we enjoyed seeing the animals on stage, though also pleased they weren't made to perform silly tricks, etc like some places.

The park itself is out of Singapore proper, but a Grabcar was only $18 to get there from downtown and a taxi back was about $25. $48 for park entrance seemed high. The park reminded me a little of a Disney park - very crowded, bad overpriced food and a bit hokey. It just seemed more like an amusement park than a wildlife or nature park. Included with admission was the Creatures of the Night Show. Lame. A good portion of the audience left half way through. I think there were 5 creatures that they managed to stretch out for what seemed like an hour. Simply overplayed, not particularly informative. The “audience interaction” was painful. Also included was a tram ride through the park. Again, my beef is that many of the animals are the same as you would see during the daytime. The problem is that , obviously it is dark, and many were out of site despite the also-painful canned narration that would describe them whether they were there or not. Most of the enclosures were lighted, so if you could see them, it was the same as viewing them in the daytime just a bit harder to make out. They were not active. You can also walk through the park which at least gives you adequate time at each enclosure, but again, nothing I would say that was extraordinary or noteworthy. At least there were not a lot of biting bugs. If you’ve never been to a zoo, or had little experience with nature parks, maybe this would be interesting for you.

Arriving at 7PM and long queues a head of us. We decided to watch the night-show first but we were informed 19.15 show was full.... come back for the 20.30 show was the message. We queued up for the tram ride for some 20-30 minutes, got on the ride and enjoyed it very much.
Very much worth the effort and we could even see most of the animals, great experience. What was less great was that when we returned to “station” some 8.10 PM we were told the 20.30 show was already full and we were asked to return 21.30! Really annoying to have ticket for 19.15 and still no guarantee to get into the show. Bad organised and planned by night safari!!!
There are also 5(?) different walks where you can see the animals by foot. This is a well worth to do. We did some of the walks and then we returned home to put our son to bed and therefore we missed the show and I cannot comment what it was about.

The lighting is very cleverly done and we saw animals that are nocturnal and that we have never seen out before in other zoos. It was simply amazing and as most people were queuing for the tram ride we had front row views of all of the animals.

We did then go on the tram - it goes through areas of the zoo that you cannot walk around so you see other animals.

We booked a 8.15pm entry, we got through gates at 8 and walked straight to the night show that was ready for 8.30, it was already crowded but we got space up the back and enjoyed the show. The lines for the trams were huge so we did all the walking trails first. The trails were great and it was fun seeing a lot of the animals. We headed back to the tram station for 10pm the lines were nothing and we had a relaxing informative trip around the safari. All the small kids had gone by then, so a good tip wait until later to do tram as it was chaotic earlier with young families. We enjoyed the tram and went on the final trip of the evening finishing up at 11.30pm ready to head out the gates straight into a taxi home. Fantastic evening out for young and old.

Probably our expectations were too high, particularly fueled by the price. At the end we had some fun, but it wasn't great.
On the day we visited, there were definitely too many people (entry at 8:15 pm). After the long queue the show was hard to follow from a corner seat.

Split queue of people who wants to take train vs people who wants to walk first.
Make pavement more reflective to light to ensure where we put our steps at all time to avood injuries. Put light at the pavement height instead of street type of lighting which create a lighting pollution and reduce night type of night safari experience.
Hand out brochures or inform people to keep their voice down and avoid shouting while visiting. Also explain to them in Singapore we walk on the left side instead of the right side.
Add signs like coloured lines of the section on the pavement to indicate direction and next station to visit. May be developed an Apps/QR code where people people can get and read information about animal ststion or zoo history and add/share pictures to it to zoo websites, social media.
Display QR codes related to each animal station in the train and encourage to use headphones to reduce noise pollution and handle devices to listen which let people to decide if they want to listen or enjoy quiet visit.

The night safari is a must do while you are in Singapore - there are a couple of ways to get there as it's not close to the city a) taxi b) HOP on Hop off bus has a route that heads to and from the zoo (but the times are limited)

We got a taxi from the CBD and the trip took about 30 minutes.

There are a few activities on offer on the night: 1. firedance show 2. meet some of the animals show 3. night safari ride 4. walking around the zoo on foot

We experienced all of them and our favourite was the night safari ride itself - there is a guide who commentates along the way as it is dark and the animals can be hard to see - obviously it's random luck if you see all the animals.

Walking around it was hot and humid and we left this as our last activity. There were a few queues at each activity but didn't have to wait for too long - but people seem to know to go from the performance straight to the bus line for the safari.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:18:31.292878

I especially love the animal show. Your animals, MC and zookeepers were hilarious and fun and kept us in suspense and laughter with their theatrics. I loved the open range. It was an experience seeing some of these animals close up and realise how big and curious they really were. And the hyenas, though scary, were fascinating. Brought the Lion King to life for me. It was unreal! I feel the need to have a special mention about the lions as well. I usually try to visit the Zoo at least once a year. However, this was my first visit to the Night Safari. Despite this, it is actually the first time that i've seen how majestic the male lion looked. Usually at the Zoo, the lionesses are in full view and seem to be more majestic than the male lion. Maybe cuz they were always sleeping? Haha, anyways, this was the first time that i actually witnessed a male lion sitting up at full attention and looking all majestic like in the documentaries that i watch. :-) Lovely! And the fake buffalo in their den is an excellent attempt to be as true to their natural ways as possible. It was an interesting and wonderful feature. Thank you.I visited with my family consisting of 4 adults and 3 senior citizens (i can only select the category below as Family with teens as there are no other choices), hence though we could not walk much, we enjoyed the tram ride. Just to note, the tram did squeak a bit too much at times that the noise overode the commentary.

This review covers the Night Safari only.

The night safari opens at 7:15 pm each evening and is open till midnight. It offers the visitor the choice of a tram ride through the park or a walk through the park. Be aware that you need to book your tram ride time slot in advance.

The tram ride is a good opening gambit as the ride quietly guides you past each of the enclosures with a slowdown or a stop at each to get a look at the animals, with the driver giving a running commentary about the animals, their behaviour and their habitat. There is dim lighting available at each location to enable you to see the animals but photography is pretty much a lost cause and flash photography is completely forbidden. That said there is always some dipstick who will attempt to “sneak” a flash photo in.

The tram ride does allow you to alight at a couple of intermediate stops to get a closer look at the animal enclosures adjacent to the tram stop. You can then try to join the next available tram or walk back.

The walk through the night safari takes you through distinct zones and allows you to see exhibits and enclosures you cannot see from the tram as well as take a closer look at the enclosures you can see from the tram. The Lion feeding is particularly good to watch.

The main tram station also has a wide selection of food and beverage options and as with the main zoo, the local cuisine is excellent.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:18:39.112456

Went on Sunday night. Used a Grab car from Chinatown for about $20. Booked tickets via Klook app. 7.15pm booked out. Went at 8.15pm.

Very crowded. My recommendation is to do a self-guided walk or watch a show first. Avoid the massive queue for the tram which we did first. Took about 1 hour waiting, so after the tram tour, our young kids were very tired, the shows were pretty much finished and we just got to stroll around a bit.

By 10pm the queue to the tram is very short.

It is very dark. You'll struggle with a smartphone to take any good pictures. Forget about it from the tram which is moving and rarely stops completely. You'll need an SLR, fast lens and a tripod as you walk around.

A long queue at 10.30pm for taxis. We made a poor choice and took the shuttle bus to the MRT station Khatib (last one leaves at 10.40pm). The trip to nearest MRT station is actually about 20 minutes by this bus, and we did not make it back to the city until 11.50pm. Suffice it to say kids exhausted. Should have just used taxi.

Definitely get absolute earliest tickets (7.15pm) if you have young kids and make tram trip last thing you do (after 9.30pm).",01-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:18:48.255260
