It is well-guided and the explanations are very clear and interesting, and there's a free paper gallery guide which sums up it all. My personal favourite was the ""Tang Wreckship"" part, first floor. Worth noting that in the ""Arabic Art"" section, there's a free children book about southeast asia.

,1,28,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/dheersanghi13,667511904,19-04-2019,5,Asian Civilisation Museum - The Raffles Exhibit and the Tang Shipwreck,"The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), located near Clarke Quay, is dedicated to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia and gives great insight into life before the 20th century. It highlights Singapore’s history as a port city and provides informative exhibits that will change your perspective of people, places, and processes. I did 2 different tours of the ACM. The first one was about Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and his time in Java, and the second was about the Tang Shipwreck.

Sir Stamford Raffles is known as the founder of Singapore. There are schools, roads, and various monuments named after him. But who was he really? According to our volunteer docent, “Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.” This tour gives a peek into the life of Raffles from different perspectives. It details his thoughts, feelings, and mindset through his collection of art. Most Singaporeans remember Raffles due to his brief 10-month stay in Singapore but in reality, he rose to prominence during his residence is Java, Indonesia. The story of this man has been interpreted and misinterpreted hundreds of times. This tour also described the great empires of Java and the intricate relationship between Britain and its colonies. Additionally, displayed at the museum are several collections of art, trinkets, masks, puppets, gamelan ensemble, and more by Raffles. As a Singaporean Resident, this tour gave me a new understanding of the man who is so cherished by locals and foreigners alike.

In 1998, a shipwreck discovered near Sumatra islands, south of Singapore, was found to contain a remarkable cargo of ceramics, gold and silver objects. The story started about 1100 years ago, during the time of the Tang dynasty in China. Trade was flourishing between China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The objects recovered show us the strong demand for rare objects, and the artistic skills possessed by craftsmen back then. This gallery, with its stunning artifacts and displays, tells a story of lost civilizations.

There were also some interesting quotes by the guides at the museum:
“Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.”

“The Tang Shipwreck helps us understand arguably the most important period of human history, the time of the trade.”",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:30:45.854175
,1,28,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/197gabes,650478223,06-02-2019,5,A place where history comes alive,"Housed in colonial style building, the place is a joy to visit. The admission fee is also reasonable considering how much the place has to offer.

All the exhibits are well curated, with plenty of space to move about. There are seats scattered around the different galleries to rest tired feet or for one to enjoy the display for a different perspective. The only downside is the layout of the place can take abit getting used to, but clear signage are scattered near entrance/exit to direct you around.

Be prepare to spend at least 2-3 hours to really appreciate what the place has to offer, get ready to lost yourself among the exhibits as each doorway will leads to more artifacts or surprises just waiting to be discovered. To complete to whole experiences do find out the timing for their guided tour, as the commentary from the guides are fantastic.

Since the place also houses 2 F&B outlets; Empress and Prive, there is no worries of not being able to find a place for a quick bite while visiting the place.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:30:46.224041

With young kids you need to keep a close watch so that they don't randomly decide to damage anything, but it's still worth a visit for them.

The building itself harks to modern Japanese minimalsm, so architecture buffs would enjoy this place. But inside is a treasure trove of some truly outstanding artifacts of Asian origin.

Each section has its own mini guide/catalogue to the items on display. The sections relate to ship wreck, religion, performing arts etc. The special exhibits were included in the very small entry fee.

My teen son enjoyed each display and spent three hours asking questions I'd never expect from him. He now has an interest in Buddhism and the role local culture has on shaping it.

The exhibits tell the story of Asian civilisation through the ages. In one gallery there is a story of a shipwreck. Other galleries have exhibits of jewellery, ceramic and porcelain pottery, art and calligraphy, depictions of various religious beliefs etc. All the exhibits are beautiful and are well documented.

The museum is a place of cultural education. I would recommend that you take a guided tour. There are many additional bits of information that the guide will give you.

At the end of your tour, you will welcome a visit to the cafe which sells a selection of hot and cold drinks and snacks. I would recommend a visit to the souvenir shop too.

The museum is open daily from 10am to 7pm - but on Fridays it closes at 9pm. Admission is free to Singapore citizens and permanent residents. Adult foreign visitors have to pay SGD8 - but if visiting on a Friday between 7pm and 9pm - the price is SGD4.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 05:30:54.749902

The most unexpected, and a very refreshing change, was an exhibit was titled ""Ghost Nets"". This was an exhibition meant to stir our curiosity but with a lovely modern flair - we saw sea creatures created from discarded fishing nets.

We walked around Clark Quay, walked on the pedestrian bridges, and went over to the Merlion. Because of the close proximity we were able to do all of this before the museum opened and took some very nice photos because it was not busy.

The museum itself was large, open, and well air conditioned. We followed the greeters directions and went up to the special exhibit on the top floor and worked our way down to the ground floor. At the time we went the exhibit was Christianity in Asia. This exhibit was vast and well done. It not only talked about the missionaries and their role in Asia but also talked about the blends of eastern and western religions across the region.
The regular exhibits were also interesting, especially the importance of colors of glaze and where the glaze kilns were located.
Lastly, we saw the exhibit about the ship that sank with all the bowls. It was very nicely done with the glass tubes and recovered bowls.

Plenty of nice bathrooms
Extra cost for the special exhibits, but it's all very well done and worth it.

The museum uses VR for its permanent exhibit on tang shipwrecks, which you either use the smartphone attached to view, or download the ACM VR app and attach to the available VR gear to watch. That engages the kids a fair bit.

Beyond that, the ACM app allows you to have personalised tour of the museum as you walk around. So it's not just reading the descriptions or looking at the exhibits alone.

The Christianity in Asia exhibition is wonderful. If you are a Christiab from a mainstream denomination, you will recognise many symbols and traditions put on display. If you are familiar with Asian cultures, you will also be familiar with some of the cultures depicted in these artefacts.

The museum is spacious and clean. Very good to spend a day there. Free for Singaporeans, except for the Christianity in Asia exhibition, which is $9 per adult (Singaporean).",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 05:31:48.740254

I'm writing a fresh review however because we went to the Raffles Exhibition recently and found that it hardly answered the questions about the colonialist's legacy! Instead, a lot more was said about the artefacts he brought back to the UK, as well as his time elsewhere in the region. The controversial questions surrounding him, including the ones used in the advertising material, were not addressed head-on.

No story through time, no focus on important events - just a huge collection of very old things.

With all the items on display, this museum has lots of potential, but doesn’t live up to it.

The suggested route takes you first to the star attraction of the museum - the Tang Shipwreck. If you're a fan of ceramics, this is for you. Perfectly preserved 9th century bowls, pots, water carriers, wine pitchers, silver boxes, gold wine cups, mirrors - incredible to think these items survived almost 1,200 years at the bottom of the ocean before being recovered in the late 1990s.

You then pass through rooms of items created for the European market, or created in Europe with an oriental style. On the upper floor is a fabulous display of religious artefacts -Buddhas, Temple Gods, Mosque tiles...

Brilliantly curated, with intelligent information provided for practically every exhibit, you emerge with a much clearer view about how much apparently different societies have in common, rather than how antipathetic their apparent divergences might have made them.

As a Singaporean Citizen, we have free entry for museums on public holidays. For entrance fees you can check the Singaporean National Heritage Board website for all the information on fees, which includes discounts if you bundle together tickets for other related museums. The museum is not really connected to other buildings via sheltered walkway so if the weather forecast says that there'll be rain that day, make sure you carry an umbrella (actually you should always carry an umbrella in Singapore, rain or shine).

There're a few ways to get here by public transport, but the most convenient by far is by train. Taking the train to Raffles Place or City Hall along with a short 5 - 10 min walk from the train station will get you here. If you walk from City Hall you'll most probably pass by the National Gallery which also is a great museum to take a look at, or walking from Raffles Place will take you along the Singapore River which is also nice on a sunny day. If you're lucky the walk from Raffles Place will take you past some Ice cream trolley uncles which serve delicious ice cream sandwiches.

The museum won't take you very long to walk through though, expect to spend about 2 - 3 hours max. at this place. Definitely will not take an entire day to look at all the exhibits.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 05:33:54.512117

There are a lot of objects on display in the other areas of the museum, including an interesting display of religious artefacts representing a variety of faiths.

The guide was an expert in Southeast Asian history so, she was capable of explaining even the very small (and most often neglected) details about this very exhibition. The only cons about this tour is that her accent is very French-ish so it’s quite a difficulty for those who is unaccustomed to such accent.

The coverage at the reduced quantity is probably a blessing in disguise -- if you had ever done the paintings galleries in the Art History Museum in Vienna (Kunsthistoriches Museum Wien) in full with 3-4 large paintings hung vertically up & down a palace-sized gallery, you may feel vertigo within half an hour of trying to look up & down each wall, even though it may have enough paintings (and Greco-Roman sculptures and Egyptian sarcophagi) to appreciate for 2-3 days. Perhaps too much.

Here, it's mostly sculptures and ceramics too -- so no need to look up & down a wall. It's still very colourful and full of various motifs to savour, though, particularly for the ceramics. There's a strong pan-Asian focus in the ceramics curating so that the exhibit tries to have pieces from kilns from across SE Asia and beyond. Certainly, the focus on spotting variations in the technology (e.g. cobalt to give a deep, eye-catching blue) and motifs (e.g. Turkish porcelain adding very local elements such as cypress trees to the sort of porcelain which Chinese craftsmen would have never seen -- because there were no cypresses in China) is a very in-your-face in technicolor way of showing the spread of technology and trade.

Fully air-conditioned. Adding a special exhibit on Joeson Korea starting late April. Due to the construction works, two open galleries are cut off from the rest.",04-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 05:36:37.373959

When I was there, the most interesting exhibition was the one devoted to the former slave of Magellan, Enrique de Malacca, who may or may not have been the first man to circumnavigate the globe. I learned a lot from the short video interviews, featuring various history experts and even history buffs like the filmmaker Kidlat Tahimik who made a movie about him (Memories of Overdevelopment). The exhibit featured what the Enrique may have worn, and even a detailed cargo list that Magellan made for his trip.

My only complaint would be the short film that they produced about him. It could have been a lot more inventively directed and much better acted. One wishes that they had shown the Kidlat Tahimik film instead.

Another highlight was the exhibition that featured the 9th century cargo found on the Tang shipwreck - mostly ceramic objects and a few gold pieces. I chanced upon the guided tour that had already started and the tour guide was extremely well informed about this exhibition. He provided insights on how the production of ceramic plates and objets d'art flourished in Vietnam and Thailand when the Ming dynasty halted its own production of china for a few decades.

This isn't a large museum and can be done probably at a leisurely pace in an hour and a half. Or if you work at nearby Raffles Place, you can probably complete your visit over two lunch time sessions.

The building has been beautifully restored and the galleries are nicely lit and spacious. On both my visits the museum wasn't very busy and you may find your alone in some of the gallery rooms. Better for a slow appreciation of the exhibits.

The highlights for me were the Tang shipwreck and the trade route galleries (in particular, the elaborately crafted Indian cabinets). There is also a a small low lit room on the ground floor dedicated to Chinese ceramics -it contains a delightful statue of a Chinese lady that is actually a water pitcher

The slightly larger Chinese ceramic collection on the third floor was pretty good too. The route to the third floor gallery does need to be better sign posted though.

A word on the museum cafe - the food needs much improvement. You are better off heading to the nearby Fullerton hotel cafe or the numerous cafe options at Raffles Place for a meal.

It flows less than 4km from its source near Fort Canning Hill to the sea, but has long been an important waterway. Themes draw from Singapore’s nature as a cosmopolitan, multicultural, multi religious poet and trading city.” It gives you a glimpse of how cultures merged and helps appreciate the complexity of the area.

Yes, there are certainly better and more extensive collections in other major world cities, but if you're in Singapore this is the place to go for some quiet contemplation away from the heat and humidity. There are a number of marvelous and unusual pieces here, especially of Buddhist art from the 2nd century on. If patrons want more detailed explanation and contextualization, they can read a book, I go to appreciate the art of religious expression not to get a history lesson.

Particularly noteworthy is the superb display of pieces from the Tang shipwreck, a world class synoptic installation of objects that gives the viewer insight into the extensive trade routes of the 9th century. It's truly breathtaking.

Other galleries are less inspired. Some offer a motley array of pieces of varied quality. Masterpieces are jumbled up with mediocre works which speak to a lack of proper curatorial editing. Space is also employed in a rather odd way and lighting too could use some help. Coherence and flow, both aesthetic and intellectual, are hallmarks of a great museum.

In addition to the permanent collection, there was one exhibition on Burma, and another on Maritime ports.

Starting on the ground floor, is a large collection of artefacts recovered from a vessel that sank of Java. It was discovered by fisherman in 1998. Much of the cargo is pottery, and while significant, is a little mundane to look at given the similarity of all the pieces. He just the end of the newly painted and that is obvious. There are more exciting works in the form of gold and silver, and the blue and white porcelain that has been recovered. It is thought that this was an Arab ship that was sailing from China to the Middle East. In the same room on the back wall are some very nice oil paintings of early Singapore and Macau and Guangzhou.

The trade routes are depicted in the next room and the opening of trade by sea in the Tang Dynasty. Many interesting artefacts on display.

There is a small display of Peranakan ceramics which are very colourful. A pair of gold bowls from around 830AD are probably the highlight of the display. Other works in silver are included.

The Burmese Exhibition has numerous works of art related to religion and culture. Divided by the Pegan and Rangoon eras. Nice pictures of the many pagodas.

Ports Exhibition is interesting and has many artefacts - my favourite being a diamond and gemstone Speer from India. Clothing, textiles and art are included. There is a section on Eurasian growth also.

A room is designated to Islamic art which is very interesting.

A nice museum to visit - about 3 to 4 hours is what it took me to go around - then a coffee stop before leaving.

If it's raining heavily getting to the entrance can be an issue. Nearest taxi drop off point is the Fullerton Hotel and a two minute walk across Cavanagh Bridge. At the of the bridge look right and you see the Dalhousie Obelisk and the steel balls - great for photography. Free wifi inside the museum. Short printed guides are available for each of the exhibitions as well as a handbook available at the museum shop.

But my particular interest when I visited was the Tang Shipwreck display.

In 1998 a shipwreck was discovered off Belitung Island in the Java Sea. It turned out to be a Tang Dynasty ship trading to the Middle East and contained more than 70,000 ceramics, plus gold and silver objects.

Many of the items were in a remarkable state of preservation and now form a breath-taking display in their own gallery at the Asian Cicilisations Museum.

For some reason when I fronted up to the ticketing counter I was told that admission today was free, so I did' argue and enjoyed my free visit.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:39:31.059551

The Tang Shipwreck was interesting - especially if you have any archeology background. The other exhibits were limited - I enjoy Buddhist and Hindu art, but the Religion exhibit here was very sparse and informational notes very basic. Likewise with Highlights from the Collection - items out of context , I prefer an exhibit that tells a story, traces a timeline, relates items to the culture, etc, not just shows the artifacts, no matter how unique.
