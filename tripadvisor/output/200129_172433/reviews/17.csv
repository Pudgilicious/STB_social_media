With young kids in tow I thought they would get bored quickly but the history and culture within the temple kept them engage for the 2 hours we wandered through the building.

If you are seeking a cultural experience that has both beauty and historical significance then this is a must see. It is a working temple and watching the faithful praying was very calming. I would certainly recommend this to people who are traveling through Singapore.",10-2019,Family,2020-01-29 23:54:30.537028

Gold is used throughout and makes the temple have a glow to it. When you visit, make sure to cover your shoulders and legs - this applies to women for sure. I was given a shawl to cover my shoulders as I had a tank dress on. It was amazing to see the hundred Buddha statues on the first floor. My son and I just stared for a second as our senses were a little overwhelmed. Then there’s an elevator to the fourth floor which is where the tooth is located. It is enshrined in an enclosure and close circuit television allows you to look at the tooth. Was informed no one other than the most senior of monks are allowed into the area. I don’t know if I believe the tooth belonged to Buddha but the temple itself is amazing to visit. Because we were with a tour we didn’t have time to properly wander in the temple but our brief visit still left an impression of wonder.

First, it is located at China Town. (Meaning you can bargain cheap souvenirs, and eat authentic Chinese food since you're already within the area).
Second, you can immerse yourself inti their culture, and learn some of their practices.
Finally, it is one of the attractions in China Town.

Things to bring/do/wear while inside the said temple:
●As far as I remember, pointed objects i.e. umbrellas, and the like are not around inside the temple.
●Picture taking is prohibited while an on-going feast/mass is being held.
●Wear dress, or long skirts, or pants if ever you plan in visiting the said place. Although, you can borrow a sarong (provided by them) which you can find before entering the said place.
●Follow their rules for a hassle-free visit.

During the time we visited the said Temple, an on-going mass/feast is being held. I must say that it was really amazing how focus all the attendees gathered during that time. You will see high respect for their Buddha.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-29 23:55:52.246748

Dress light, take an umbrella, a bottle of water and at least SGD$40. Cash. Singapore is hot and wet at times, and the cash you will need for lunch and souvenirs, and an ice cream sandwich if you find him.
We found this Temple mostly over rated. It is an impressive building architecturally speaking, but there were so many people, we struggled to get inside, then we really saw nothing from the inside that we couldn’t have seen from the front door. Forget about using their filthy toilet at the top of the stairs, with a line of people to the ground floor.
My tip is just walk past it and poke your head inside the front door (for free) on your way to China town. The Maxwell Hawker centre next door on Maxwell rd, is well worth a visit for a meal while you are there.",06-2018,Family,2020-01-29 23:55:52.614257

3rd Floor - Museum with a storyline of Buddha life and a gallery to show the different type of Buddha icons from all over the world.

What will greet you as you near the temple will be its remarkable architectural style that is reminiscent of Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan. The colour red (which often stands for auspiciousness within Chinese culture) also stands out. At the entrance, depending on which entrance you are at (Note: there are two), you will see Maitreya Buddha at the main entrance, and the Goddess of Mercy at the other entrance. This is a place where many tourists take photos for remembrance and one of the locations to get great photos. You can take the lift or the stairs to other floors of the temple to have a look. Other attractions on these floors include the exhibition of the Buddha tooth itself, as well as other Buddhist relics in the museum. There is also a rooftop garden where you can take photos as well. The staff and volunteers are very friendly and you can seek their kind assistance should you have any queries or questions about Buddhism and its culture. Have an enjoyable experience!

NOTE: Please note that in the event that you are not dressed appropriately (such as wearing shorts), you will be asked to cover yourself with a shawl that is available at the entrance. You can ask for assistance if you do not know how to use it.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-29 23:57:40.852529

Smaller but each one surrounded by 100 even smaller statues. Each larger Buddha statue is dedicated to one or two of the Chinese zodiac characters (rooster, dragon, pig, ox etc). All exquisitely painted and carved and flanked by two protective Chinese warriors. You walk through this room to a huge hall. At one end is a large Buddha plus other statues.

Note: Photography or filming of any device (including mobile phones) is strictly prohibited in the sacred relic chamber. Visitors are to abide in dressing modestly and avoid obscene appearance (gentlemen pickup your pants to the waist line at the entrance!! and ladies no very low cut tops or mini skirts please.)

You can't get close to the actual tooth, but the ornate, gold shrine that it's housed in is lavish and ground. Unfortunately, pictures can't be taken, so take it all in! They've also got a small rooftop garden that's upstairs that I found tranquil. The 2nd and 3rd floors are the museum, while the 1st floor houses many Buddhist statues and prayer worship is conducted.

And, if you're in the right mood, one for the soul as well. As well an opportunity to learn a bit about Mahayana Buddhism - Chinese style.

Six storeys.

Ground Floor.

100 Dragons Hall (main hall) dedicated to the Buddha of the Future, Maitreya. In the middle with two Boddhisatvas on either side.

You'll notice immediately that this Buddha is not in a typical Asian posture nor in traditional Buddha garb. Rather he's in what's known as the ""European"" posture, i.e., seated on a chair or throne and wearing royal not monkly clothes. Notice the crown. Waiting his time to come to preach the dharma.

Ornate decorations. The walls are flanked with small Buddha statues in a variety of mudra poses set amongst smaller Buddha statues. An imposing and peaceful ensemble.

If you come at the right time, the main hall may be filled with worshipers reciting a sutra. When we came it was the Great Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom Practice led by a row of monks and a hall almost filled with laypersons.

Behind the main hall is the Universal Wisdom Hall where there are statues/shrines for each of the 8 protector Buddhas and Bodhisatvas of the 12 zodiac signs. Some do more than one sign (year) Find your birth year animal and your protector.. And join worshipers in making an offering to your protector.

When we were here in April, the temple was holding a blessing for the 1000 armed Avalokiteshvara Zodia protector. It appears that each month they hold a blessing for the Protector of a different zodiac sign. So there was a double ceremony.

Dominating this hall is the statue of the six-handed Boddhisatva Cintamanicakra Avalokisteshvara holding the wish fulfilling jewel (cintamani). Devotees come to pray for fulfillment of a wish. Behind the Boddhisatva is the Chinese text of the Heart Sutra - which is associated with him/her.

Mezzanine

A variety of exhibits. Famous monks. Ancestor hall (more of a shrine). Shrine of South Seas Freedom Avalokisteshvara in feminine form - Guan Yin.

Second Floor

Dedicated to Manjushri - Boddhisatva of Wisdom as is fitting he's flanked by a reproduction of the entire Maha Prajna Paramita Sutra, specially made for BTRTS.

Third Floor

Relics of the Buddha Shakyamuni and a statue of Boddhisatva Samantabhadra (associated with meditation and practice of Buddhism). In the center on the hall/ relic display is one of the iconic Buddhist trinities - Buddha Shayaymuni in the center flanked by Boddhisatva Manjushri (on the right as you look at the statues) and the Boddhisatva Samantabhadra (on the left). The trinity represents the unity of wisdom, practice and meditation with and within the dharma.

Fourth Floor

The inner and outer chambers of the Buddha Tooth Relic. Richly decorated. No pictures allowed but there are some on the BTRTS website. The inner chamber is behind glass and reserved for monks only. There are places for meditation and prayer.

Roof

Dedicated to Tibetan influenced Buddhism. A garden and pavilions. Very large Tibetan style prayer wheel (Vairocana). Statues of the five Dhyani Buddhas. A pleasant oasis.

There's a lot to see here. We've been here more than 3 times and next time we're in Singapore will go back to see what we missed. Or what we didn't see in enough detail.

One tip.

Take a look at the BTRTS website for in depth descriptions of each floor before you go. That will greatly enrich your experience.

They also provide free tours: one in Mandarin and the other in English, but you need to register beforehand. Check out their website.",04-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 00:03:15.406156

There *is* an ornate hall, and it was full of people when we arrived so we didn't crowd in. If we wanted to though, there were scarves and wrap-skirts to cover up in case you're an insensitive jerk who doesn't know how to dress at a temple.
Then we took the elevator (YES the elevator) to the 4th floor to where the tooth-viewing room is (no dress code necessary). The room is ornate, and English plaques explain the temple and the tooth relic on display behind glass in a golden pagoda.
Then we went up the stairs to the rooftop garden, where you can spin a giant prayer wheel and enjoy the benches and the plants.
We took the stairs on the way down, and we should have taken the elevator because we came out on to the street instead of back in the main room where we started.

,1,17,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,646153750,16-01-2019,5,The Best Mahayana Temple in Southeast Asia,"I am not a great fan of Singapore’s Chinatown. However, the Buddha Tooth Temple IS impressive. It’s the best Mahayana Buddhist temple I’ve seen in Southeast Asia (its closest competitor, in Medan, is huge, but modern architecture). Although less than 50 years old, this temple can bear comparison with many of the historic temples you see in China itself. The architecture is based on northern Chinese temple architecture of the Tang Dynasty (1300 years ago, and chiefly known in the West for colourful Tang ceramic horses and camels, and the infamous Empress Wu).

The building’s huge exterior may be the #1 photo-op in Chinatown: it’s only competition is the temple interior (See Temple Facade photo). The main hall is dominated by a stunning golden Maitreya, flanked by two golden Bodhisattvas. A Maitreya is a “future Buddha” who is to re-enlighten the world during a dark age when mankind has lost all sense of dharma. Bodhisattvas are holy men or women who have attained extremely high levels of dharma, and are on the cusp of total enlightenment themselves, but refrain, in order to instruct and raise up humanity. Historically, numerous rebellions have swept over China in which the rebels stirred up support by claiming that a dark age was upon us, and the Maitreya was about to come. Taoists were welcome to participate on grounds that the current emperor had lost the mandate of Heaven. The concept is not entirely unlike extreme millennialism in Christianity, and the catastrophic Taiping rebellion actually combined all three religions. Blaming any of the three religions on the carnage is unfair (see Maitreya and Boddhisatvas photo, and Maitreya Closeup photos).

A gentler side of Buddhism can be seen on the opposite, northwestern half of the ground floor, where a multi-armed compassionate deity with beautiful pastel colours is flanked by guardian Tang Dynasty warriors. For lack of positive identification, I’ll call the god Avalokiteśvara (see Compassionate Deity photo). But it might be the Chinese goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin. My Buddhist Thai partner thinks the statue is of “Phra Kuan Im”: i.e. Princess Guan Yin. Could be either. They both often have multiple arms, allowing them to reach out in half a dozen different directions to assist people who pray for help; vastly increasing the number and scope of their benevolent responses. (Kyoto has a temple with 1,001 thousand-armed Kannons—Guan Yins—which works out to 1,001,000 compassionate interventions!)

With better timing, Nok and I could have easily determined who the multi-armed deity was. We were doing a two-week whistle-stop tour of four SE Asian countries with American friends who’d never been to the Far East. Due to that schedule, we weren’t in Singapore on a Saturday. If you WILL be in Singapore on a Saturday, you can join a free two-hour English-language guided tour of the complete complex. You have to apply in advance to the temple, on-line. If you’re unfamiliar with Buddhism, I recommend you try to get into one of these free tours. And if you do, please do me a favour: ask your guide which benevolent deity this one actually is, and mention that in your TA review!

Definitely go upstairs as well. There are two museums aloft, and one relic chamber. The more interesting museum to me (and probably to you) is the Buddhist Culture Museum, which holds Buddhist artifacts from throughout Asia. Their collection of these artifacts is not as good as that of the Museum of Asian Art in San Francisco, where Asian history and culture are traced for 2500 years via Buddhist statues and images. But there’s a huge difference: in SF’s MAA, the curators and most visitors take a decidedly secular perspective of these statues—just as folks seeing the Venus de Milo don’t actually worship Greek goddesses. Here, the BCM’s emphasis is very much on the religious meaning and significance of the pieces in their collection.

The other museum tells the history of the construction of the temple itself. I understand why Singaporeans might find this interesting, just as New Yorkers might find details of the Brooklyn Bridge’s construction interesting, but I’d recommend giving it five minutes at most.

Finally, there’s the relic chamber. The most important relic here is a tooth of the Buddha. Many major Buddhist sites contain relic hairs from the Buddha, but there are far fewer teeth, so tooth relics are much rarer. This one is said to have been recovered from a ruined chedi in Burma, which I don’t doubt, but I am astonished that they got it out of the country. Such a relic, which radiates spiritual energy, would normally ensure that the holy site was rebuilt, and the Burmese go to great pains to do this at many chedis (I’ve reviewed at least half dozen of them for TA). Note that while the Buddha Tooth Temple itself is open from 0700 to 1900, the BCM and relic chamber are only open from 0900 to 1800.

Let me mention three behavioral policies here:

First, non-flash-photos are permitted in some places, but not in the relic chamber. Flash photos are strictly prohibited, as they should be, considering the damage they can do.

Second, shoes are permitted. Oddly enough, wearing shoes has been perfectly OK at every Mahayana temple I’ve ever visited in China, Japan and Tibet, but is strictly prohibited at every Theravada temple I’ve ever been to in Southeast Asia (as well as Hindu temples, Sikh gurdwaras and Moslem mosques). I suspect this has to do with the winter climate in Mahayana lands.

Third, dress appropriately for a place of worship! For men: no shorts or tank-tops. For women: conservative dress or slacks, with shoulders covered. I’ve railed about this in more than one TA review: my rogues’ gallery favourites are (#2) the drop-dead gorgeous Chinese lass in a miniskirt and spike heels, walking right past a multi-language dress code sign into a venerable wat in Chiang Mai, and (#1) the very busty Western lass jogging bra-less in a super-skimpy running outfit through a rigorous retreat in rural Thailand where young Buddhist monks are sent to spend months in speechless solitude, silently concentrating on nothing but the dharma arts and—oh yes—that hot babe that just ran past my hut, totally ruining eight weeks of meditation!

One last tip: as one of many examples of Singapore’s multi-culturalism, the Buddha Tooth Temple is literally one long block away from the most historic Hindu temple in Singapore, Sri Mariamman. I recommend seeing them both, one right after the other in either order. (There’s also a mosque right past Sri Mariamman, but the must-see one in Singapore is the Sultan Mosque over in Kampong Glam.)",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 00:03:51.081690

It's also a very impressive place inside and depending on your level of interest you can spent from 2 hours to 15 minutes. Some tips to enjoy your visit:

1. Dress appropriately. In other words, cover up…not short shorts, minis, bare backs, bare shoulders, etc. If you aren't properly dressed they won't admit you, however, if you have a problem there's a market right outside where you can buy a souvenir wrap, skirt, shawl, etc. that will also be a nice souvenir. There are some places where you need to remove your shoes. Staff are there to monitor things and let you know where this is required.

2. Start at the top. There are gardens at the top level and inside the Ten Thousand Buddhas Pavilion is a huge cloisonné enamel prayer wheel. Also on the upper floors are the Sacred Light Hall and the Inner and Outer Chamber where the Sacred Buddha Tooth is housed in an elegant surrounding. The ceiling is lit with Tang-style lanterns.

3. If your visit coincides with chanting in the main temple area on the ground floor, take some time to just walk slowly around the outer perimeter and absorb the atmosphere and the chanting. Going up to the mezzanine also provides a good view of the main area and an opportunity to take in all the lush décor.

4. They sell offerings and souvenirs, incense, etc. all on the pricey side, but there is a lot of work involved in maintaining this temple, so it's worth supporting.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 00:06:14.754697

You are less than nothing! Let me crush you with all the money we have extracted out of people! Die now, DIE!!!""

And when my missus told me we were coming to Chinatown and this was one of the attractions I hesitated but decided to give it a go. Upon your arrival, you will notice there are two entrances, one considered the front with a huge Buddha and a gazillion little Buddhas on its walls and the back that is a lot more modest and most people go there first; so we did.

The colours of the temple (almost all red and gold) give you an interesting composition difficult to photograph because of the poor light. Nevertheless, the second entrance wasn't that much on your face and I felt I wanted to move a little bit deeper into the temple, taking photos and contemplating the noisy silence in it. (Noisy silence is that silence that you got to have but it comes out of a constant whispering that accumulates enough to be part of your white background...)

At this point, you notice all the little Buddha are numbered and if you read carefully, you will read it has a ridiculous amount of it. You might not be able to imagine how many... but we are talking about statues about 12 centimetres (4 inches) tall in a box... covering every single wall from top to bottom and the walls are about 5 or 5 1/2 metres tall... maybe taller than that.

If you walk towards the main entrance, you will find to your right the entrance to the museum which tells you about the religion, relics, gives you access to some gardens and other little things. If you are already here, you better check out the museum as it is interesting.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 00:06:26.277535

The ground floor rooms are large and well appointed with wonderfully rich, multi-story Buddha statues as well as study tables for monks as well.

Donations are voluntary but with the security, loving care of the monks, air conditioning, and the right to burn incense and request an invocation, this is a very small price to pay.

Make sure to visit the upper fooors. Most tourists do not seem to be aware of the option to do so. The reliquary is absolutely beautiful and meditation by visitors is allowed. There are also roof gardens, prayer wheels, a small museum with various Buddhist artifact displays and some background on Buddhist deities and non deity personalities, as well as some history about Singapore.

The whole site is well maintained an appointed. A full review of the site could take 45 minutes if you move quickly or a bit longer if you linger as we did in the reliquary.

Signs ""not to take photos"" while at this site were,posted. A ceremony was on-going when we got there. Chanting and drums echoed the place. Security were around making sure you re not using your camera while the ceremony is at session. On the side of the building is the elevator and stairs. You can sit on the mezzanine balcony to observe the ceremony or you can proceed to the third level where they have a museum. Different sculptures of Buddhas are displayed. Not much of the prehistoric so era but somewhat historical years were displayed. You can take pictures here without the flash. The fourth level is the sacred museum where the actual Buddha's relics are displayed. Photos are not allowed here. You can view and read the historical anecdote on the displays. The fifth floor is the garden and the bell. So solemn and peaceful. It is a nice place to reflect and meditate. The round bell can be rotated while you pray. You are recommended to go around 4 times, representing the polar directions. Each direction has a bell. Such a powerful experience.

It was actually recently constructed in the last decade, with its opening in 2007. The name is based on the presence of an apparent ‘Buddha tooth relic’ which is located on the 4th floor of the temple – although it is only viewed behind glass. Shoulders are to be covered but appropriate shawls are provided at the entrance.

I visited this temple mainly to add weight to my visit to Chinatown but I am not of the faith. On the positive side it is free to enter (donations encouraged) but if you are not Buddhist you will likely not appreciate the museum aspect of the visit or most of the relics on display. It is a nice structure but I couldn’t get over the feeling I was just wandering through someone else’s place of worship and I didn’t find it too exciting. The temple certainly has brought into the commercialism of tourist dollars, with some small market stalls within the temple and various gimic donations encouraged.

It was free to enter but we would have happily paid to visit. The interior is a riot of colour, with a preponderance of red and gold forming the background to the numerous stations of worship. An internal separate seated area allows worship for parishioners whilst visitors walk around, taking photographs on the outskirts of the building. The temple is beautiful, and the kaleidoscope of colour makes for some excellent photo opportunities. The roof garden is worth seeing to see and spin the world's largest Buddhist prayer wheel. My discomfort was when seeing the Buddhist visitors trying to pay their respects in prayer before a particular statue of worship whilst some unthinking visitors jostle for positions to take group photos in front of sacred statues. Perhaps a modicum of consideration for those for whom the temple is a place of worship would improve the situation for all. You will love it.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 00:09:22.437170

Upon entering the temple we lit incense sticks and said a prayer. We then found ourselves in a room with astrological dieties along the perimeter and large statues of deities in the front. On each side of these large statues were 2 beautiful lotus screen paintings. There were candle offerings and people were praying. We then walked into the 2nd room after looking up our astrological deity, which was interesting to read about.

The 2nd large room off of the first was very beautiful and had many intricate sculptures in the walls, and the sculptural deities in the front on a dias were spectacular.

We then took the elevator up to each floor. ON the 2nd floor, were many artifacts, quite old, of various deities. The 3rd floor had more of this type of thing, old and valuable, and this is where the real relics are located, at the back. No photography of relics. You enter the room (shoes still on at this point) and you can view beautiful glass and gold vessels which hold different parts of the crystalized remains of the Buddha. There were blood, intestines, liver, etc. It was very extraordinary. I have never seen anything like this.

ON the 4th floor, you remove your shoes. You then enter a carpeted temple area. We heard the monks singing. There was a big gold screen which lowered down and behind this was the actual tooth relic. We just missed seeing it, but they have a photo on display. No photos allowed. The room was beautiful and the monks were singing because a monk was leaving so they closed this temple area at 5:30 instead of 6.

On the roof was a beautiful garden, and then in a structure, a large prayer wheel. All in all, this was a beautiful experience.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 00:09:52.552563

My suggestion would be to take the lifts all the way to the rooftop, enjoy and rest at the garden before slowly making your way down each floor to appreciate the Buddhist culture in Singapore.

There is a Meditation Area, another floor is dedicated to the history of the temple and lastly at the ground floor is the Prayer Hall.

We took the lift to the 4th level and the security guard asked my lady friend to put on a sarong.

However, she decided not to go up anymore so I proceeded to put the sarong away. The security guard requested me to fold back the sarong first, which was fine. So I began to fold the sarong back into its original position.

Then the security guard proceeds to criticize me in a condescending matter, saying I'm not folding it the right way and asks me if I've gone through national service. Mind you, I'm a 28 year old American tourist, so I tell him I didn't go through national service because I'm not Singaporean. He continues his criticism, saying that if I were in national service, I would be dead meat (for not properly folding a sarong).

Now, I found this language very condescending and uncalled for, and as a visitor and tourist, was taken aback by such behavior. I did not feel welcomed at all, and left in a sour mood. I hope that management can take measures to address such behavior, or at the very least provide more training to staff to have a more welcoming attitude to guests and mind their words, so as not to offend future visitors.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 00:11:14.206858

The temple was busy with devotees and tourists, much like the rest of Chinatown. Surprisingly it is a relatively new temple and was only built in 2007. The main entrance is on South Bridge Road where you walk through three large, heavy, red lacquered doors into a small courtyard, with a bell tower and drum tower on either side. From there you enter in the main hall, which is surrounded by hundreds of small Buddha statues, each with different mudras (hand signs) and holding different Buddhist implements or accessories. Above the Buddha statues are one hundred heavenly dragons, providing protection and vitality to all who worship in the hall. Behind the main hall is the Universal Wisdom hall, dominated by a statue of Buddha seated on a lotus flower, make sure you check out the zodiac protectors on the walls surrounding the hall. The mezzanine floor allows you to view down onto the main hall, though the surrounding walls have life sized waxworks of eminent sanghas.
It is however more than just a temple take the lift up to the fourth floor to view the Buddha tooth relic. It is reportedly the left canine tooth recovered from Buddhas funeral pyre and discovered in the remains of a collapsed stupa in Myanmar (Burma), having visited the Temple of the Tooth in Kandy, Sri Lanka, I was a bit dubious about its authenticity. The dazzlingly ornate 2.0m high solid gold stupa in which the tooth relic resides is impressive. No photos however are allowed inside the Sacred Light Hall. Then there's the museum on the third floor, with its relic chamber at the rear containing samples of Buddha's skin, blood, hair and large intestine (I kid you not).
Make sure you also visit the serene rooftop garden, far above the madding crowds. In the centre of this oasis is a pagoda housing a huge prayer wheel.
The temple is open from 7am to 7pm and is free. Just make sure that you are respectfully dressed and behaved as this is a place of worship and veneration.",11-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 00:11:48.280313

We entered from the Chinatown side, and enjoyed the first room as the miniature statue and tablet museum. Upon exiting this room, an official asked my partner (wearing elbow length sleeves and a knee length skirt) to cover her arms, passing her a shawl; yet he said the test of our attire was inoffensive and therefore apparently unlikely to cause any of the monks inside the temple to become enraged with desire, which would of course have been our fault.

The second room, with its thousands of miniature Buddha statues, was actually slightly underwhelming. Compared to similar temples in Hong Kong, this one seemed slightly artificial especially given that every statue was identical. The signposting stopped entirely after the first museum room, but the two shrine rooms were still rather beautiful to look at even if no information was given.

That was, however, until we reached the end of the main shrine and another official approached us. Apparently, my partner's knee length skirt was too racy for the inanimate Buddha statue, and we were asked to leave - no offering of shawl given on this end. As we thought we had reached the end, we did not complain.

There are several floors which have a number of rooms which offer a great variety of artwork, sculptures and many other historical artifacts and items. One of my favorite rooms was the one that had the large well made placard walls that described the life of Buddha.

The top of the temple cannot be skipped. It has nice gardens and one of those large Buddhist bell devices. There are enough items in this place that you could have enough photo opportunities that would last a full day or two.

There is a gift shop near the entrance set on the China Town side. You may see some monks. As a matter of fact I could have sworn I had seen a few interspersed between life sized statues on the second level.",07-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 00:14:10.862856

In the morning they have their service going on so you can watch from the sidelines if you want to. They also have coverings/shawls for you to cover up with if you aren't wearing long sleeves and long pants so that you can enter.
You can light an incense stick and pray at both entrances of the temple.

It houses the tooth relic of the Buddha. The relic can be viewed at the 4th floor of the temple from the public viewing area, as only monks are allowed into the relic chamber. The Buddha Tooth Relic is housed in a giant stupa that is made from 320 kilograms of gold. Beside the tooth relic of the Buddha you can visit the richly designed interiors and wide-ranging exhibits on Buddhist art and history. Some of the interesting parts of the building include the Hundred Dragons Hall, which houses a hundred Buddha statues, and the Universal Wisdom Hall, where handcrafted Bodhisattva artworks are on display. Head to the roof garden which has pagoda and Buddha prayer wheel for a tranquil hideaway.
Admission and the guided tour (2 hours) are free but donations are encouraged. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is opened Sun – Sat 7:00am - 7:00pm. Suggested duration is about an hour if doing a self-guided tour. Shoulders, back and legs should be covered to enter the temple to show respect.",02-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 00:16:10.620133

On the ground floor was a large altar and hundreds of Buddha statues in all sizes on each side of it. That day a large number of people were attending some formal function so we could not approach the altar.

In the back was another altar and it was more approachable. In front were a large number of offerings which included bottles of water, fruit or flowers. The water was unusual.

I then took the elevator to the top floor and climbed another set of stairs to the rooftop. I was surprised I see it filled with plants and trees. It was a beautiful garden! In the Center was a small building that housed the largest cloisonné prayer wheel in the world. It was called the Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel and inside it was a piece of scripture. I originally spun it the wrong way but a kind gentleman showed me that spinning it clockwise rang a bell after each complete turn and it helped a person with reciting the sutra.

I walked back down the stairs just as the shrine holding Buddha’s tooth opened. That was 9am which is 2 hours later than the opening time for the main temple. I had to remove my shoes before entering and they were quite strict going after people who forgot. No photos were allowed. Prayer and meditation areas were arrayed around the the glass wall that separated us from the gold plated tooth. They spared no expense in gold plating the room.

The last floor I visited contained the museum. They did a wonderful job of telling the story of Buddha through artifacts and words. Definitely spend time here if you have the time.",03-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 00:16:10.980787

We toured the ground floor for a good twenty minutes before deciding to explore upstairs. Each level offers something different, including the largest prayer wheel I have seen. One floor is set up as a typical museum with displays behind glass. The works here I found to be fascinating. There were ornate brass bells collected from all over Asia...a pair from Cambodia, a set from Thailand, and so forth. There were delicate wooden carvings colorfully painted on display. If they had not told me they were wood, I would not have known. In some cases they had the appearance of ceramic. All in all, a very interesting visit. The tooth of Buddha cannot be seen closely, but an enlarged photo of the tooth is on display.

Go up to the roof to see the large Tibetan Prayer Wheel and a great view. Didn’t get a chance to but the basement is supposed to served wonderful vegetarian food.

It's a temple first and a museum second, so proper attire is required: take your hat off, cover your legs and shoulders with free of cost provided aprons and scarfs.

The main floor is reserved for ceremonies, you certainly can enter, but the access might be limited during services, just like anywhere in the world. If you are lucky and visit during the prayers, it's very spiritual and mesmerizing to hear the Buddhist chants, even without understanding words, the singing sounds are very soothing and relaxing, even to a non-Buddhist.

There three more floors above, with various exhibits of Buddhists statues, and all religious paraphernalia. The 4th floor, is the one where the Buddha tooth relic is housed. Here any photography is strictly prohibited, as well as on the main floor during religious services, out of respect to the believers. On all the other floors, non-flash photos are fine. You can even get up all the way onto the top of the temple and see a big prayer wheel. Go turn it, clockwise only, please, and say a prayer, or a wish, if you want.

Before you leave, don't forget to return the borrowed apron and watch out for staircase exits as you might find yourself outside the temple right on the street;)

This review is meant for foreign travelers/visitors.

I may be wrong, but this temple appears to be of the Mahayana tradition.
Male and Female visitors are to note that you may need to dress (cover up) to prevent revealing of knees upwards and ladies need to cover up, if you are wearing slightly revealing tops like tank tops, singlets, sleeveless.
But not to worry, as there are some donated tops and bottoms that you can borrow at the two entrances, if you wish to enter the temple.
(Loan of the tops and bottoms are free of charge).

There is a Museum at the 3rd level (fully air-conditioned) where you can look at donated/loaned statues of Buddhas/Guan Yin, as well as sacred relics.
There is English, Chinese explanations of the exhibits.
A slow and detailed view of all the items will take about 1 hour to 1.5hours.

There is also a cafe serving VEGETARIAN diet at level B1 of this temple.
The entrances are on both sides of the temple (you need to walk about 15 steps down) or you can take the lift to level B1.
But do take note that the cafe closes at around 3pm everyday.
The items are served in fixed prices of about $3 or $4, depending on what items you choose.
Different menu items and soups are served everyday also.
Coarse rice usually runs out by early afternoon.
Do note that you need to CLEAR YOUR OWN TRAY and put them back at the the cafe.

Level 4 is the meditation room (fully air-conditioned) where the relics of Buddha is displayed. Do note that they have a daily routine where they may close it for maintenance and prayers (for about 15 mins).
The routine is around 12pm or 1pm.
In the meditation room, you can sit down and do your meditation (or chant your mantra/prayers quietly) but you are not allowed to sleep there.
(The security guard will ask you to leave if you sleep there).

TIP: The ""SECRET"" for this temple, which is also a MUST-SEE feature, is at the ROOFTOP garden.
Go to level 4 (the meditation room), look to your left for the stairs, then walk up 2 flight of stairs to reach the ROOF GARDEN.
Buddhists are recommended to pay your respects to the Buddhas at each of the four corners first.
The main feature is a GIANT PRAYER WHEEL in the centre.
I think the sanskirt/tibetan words read ""OM MANI PADME HUM"", the Mantra of Guan Yin.
Take your time to spin the prayer wheel in clockwise direction 7 rounds.
You exit via the stairs you came up from.

Visitors to take note that access to the level 4 meditation room and rooftop may be closed after 5pm!
The temple itself closes at about 7pm.",05-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 00:18:19.830095

The outside is pretty but when you step inside, it's gorgeous. So much to see and take in, I've never experienced anything like it before - or since!

Make sure you read the website to make sure you're dressed properly. Women have to have their arms covered and they provide scarves (no cost to you) to do this but I don't think some dresses are acceptable. There was a prayer service going on when I arrived in the middle of the room but the outside was open for you to walk around quietly. The room is surrounded with 100 different Buddhas along the wall, each one so ornate and pretty.

One of the upper levels required you to take off your shoes before entering and you had to be silent in the room. Something to keep in mind if you have little children with you. The top level was a garden and had a prayer wheel where you walk around it and spin it. Again, nothing I ever experienced before and I loved every aspect of this Temple.

I took so many photos that it was hard for me to select just a few for this review, so I uploaded a bunch. :)

You can visit it any time of the year but during major Buddhist or Chinese festival, the temple is decorated in bright colour and ornaments (like the one from Chinese New Year I've enclosed).

At the top of the temple is a roof garden with a large prayer wheel which you can turn.

On the fourth and third floors are artifacts of Buddhist faith for viewing and sometime attendant monks would offering blessings to worshippers.

Clean, vibrant, lots to see and experience. Many worshipers there and loads of tourists. Also, just two blocks from Maxwell Street Hawker center. Free admission.

Make sure to see the whole place, there are two entrances with very different appearances, both worth some photos. Also, in the main room, the altar is quite stunning.

The place is also worth walking around completely on the outside, there are some great photo ops from outside and from across the street too.

This is a new complex completed in 2007, ten years ago, so it is really modern in and of itself, and surely when contrasted with the old places nearby. The building has places for prayers of course, places to meditate, a theater, museum gift shop and even a tea house. Also checkout the peaceful rooftop garden of this five story building.

I was glad I had checked on Tripadviser because I would have missed the actual tooth relic, assuming it was in the main body of the temple, which it was not, it was upstairs and you need to take a lift upstairs. The top floor is the prayer wheel in a small garden - lovely.

This temple in Singapore we realized had been recently built, which was a surprise if not a disappointment. I hope not to offend, but it seemed excessively touristy. Buddhist monks performed a ceremony while we were there. It is certainly a photo opp. I have beautiful shots. There were slots to donate coins everywhere which were offered to specific ""buddhas"".

I had passed this place more times than I can remember. Was really surprised by how much there is to see.

The ground floor is a place of worship though it has obviously been designed to accommodate tourists. Now take note that the tooth relic itself is not on the ground floor.

I highly recommend you use the lift to visit the museum upstairs, yes there is a museum! It has historical pieces from across Asia and uses them to tell the story of Buddha and a digital screen will also tell you about every single piece. If you have a genuine interest in learning about the history around Buddha then this is a must!

Above that floor is where the tooth relic is housed. It is open to the public but is also a place of worship so no footwear or photography.

From there you can take the stairs to the rooftop orchid garden. A place of tranquility and peace amongst the noise of Chinatown.

1 x ' felt uncomfortable with the ostentatious decor' and 'a bit of a rip-off'

Note: it's free buddy, but not a Protestant church, soz.

1 x 'a bit of a disappointment' ... 'if you have been to all of the temples in Beijing and HK'

Editor's side: so, probably 3 or 4 stars then, mate?

2 x 'amazing temple'

Thought: probably gave Louvre 1 star as well. This star system is tricky, eh guys!

4 x 'it's a fake' slash 'not really authentic' slash 'go to a real temple' slash 'it's a sham'

Counterpoint: practicing monks, space for laymen to actively meditate, thousands of Buddha statues, and a physical building for spiritual guidance and practice probably come close enough to the definition of a temple to appease the common man.

2 x 'waste of time' with 'nothing to see and boring'

Observation: there is probably only one other four-floored building in Singapore that has more to see. 2 men's junk is 3000 other men's treasure. Also noteworthy that this contributor gives 1 star to the MRT, which clearly has to be one of, if not the best in the world, while giving the Sultan's Mosque 5 stars as it is 'good for taking photo'.

1 x illogical argumentum ad passiones regarding posing questions to the monks concerning Tibetan monk self-immolation and that 'the temple was built with dozens of millions of dollars and kilograms of gold'

Score: 5 star review with 1 star sense, let's call it a perfect 5 out of 7.

1 x full unedited review: ""Because it's there? Scientists say this is the tooth of an animal. This place is less than a decade old. No history - so why""

Dr Zoidberg's reply: why not?

Summary: this is clearly a true gem in the heart of Singapore's downtown, with a vegetarian restaurant in the basement, an amazing opportunity to photograph monks chanting in an out-of-this-world setting, convenient location 4 minutes walk to MRT, SMRT at the door, a Buddhist museum, a true vibe space to meditate, a rooftop garden to chill, the world's largest Tibetan prayer wheel, a place of pilgrimage for those who believe the temple holds a relic of Gautama Buddha, and is totally free.

It is a Tang-Dynasty style building. The temple gets its name from what the Buddhists regard as the left canine tooth of Buddha, which has been recovered from his funeral pyre in Kushinagar, India and displayed in its grounds. It contains thousands of small buddha statues at wall sides and a few large statues of buddhas and bodhisattva. The interior design can be seen very costly and is built to serve a reminder to everyone about its culture and religon. The best time to go is around 9 to 10am as it wont be that crowded and filled with tourist. There will also be chnating held in there sometimes, when it is an important day for buddhsim or maybe a festival event or to follow the 8 precepts event. There is also the 12 chinese animal zodiac and their respective buddhas or bodhisattva and there will be notes of how your attitude may be like or your character

My two colleagues was Buddhist from Sri Lanka and the one was coincidentally a Buddhist priest so he was excited at being able to explore this temple.

One can visit this interesting temple for free. Whilst the outside was bustling and inside, there was a calm and peaceful atmosphere prevailing. Various buddhas was on the walls with the different modes of Chinese calendar, ie. Year of the Rooster, the Dragon, etc. It was fund trying to find the Buddha that matched the year of myr birth and animal. The temple has 5 stories with a giant rolling prayer wheel on the top floor.

On top, on the fourth floor, you will find a lovely garden and the Ten Thousand Buddhas Pagoda, which holds a large Vairocana Buddha Prayer Wheel. Just take a minute and sit on a bench in this peaceful place!

A visit to BTRTM (whether or not one is religious) offers a variety of meaningful, engaging experiences. First, the temple area proper is impressive in size and decor, with a great hall centered on sizeable Sakyamuni Buddha, often you can witness ceremonies and chanting. It is lined with countless small Buddha figures, and offers bilingual signage. Second, the museum on the 3rd floor is well thought out, rich in sculptures especially from various countries and centuries. It is organized sequentially along the stages of Buddha's life, e.g. Sculptures depicting his youth are shown alongside passages about that stage of his life (English/Chinese). I learned a lot and felt very peaceful following this narrative journey of words and art. Third, the 5th floor with the tooth relic offers a serene and cool meditation area. A monk is often there. The tooth relic is set far behind a large glass window so it is a bit hard to view. Fourth, the orchid garden on the roof is very nice with a huge prayer wheel (mani wheel) that you can spin. Fifth, there are good vegetarian lunches served in the basement for a donation on weekdays. Sixth, the life size wax figures of famous monks on the mezzanine are sppokily fascinating.

When entering the gate, you’ll immediately notice the stunning main hall with its high ceiling. It is located at 288 South Bridge St. It opens at 7am and closes at 7pm and is free of charge. The bell tower and drum tower are on the same floor. However, the main focus for most visitors is the solid gold two-metre stupa on the fourth floor which is the place where the sacred relic is kept. Continuing up to the roof, there is a pagoda that has a large prayer wheel. A mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe and the temple is built based on this symbol. Tours are available and take about 1 hour. There is a little teahouse located on the second floor which is a nice place to relax after the tour. Tea and some vegetarian cuisine is served. The temple holds ceremonies on a daily basis; visitors are allowed to take photos, even during services. Avoid off-the-shoulder T-shirts, shorts and mini-skirts as dress with respectful attire is required when visiting the temple.",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 00:26:54.757179

It is a large and ornate temple that is in daily use by local Buddhists, so if you visit please dress conservatively and be respectful.

This temple's main claim to fame is that it houses a tooth of the Lord Buddha. I mean no disrespect, but the normal adult human has 32 teeth and around the world there are hundreds of Buddhist temples that lay claim to one of those 32 teeth.

One thing that did surprise me here, as I live in Thailand and am used to visiting Buddhist temples, is that nobody, including the Buddhist monks, took off their shoes.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 00:27:34.010875

It's a functioning temple located in Chinatown. There are many individal Buddha shrines in the temple and explanations of their religious significance. It's visually breathtaking and drips with gold. There were preparations for the Chinese New Year when I went and there were coloured lanterns and additional decorations in preparation for that.
It houses a museum and rooftop orchid garden on its upper floors, Admission is free though donations are accepted.

First of all make sure you have something that covers your shoulders and knees. They do provide shaws and wraps but you don't know how many people have used them.
we started from the top where there is a small rooftop garden and made our way down to the ground floor. if you have the time then give yourself at least 1 hour to expore each floor as there are displays and different buddha's to take in.",11-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 00:28:26.253029
