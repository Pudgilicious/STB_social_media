Spend nearly a whole day visiting all the shopping malls. There is a very large UNIQLO and Takashimaya! During our visit to Takashimaya they had the moon cake bazar at the lower level. Tried unusual flavours including durian moon cake, very interesting flavour and texture! Not my first choice.
Each shopping mall has their own food courts and the food is reasonable priced with a wide variety of choice. The food republic, food courts, are the best! My kids were given $10 Singapore each and they were able to buy a main, drink and a dessert! That‚Äôs value!
Also look out for the ice cream carts on the streets The vendors cut cubed ice cream bars and put them between a slice of bread instead of a cone, for $2 Singapore dollars!!! The cone option is also available if you choose but where is the fun in that!!
Went to some high end shops but prices are sky high!! Prices are better in the States or Europe for handbags and high end clothes.
Walked the length of Orchard street, up and down. Do go into each mall if possible as they are unique and interesting. Tangs has more traditional options with more local arts and craft. The bedsheets are great price for 100% cotton.
Gets crowded in the weekends and evenings when everyone is out of work. In the evening we stopped at a bar with street view seating, did some people watching. Best way to end the day with a cocktail and beer!",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 02:21:32.987189

If you are traveling above ground, it has lush large trees covering you from the sun.

The contribution I would add is do consider how you will go about traveling this road. Walking is perhaps the best way. Though with all the stops and purchases considered, you will need to dedicate a day to travel around. If you are traveling with family and pushing a stroller around you might want to consider allocating a day.

A good option to travel around is with Grab. It doesn‚Äôt take long to get a Grab since Grab Drivers are probably counting on getting an order considering how crowded the road gets. $8 on Grab would take you around most of Orchard Road though this goes up to $11 when it‚Äôs 10 PM and the shopping malls closes.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-30 02:21:35.052000

You can walk from one end of the street, near the Orchard Hotel near Orange Grove Road all the way to Plaza Singapore and the Cathay at the other end and just shop until you drop.

Even though I have been here hundreds of times over the years, and prefer exploring more cultural and historical and natural places, I still really love to come here.

For me, Orchard Road is a must-visit place when in Singapore. It's also a good place to visit on a rainy day since you can sometimes go from mall to mall without even going outdoors.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-30 02:22:02.275265

The Orchard shopping belt is to Singapore what Oxford Street is to London and Sydney. Once the haven of shoppers and tourists, the area has seen stiff competition emerge from e-commerce channels and online retailers. Nevertheless, the entire belt which stretches from the Wheelock place area till Plaza Singapura, still hosts a blend of Malls catering to various shoppers, eg for those looking for branded goods (iON, Paragon), Mixed tenanted Malls such as Wisma Atria, 313 Somerset, Centrepoint and Plaza Singapura.

A new retail concept featuring locally designed goods and merchandise has emerged in a place called Design Orchard, located midway in the Orchard Road belt, diagonally opposition the Mandarin Orchard hotel. It hosts local designers including autistic artists (if you are keen on seeing a fuller range, visit The Enabling Village located in Redhill, and a 10-15 walk from Redhill MRT station).

Orchard Road can‚Äôt be covered in one day, especially if you‚Äôre shopping with men or young teenage boys. Your best bet would be to first get a quick lay of the land to decide which Malls you want to spend more time in. Then drop the men or males at a location where they can play games in a cafe (just do a Google search for cafes that allow you to play board games and charge by the hour with coffee and drinks thrown in), or engage in indoor activities like The Escape Room (where they have to solve puzzles to escape from a series of trapped rooms) etc....that will allow to shop in peace and comfort for about 3 hours. Or just let them loose in a hardware or electrical goods store along Orchard Road

For those looking for more ethnic items, your best bet would be to explore Little India, Arab Street or the little alleys around Chinatown",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 02:23:03.951255

(Also, we bought almost half of our souvenirs in that mall since it was the cheapest compared to others).

Honestly, we (together with my companions) never got a chance to explore Orchard Road since we only went there to visit the mall that I was saying a while ago. But as we were travelling, and base on the reviews or what I heard from other travellers, you can find/do lots of things here. A bookshop (which I really regretted since I didn't get a chance to visit it) which offers special edition books at a reasonable price can be found here; affordable hotels are also located here; and lots of food and other establishments are here.

So next time you'll visit Singapore, or if you will visit Singapore for the first time, include Orchard Road in your itinerary and explore it to find real gems.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 02:25:18.909095

Now (2018) most of that experience is gone. If you want 300 stores selling Chanel, Gucci or Rolex then sure, it‚Äôs all right here but frankly I leave the West to get away from superficial junk, not to see more of it. McDonalds, Starbucks, Universal Studios...it‚Äôs everywhere.

If you believe spending a lot of money makes you more important, you can waste money till your credit card melts on Orchard Road!

We lived just off Orchard road near Paragon for over 2 years and I loved it. I loved walking up and down Orchard road. A lot of the shopping malls and MRT stations are all connected together so it is all air conditioned all the way through...... I love 313 Republic food court on the 5th floor as it has very good food like Monster Curry and Teppaniyaki.....all very good prices...lots of seats.....great open space....

Lots of restaurants to choose from very expensive like Lawry‚Äôs Or Wild Honey to very good value like Monster Curry......

There is something for everyone.... ‚Äúparagon mall‚Äù has a nice playground on the 5th floor for children.... 313 has a nice playground on the roof on 5th floor outside the food court for children...... lots of children‚Äôs shops and for adults too.... so many coffee shops and bakeries..... Supermarkets like Cold Storage and Food Hall in Takashimaya and Paragon and CentrePoint......
All fast food places available: MacDonalds, Burger King, Mos Burger......

Toast box is one of my favourite places to eat and it‚Äôs everywhere like in CentrePoint, Paragon (outside opposite Mount Elizabeth Hospital), Wisma....

Department stores like Metro, Robinson‚Äôs, Isetan, Takashimaya, Tang.......all excellent....

Lots of pharmacies (like Guardian and Watson‚Äôs)...... very good one in Paragon and 313 and a huge Guardian and Watson‚Äôs in Ngee Ann City.....
Absolutely love the B2 floor of Takashimaya as it has all sorts of foods and bakeries and a market in the middle which changes every 2 weeks/monthly (not sure)..... last week it was a baby market and we were able to buy all sorts of things at great prices.....last time it was a ‚Äúluggage‚Äù market and back in August it was a mooncake market.

There is a cinema and a big trampoline place just off Orchard road near 313.....
Another cinema next to Isetan.....

Lots of hotels in and around Orchard road.... our favourite hotel where we always stay is Mandarin Orchard because of its perfect location next toTakashimaya....l

Highly recommend Orchard Road..... my favourite place in the world..... no need to go anywhere else a as you can find everything in Orchard Road.....I could live in Orchard Road forever.....

1 week is never enough for us just for Orchard Road.....",06-2018,Family,2020-01-30 02:26:22.054895

In 19th century there were only several plantations, not too many houses & graveyards here & there...

Only in 20th century then ORCHARD ROAD had shops & its first supermarket C. K. TANG.

Now, it is the shopping paradise for the rich. A lot of landmark buildings & shopping malls -- TANG Plaza, ION Orchard, Ngee Ann City (TAKASHIMAYA), 313@somerset & PLAZA SINGAPURA, tens of hotels besides.

Very unique is that one end of The ORCHARD ROAD is the city state President's office, The ISTANA, the other end is the price winning BOTANIC GARDENS.

You can reach ORCHARD ROAD by subway train called MRT & alight at ORCHARD Station. The MRT (network) map is available for FREE at any Station Office.

Look up a place or two in advance to explore and then see how the days goes. You might not get to your restaurant or shop, but you will likely find some amazing things.

Keys to wandering: The underground passageways are where it's all at. Take any escalator down and you will find yourself in a massive labyrinth of cool air, tiny delicious eateries and entire food courts, clean restrooms, and pathways to anywhere else you want to go on Orchard. If you are exploring it's best to just follow a tunnel and don't worry too much where you end up. You can always catch a taxi to get back to your final destination, or ask anyone you see who doesn't look in a hurry for directions. Better yet, surrender your itinerary to the adventure of it all and see where you end up. There is wifi everywhere (even underground) but signage can be confusing. Rest assured there will be food, drink, and a cab available no matter where you surface.

A few of my favorites: Isetan Japanese Grocery underneath the Shaw House for interesting food including bakery treats, take away snacks and fun Japanese candy. Tangs is a locally owned department store. Basement level has a tiny ""hawker center"" type of food court where you can sample hawker fare. Check out level 4 for unique gadgets and gifts & a lovely tea house lunch room that brings back olden days and has a fantastic view. If you're down at Paragon don't miss the food court basement level.

Final tips you might not hear elsewhere:
-Don't be put off by high-end shops if you do not consider yourself that type of shopper.
Everyone is welcome to browse and they have fun, unusual items.
-Hotels bars and restaurants are open to visitors and often offer excellent F&B choices.
-Cabs stop in designated spots so ask where to queue for one and trust the driver knows
what they are doing when they have to drive around to drop you off.
-If the heat is getting to you stop off for a cold drink and small bite. You will find amazing food everywhere so eat like a local; small amounts as often as possible.
-Eat EVERYTHING!! Try some things you've never had. Food in Singapore is Everything.

One more note: I find it hard to get info for teens. So this is one thing everyone can enjoy. Teens (mine) love the tunnels. This is where the more affordable shops are and teens are welcome. If they need to get out on their own you can split up and plan a meeting place somewhere central like the steps in front of ION. They will likely find the $2 Daiso store in the ION basement and will find endless quirky items to bring home from their Singapore adventure. Scape is also a great place for teens. It's located halfway down the street (toward Dhoby Ghot MRT from ION) just behind Cathay between Orchard & Grange.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 02:31:43.391888

Orchard Road is Orchard Road, great strip for window shopping or shop till you drop if you have endless cash to spend.

Shopping mall after shopping mall, from the original Tang to the newer one like Sommerset, Paragon, or Ion. Or you also have option to go to the sort of Lucky Plaza to go for bargain shopping.

For first time Singapore visitor, its a must go, so you can experience walking down this famous shopping strip.

First, the is a mecca for shoppers. Mind you, prices at some places were more than those we spotted in London and New York, but rest assured, the collections there are unbeatable - this was for the high street shopper. Mid range shoppers have a few opportunities here and there, but folks looking for a bargain, that's not the place for you.

One thing you should experience is the ION ORCHARD. It is literally an underground mall. Funny thing is that you never feel that you are 3 or 4 and sometimes 5 levels under street level. Also, the food options there are better than else were.

May it be a whole day of shopping, people watching, gawking or just stoning...! There's a long stretch of Orchard Road,with large shopping malls, eateries, cinemas, wide walking spaces. This place is easily accessible from one end to the other end, with a safe underground crossing, and cheap transport along the way, if you wish to take a short ride in the local bus. Though Orchard Road is not the cheapest place to shop in Singapore, the hundreds of different brands of items, varieties, that one can have as great options or choices.
Besides being a shoppers' paradise, Orchard Road has a vibrant, cosmopolitan presence. This is the place where you can also catch a on-the-spot live show on the street. It could be a live juggling act, a solo musician doing a live keyboard or guitar gig on the street, or a cheeky clown doing his 'thing' to the amusement of lunchtime crowds. For the not so spritely, there are benches for short walking rests along the long stretch of Orchard Road. At the end of Orchard Road, towards Holland Road, is where one locate the Singapore Botanical Gardens.....another place that one should not miss visiting. And towards the opposite end is the Bras Basah area, also another exciting place not to be missed.
If shopping is not your in your do list, then simply flit around to watch your favourite films in the absolutely clean cinemas, with superb surround sound systems to match.
There are also tons of varieties of eats to choose from, fine-dining, simple hawker foods, street foods in the shopping malls, with hygenic and clean environments. Take your pick of local, French, Italian, Indian, German food varieties, and you will surely be astonish with all the hundred of options you can hope to find.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-30 02:33:03.181337

If you have kids, you may wish to concentrate on one shopping centre. Some have activities for kids and toy stores but otherwise, I don't recommend bringing them for an all-day visit. It's not that exciting for them.
Paragon is great for high-end labels, toys, sporting labels. Takashimaya is the Japanese department store so has some Japanese labels and an amazing food/dining floor on the basement level. Orchard Central has many interesting shops.

Head up the IONsky (find the entrance on level 4 on the ION mall) is free and an amazing view. The food markets at the bottom of many of the malls are great for access to a wide variety of traditional Singaporean foods. The pick of the food courts is Tang's.

I mostly stay on the Shaw House Lido Cinema side of the street, frequenting Ion, Tangs and Takashimaka. It is so nice to have underground walkways between these shopping malls (or centers) so you don't have to walk in the heat. All 4 of the complexes have great food courts where you can eat until you are stuffed. You can also shop at the expensive designer stores in any of them. I believe there are 2 Louis Vuittons between the 4 shopping malls. Along Orchard Road, keep an eye out for ice cream vendors around lunch time. You can get yummy ice cream sandwiches for S$1.20 and if you are lucky, you can get 4 different flavor mini scoops in a cup.

With a family of two young kids we find it easier to stay at orchard road when vacationing in Singapore due to the ease of finding food & public transport.
My fav place to visit is ION & the basement level in Takashimaya (food market) where there's so many yummy treats!
Depending on how you shop, it can take you a few days to go through every shop or if you're a speed shopper like me, I can do it in one day ;)
Don't forget to try the ice cream with bread along the orchard strip, you can find a few vendors there!

For those who love to shop, it's a shoppers paradise, for those who don't, it's your worst nightmare! 5kms of shops (2.5kms on either side of the road). There are shopping centres, upon shopping centres, both above ground and underground. It's like nothing we've witnessed before.

However, everything is very expensive. In many cases more expensive than Australia so don't expect to find a bargain. So many designer brands, Tiffany's, Chanel, Dior, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Dolce & Gabbana and so on... In general, Singapore is a very expensive city. Food and drink prices are outrageous. After, a few hours on Orchard Road, you begin to realize these shopping complexes all offer the same things. They become very repetitive with nothing new to offer. Good for a visit though, if not to shop, to be amused by the Asians stopping anywhere and everywhere to pose for a photo! Very bizarre...",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 02:36:13.185193

I removed half my laundry and gave them my essentials to launder and deliver to my hotel.

However, there is very little information provided by way of warnings to unwary visitors about the scum who prey on those tourists who are inexperienced or easily manipulated.
It is easy to dismiss these situations with the admonishment ""let the buyer beware"", but the reality is that most people automatically assume a level of honesty based on their own 'home' environment whilst at the same time their judgement is most often affected by a variety of external factors such as being in ‚Äúholiday mode‚Äù, being in another country, dealing with people of a different nationality, etc.
Tourists do have a responsibility to protect their own interests but it is an indictment of the tourism authorities that they do not provide a facility for tourists to lodge effective complaints relating to these unsavoury dealings and naming/shaming those who are known to carry out such practices.
In my case as an almost 70 year old visitor to Singapore I was cheated out of several thousand dollars by Camera Comp Specialist Pte Ltd of 220 Orchard Road by being charged more than was originally quoted for various items as well as being sold incompatible and over-priced accessories. I realise I should have known better and cannot explain how or why I was so easily duped, other than the fact that I accepted what I was being told. However I would like to help others avoid either the financial or mental stress or the physical pain (caused by an angina attack) brought about by my experience with this company.

Some even think a hotel would not be good if its far from Orchard road (despite an adequate transport system in Singapore).
What is so special about Orchard road anyway? In my opinion is nothing. Is just a barrage of luxury shopping centers that selling upmarket goods, which is not interesting for me.
My cousins and aunties thought that the items that they purchase in here have prestige value despite the fact that the very same item can be found in upper class shopping centers in Indonesia, with lower price.

There are banks and ATMs, money chengers, bars, restaurants,street vendors (pizza and kebab caravans) coffee shops.

Buses are continuously going up and down Orchard Road as are taxis so you can always get there and back to your hotel no matter where you are staying.
Many of the shops are open until 11.00 pm so there is always enough time to wander through the various locations.
There are also tailors located on Orchard Road who will custom make clothing for you, in fact my wife picked up a custom made silk jacket for work for only $350 SGD.

You may even get lucky and get a bargain at Lucky Plaza or Far East Plaza, but do be careful at the time of the deal, and check the goods as well as the receipt carefully, as there have been fraud incidents before.

The Road itself is pleasurable to stroll, especially in the evenings as well as around occasions such as Christmas or Chinese New Year.

For low-cost goods and clothing, go to Chinatown (Chinatown or Outram Park MRT stations), or what the Government advertises as the 'Heartland' malls: i.e. the suburban malls, some of which are very good.

Central location
Easy access to transport ( taxi or subway)
Multiple and easy Choices for food
Window shopping
Real shopping is for people with deep pockets as street is lined by designer shjops for clothes or watch. Big malls are paragon, takashimaya, and independent styores like isetan, tangs and Robinson. Although sales were going on the prices were not enticing enough.

You‚Äôre not going to find anything that adds cultural value or expands your mind. This isn‚Äôt gong to make you a global citizen of any sort. You‚Äôre not going to walk away a changed person.

You will, however, very likely be impressed by the size, scale, and grandeur with which Singaporeans approach their ultra high end shopping experience. The malls run for what seem like miles, and connect through underground passageways linked to the subway...where they leave the ‚ÄòB-list‚Äô stores like Sephora, J-Crew or the like.

What you‚Äôll see at street level is impressive, and arguably more beautiful at night when you can see the spectacle all lit up. You‚Äôll also quickly notice that there are repeats all up and down the road. There are at least half a dozen Rolex stores that you can see while standing still, for example.

This is a monument to consumerism at its finest. If you‚Äôre into shopping for seriously high end goods, you‚Äôll feel right at home. If not, you may well find it overwhelming and/or quite a bit overdone.",11-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 02:42:29.628913

Our most recent visit to the island state was no different. We were on a Hop on, Hop off bus and when it reached one of the bus stops near the top end of Orchard Road, we hopped off to do a bit of shopping.
One immediate difference noted in contrast to previous visits to Orchard Road was the fact that smoking is now banned along the length of the road. There are large signs advising of this painted on the footpaths. Apparently the ban has been in place since earlier this year. This ban no doubt makes non-smokers happy and smokers unhappy!
As with our previous visits, we managed to visit a number of different shopping centres located along the road. We also popped into several department stores and numerous specialty shops.
Because Singapore is considered to have one of the most expensive cities in the world in which to live, we didn‚Äôt find too many bargains but as always, it was fun to search for them.

We have been visiting this city for the past 20 years & therefore know it in & out!!
In fact I always think of offering my services as The short cut queen of Orchard road to first time visitors!!
In fact to navigate the maze & plethora of stores , arcades, malls& boutiques - a guide would surely come handy. But for the first time visitor to Orchard - it can be pretty bewildering!! Choices aplenty, confusion could reign supreme! But the true shopper is spoilt for choice!!!
For the ladies- shoes, bags, accessories, makeup ‚Äî- everything is there in multiples. For the man- sports goods, sneakers, expensive & inexpensive fashion, barbers, tailors & leather‚Äî nothing is missing. Household stores are expensive but plenty. Every international brand is there for the taking. It‚Äôs best to start way up at Tanglin Mall - just after the beautiful Botanical Gardens& slowly wind ones way down to Singapura Plaza at Dhobi Ghaut. Style mile to say the least!!The other end of Orchard!
These days the malls I would highly recommend‚Äî not to be missed- Tanglin Mall for Europeon stores- British India,baby stores, fashion , stationery& the House of Ann Li - for home decor & a quick bite, Forum- for Eyewear, children‚Äôs high end clothes boutiques, Watson‚Äôs, Toys r Us & Jamie Oliver‚Äôs.
Hilton‚Äôs shopping gallery- go ogle the high end stores like Italiandesigner jewels, Ezmes French swimwear!
Then Wheelock place for a huge Marks & Spencer‚Äôs outlet, an Apple store& service centre, Zara, Massimo Dutti & plenty of hair salons, nail spas & Browhaus! On the opposite side is Shaw Centre with Isetan , Ralph Lauren & one of the best multi plexes of this city. Continuing on the same pavement- via the underpass , the iconic CK Tangs& the glittering new Scott‚Äôs. Eat at the Wild honey outlet there for sure & check out Michael Kors latest offerings!! Continue down to Paragon- skipping the ‚Äòdownmarket ‚ÄòLucky Plaza‚Äî totally avoidable unless u are looking for Western Union money transfer!!
Paragon is hip & happening with an amazing choice of cuisines in the basement! Ogle at Choo, Prada,Dior, Ferragamo & eat at PS Cafe on level 2. Marks & Spencer‚Äôs & Metro both tempt for practical everyday dressing.

Another must visit breakfast place is Wild honey. Amazing food. I advice you to book in advance as it‚Äôs generally packed. Incase you did not book; don‚Äôt worry. It opens up in 15-20 min.
The nightlife around this area is great. Too many to choose from. No specific recommendations. Alcohol is expensive in Singapore. So be prepared to spend.

This sort of attraction (shopping) isn't really our thing. Now, everybody needs to eat and this place definitely has some great deals, choices and locations well worth visiting.

What would you find here?

Several department stores with famous brands on display are waiting for you. Looking at prices I can see there isn't much difference with Australia and it might be a tad expensive for an American. But the shopping malls are very interesting to watch. Inside some of these, you will find glorious food courts and restaurants. I do recommend these last ones, is a good representation of the food in Asia.

On this road, you will also find a few galleries and museums, out of which I think the Singapore Art Museum is well worth the visit if you are trying to escape the crowd and the busy noise of the street.

One can visit most of the shops by being either underground or undercover, so the erratic Singapore rains don't really hamper the visit. Shopping centres are situated on both sides of the road, with trees providing the much needed visual relief from concrete and glass. Takashimaya has got to be my favourite (have been visiting it for over a decade), and that connects to Ngee Ann City, which connects to wisma atria and that connects to Ion which also has the Orchard Park MRT station. It's all superbly convenient!

The other side has Tangs (my wife's favourite shopping centre), which pretty much connects to Lucky Plaza (a sort of budget mall). From here one can get wet in the rain, but just barely, as Paragon is very close.

Ofcourse this is just the one section of Orchard road. It's longer than this, and has heaps more to provide, with plethora of shopping, eating options.

The fountain in front of Ngee Ann City is my favourite place to just sit and chill (okay chill is probably the wrong word given Singapore's heat and humidity) in the evenings.

To us, any visit to Singapore is not complete unless we have spent a day just enjoying what Orchard road has to offer.

If you are going to Singapore for the first time, would absolutely recommend staying at a hotel on Orchard.",11-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 02:54:01.551692

This place glitters in all its glory, but at the same time, the contrasts here are fascinating - on one side you will see the biggest luxury brands such as LV, Hermes, Prada in huge malls, while in another corner you will find modest shop-houses, housing cute little bars.

Easily accessible by public transport from Somerset or Orchard MRT (red line).

If you are keen to shop (call this my 'orchard shopping trail'), I recommend getting off at Somerset and walking towards Orchard mrt - begin by checking out 313@somerset (brands like Forever 21, Cotton On, Zara, Mango, Victoria Secret are all here). This place has some really great eateries too - consider having lunch here first (the thai place is great, so is al marƒáhe) and then starting your (window or not) shopping.

Once done here, head over to the H&M building next to 313, which is their flagship store spread across 3-4 floors and has a good collection and sale items most of the time. Go to the 2nd floor and check out the sale section - I have found some great stuff there.

PS: notice the birds chirping around this area, it is so loud and lovely, you can't miss it.

Once done at H&M, join the large number of pedestrians right outside the store, waiting to cross Grange road to go over to Takishimaya. Here onwards, it is a really pleasant stroll, you will often see street artists and musicians performing here, and people sitting on parapets watching.

Most of the luxury brands are located in this part of orchard road, so may be worth paying a visit if you are interested.

There are some great photo ops too for first timers who want to take some pictures, or regulars looking to keep their instragram followers updated. =)

You will know the trail has ended once you reach the colourfully lit stairs and the glass dome which is the entry-way to Orchard mrt.

I used to typically head home after this, but there's a new bar area opposite somerset (near centrepoint mall) that I have started to like very much. So I now end my shopping trip after H&M, and head there instead - for some drinks followed by a massage at Natureland. I will review these places separately another day!

Remember, Orchard road is not a tourist attraction, but a way of life. Try and spend an afternoon here and be one of the locals. :)",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 02:54:31.646957

It's AMAZING, we got totally and wonderfully lost amongst the hundreds of shops underground, it's blissfully cool down there , so many shops it's mind boggling , honestly, there are interlinking shopping centres that feel like they go for miles, as with everything in Singapore, it's pristine cleanliness, and so blissfully cool, you could spend your whole holiday underground ( buy please don't, because Singapore has SO MUCH to offer) .

Also you can access the other side of the road via underground walkways without having to go back outside. And also the MRT runs under there too.
Tangs is another hugh shopping treat right across the road from the ION or on the other corner Marks and Spencers if that's your go. A few blocks down is another large Department store that I love ""Robinsons"".
Also there a some nice gardens down orchard road and you can take in the Singapore Embassy as well although it is guarded day and night and of course you can't go in but you can take a picture.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 03:01:42.157678

It's a good stroll and very packed but with a lovely atmosphere . There are also many shopping centres everywhere , around 10 on orchard road I think.

On this street you will find every brand you might think of. If you know how much it costs in your country, multiply x2, or x3 and you will get the price. :o)
The one thing for sure is that you will be buying a genuine product. This is why many Asians come to Singapore to shop. They don't want to buy the fake version.

There is also the President's house which you can walk past (only open to the public a few times per year).

Very high end shops, terrific Japanese huge stores like Takashimaya, and plenty of tourists. Be careful about ""good deals"" found in the stores. You really need to be somewhat experienced about fair prices and also negotiating when it comes to goods in the stores. (Does not apply to big box stores or restaurants).
Note also that many stores are run by Chinese Singaporeans....wonderful people. If you find something that you really want in a particular store, make sure you notice location of item and the store and then MAKE sure you are first in line the next morning into the store. You can then walk to the item you are interested in and begin the negotiation. The store owners expect this...to a fault. However, be prepared to walk out of the store if you don't get your price. I'd recommend you do exactly that. The store owner will follow you to make the sale. Old proverb: if the store owner makes a sale to the first customer, that day will be most successful!

Why? because Orchard Road is a wide busy street so the Singaporeans have build not only subways under the road but food malls and shops ... so when you go down on one side you come up on the other side ... but no usually directly across the street.

I have to say here that it was night time and I don't think we would have had the same problem in the daytime.

There are also MRT stations under the buildings and without a visual reference, my sense of direction leaves town.

We were staying at a hotel on Scotts Road (which intersects with Orchard Road and only a few minutes walk away but one night we just got lost ... we went down the escalator in the Ion Centre and appeared someplace else ... we proceeded to walk in a direction away from the hotel until we asked a man with a smartphone how to get back ... he sent us in another direction again and he was a local.

We finally got far enough away from the hotel to see the sigh on the top of the roof and headed back in that direction.

Orchard Road is shoppers and diners paradise and you can lighten you wallet really quickly if you are not careful ... the prices are pretty much the same as other developed western countries but you can claim back the GST if purchases from each shop equal or exceed SGD100.

We spent a lot of time sampling the different cuisines in Food Republic on level 4 of the Wisma Atria at 435 Orchard Road ... there are over 25 different shops catering to all Asian cuisines.

I would recommend tourists to pick a hotel around this area if you are keen on accessibility and various options on food and shopping. You might want to check out Grand Park Orchard hotel which is located at a wonderful location.

You will be able to find various departmental stores like Tangs & Robinsons here along with bigger brands like ZARA, Coach and etc.

If you are keen in branded shopping, i do suggest heading to Orchard Ion Mall (directly connected to Orchard MRT station). It has lots of branded stores like Coach, Louis Vuitton, etc.

Food choices around the area is pretty large too!

You might want to avoid shopping on weekends if you are a tourist here. Lesser crowds during weekdays for sure!",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:07:59.749056

If you like shopping, and that's the only real reason to go to Orchard Road now in my view, then you'll love it but, for me, it has lost the quirky appeal it used to have.
Saddest of all, Raffles Hotel now resembles an upmarket Harvester rather than anything Kipling or Conrad would recognise. I guess that's progress though.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:10:15.082253

Take the time to visit the food courts in the malls and mingle with the locals while enjoying a very reasonably priced, tasty meal.

Wander along the tree line street and stop to buy a $1.20 slice of Walls ice cream wrapped in a slice of coloured bread or placed between two wafers. There are a few of these carts along the street and we found that the nicest, friendliest vendor was the lady with the cart closest to Ion Mall.

Sit on one of the seats that line the street and just watch the world go by. I think that every nationality in the world is represented on Orchard Road.

Whilst sitting, I observed a little Chinese girl break away from her parents and run up to a little Indian girl and take her hand. The families obviously didn't know each other because they appeared surprised at the little girl's spontaneous action, however they all smilingly acknowledged each other before walking off in opposite directions.

So I went to one of the Limited Edition Store today (3/3/16) and I had a terrible experience at LE. WAY 313@Somerset. I just finished my dinner and decided to look for a pair of shoes. I went to the store and one of the staff who was wearing white shirts, shorts and white janoski max and he has also pony tail being very rude, impolite, and disrespectful. At first, I asked if the shoes I found got any discounts since they put it on the floor and next to the 40% tag and he replied me by saying with a mocking tone ""If all shoes got discount this is going to be a flea market."" I was surprised but I didn't say a word about it. I asked bcs someone just asked if the shoes he was holding got any discounts but I didn't hear the rest of the conversation that's why I asked. After he said such ridiculous reply, I kindly ask him if he could get me a pair of the shoes that I held, with my size. So then he managed to get me one and I tried it but unfortunately the shoes is too big, so I asked him to help me with the smaller size. Then he checked on the system and he couldn't find one. And He purposedly told me to get it from the other store in Scape!!! He said, ""That's all we got, and the other one on the floor. You just go to Scape."" And I replied to him that actually it's slightly too big not much but compare to the one I usually use I could feel that it's abit loose. Finally, since he told me to leave and go to the other store, I asked him what is the type or code of the shoes. AND he said with a rude mocking tone to his collegue ON MY FACE, ""THIS GUY KEEPS ON ASKING ME QUESTIONS AND BOTHERING ME!!!! YOU GO ASK HIM WHAT HE NEEDS."" What the heck is that. What kind of customer service LE Way store offers. I actually about to purchased the shoes although it's a bit too big, but with such attitudes I finally left the store and went home not with the shoes but worst shopping experience I have ever encountered. I'm really disappointed with such experience that I got, especially to know that the store is located in the tourist area, how can such customer service behavior is being practiced. I believe Limited Edition management should put this into consideration. I regret that I didn't scold the guy on his face bcs I was so sick at that moment and just wanted to leave the store. I hope you guys won't encountered such experience in this store, but If you unfortunately must face this employee with his attitudes please scold him on his face and give feedback to their management/manager on duty.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:12:11.520590

Along Orchard Roads length, which is approx. 2.2km is just a plethora of shopping Malls catering for all types of tastes and pockets. From more budget conscious Malls such as Lucky Plaza (popular with filipinos and gets very crowded at the weekends, particularly on Sundays) and Far east Plaza, to places such as Paragon/ION Orchard and Ngee Ann City which houses all the designer shops and boutiques. Eating/restaurants as you would expect are as diverse as well, with many hawker type centres around, along with places such as food republic at the newish 313 Somerset shopping complex, that connects to Orchard Gateway.. Entertainment complexes such as Shaw Cinemas with its IMAX/Cineplex cinemas.

Of course another location which is famous (more for notoriety) is Orchard Towers. This is a collection of bars, clubs noted for some degree of promiscuity, and is a big attraction for singletons from all over Singapore. Not really a couple place.

Emerald Hill is a pleasant watering hole, with a nice number of restaurants and Pubs..the latter tend to be out of the main Orchard thoroughfare so are pleasant to go to, and some of them do 1 for 1 offers until 8 is...well worth it as the standard price of a beer around Orchard is around 16-18 SGD for a pint!

There always seem to be activities going on and around, and its such a pleasant (aside from the crowd at times) environment to shop even guys don't mind the odd hour there or two..!

Of course, Chinese New Year and Christmas time see the area transformed ...amazing decorations, lights, exhibits, figurines...it truly is a pleasure to visit at this time. In terms of MRT access, you can start with Doby Ghaut at the bottom of Orchard Road, and then Somerset (mid Orchard) ending with Orchard Road itself, provide great entry/exit points for visiting. Note, that Somerset and Orchard are large MRT stations, so try and use the signs and match with which road/exit you need. Fortunately, Singapore is great for directions in this sense at its MRTs.

Early Morning are, of course, the quietest, as many shops don't open until 10 or 11 am, so its pleasant to stroll along without the heavy crowds...",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:12:30.050994

Christmas decor has always impressed me during each visit to Orchard Road but the last time was over a decade ago.

I started at Orchard Central and ended at Wheelock Place. My impression on each display I viewed are noted below:

Orchard Central decorated its main entrance and provided the largest number of interactive displays down the length of its store front: cable car, hot air balloon and a Christmas tree tunnel. 5 stars.
Orchard Gateway used a bubble machine to create the illusion of snow with their penguins and igloo displays. 4 stars for the displays but 5 stars with the constant ‚Äúsnow‚Äù
313@Somerset setup inside large and glittery present, ornament and tree that you could walk through. 2 stars.
The splendor of stylish you photo op. 3 stars.
Takashimaya deployed simple hearts above its entrance for their Gifts from the Heart theme. 4 stars.
Paragon was all lit up with a storefront tall Christmas tree and strings of hanging lights. 4 stars.
The Christmas wrangle photo op. 5 stars.
Wisma Atria - a smaller version of the Christmas on a Great Street sign. 5 stars.
Lucky Plaza - Unicorn and Carriage and Once upon a time book with its 3D castle. 4 stars.
Ion Orchard/Bulgari showcased their bursting color Christmas Tree. 4 stars. 5 stars if including all their lights.
Wheelock Place gave the best view of the Christmas on a Great Street sign spanning over Orchard Road. Their drum like display allowed us to climb up a winding set of stairs. 5 stars.

Overall another great Christmas experience on a warm and humid night. If you do stay until the shops close be aware that taxis may be tough to come by.",11-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 03:15:00.320489

Orchard Road is a unique street, stretching almost 2kms starting from Tanglin Mall all the way down to City Hall / or, Marina Square and turn Left, towards Suntec City . .

It is unimaginable how many retail shops/ outlets/ restaurants/ you will pass by.....

You can literally spend the whole day at Orchard Road. It begins after Tanglin Mall. It is a beautiful stretch of road lined up with numerous retail shops/ outlets and loads of restaurants... you can decide to cover the left side of orchard road on the 1st day and the opposite side on the 2nd day.

There are so many items for you to see. u should come prepared, by wearing a comfortable pair of shoes and clothes, so that you are able to change easily, when trying on your new clothes whilst shopping. .

Try to starve yourself the day before, so u can consume the many types of food from the different type of restaurants along Orchard Road.

Best time to walk n shop along Orchard Road is during Tues/ Wed/ Thurs, when there are less people / customers ...

I will assure you that, you can keep coming back to Orchard Road again n again n you will never be bored. It is an exciting place.

There are also large Cinemas, like Shaw House, along Orchard Road and Cathay Cinema, near Plaza Singapura Mall/.,

You can opt to take the MRT or local bus to skip a few Malls, if your feet aches after the long stroll along Beautiful Orchard Road.

The June Sale is going on now. You can find loads of discounts. .

There is everything for everyone.

Singapore is still until today, a Shoppers & Food Paradise, these are all Available at Orchard Road.!!

There is nothing spectacular with the goods they carry as you can find in your country. Shopping malls I should say only excites mostly women.

To find local stuff and food, travellers like me who like to go free and easy generally visit shopping malls for gifts. One thing different with Orchard Road are some of the historical places to visit. Doby Ghaut MRT area, used to be washing place for Indians, MacDonald House which Indonesian terrorist bombed before in the 70s.
Plaza Singapura is also one of the oldest shopping mall still standing although it been renovated several times. I recall it used to have the Japanese retailer Yaohan as main tenant.
The president office the Istana which is located next to Plaza Singapura but only open to public on special holidays. Visitors can watch the change of guard of honour usually on 1st day of the month. Similar to the guards at Buckingham Palace.

Other place of interest though can take see but not enter is the Thai embassy which was recently renovated. Far East Plaza is a mall that Filipinos hang out alot. Lido cinema is a cinema that was build in the early years of Singapore. Its been torn down and rebuilt with Isetan taking as primary tenant.

One place I don't like and makes Orchard Road looks very crowded, trap heat and makes Orchard Road so hot these days is ION Orchard. This big tall building throws out alot of heat to make it cold inside.

However, food courts at Orchard Road is very pricey. Same dish can be found in hawker centers else where at a more reasonable price.",02-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 03:15:27.056106

Personally, I don't find our sales to be interesting (including the so called Great Singapore sale) as most of the items are at most 10-20% discounted compared to sales in the States which can see many items at 40% discount or more. Many of the sales items also seem to be items which can't sell. If you would like to experience a more 'local' shopping experience (though you might not buy anything there), try places like Toa Payoh, Little India and Kampong Glam. While you might not buy anything, it might be a more interesting experience. I have bought batik in Kampong Glam for foreign friends- but beware, batik colours run so if you buy batik for anyone, do give them instructions on how to hand wash the batik.",11-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 03:16:13.105077

There was an amazing selection of merchandise at extremely reasonable prices. However, over the past 20-odd years, it's become progressively more expensive. Today you're much better off shopping in the UK or the USA. Even after factoring in the difference in sales taxes or value added taxes (20% VAT in the UK vs 7% GST in Singapore) most things are substantially less expensive in the UK than in Singapore. The reason is not entirely explained by the costs of shop floor space, because Hong Kong has even more expensive retail real-estate yet manages to keep prices at more reasonable levels.

Orchard Road is usually the worst place to buy almost anything in Singapore. The shops are mostly very flashy, but the prices are sky-high and the service delivered by the snotty-nosed shop assistants is very often terrible. If you really want to bag a deal in Singapore you're probably better off going to Chinatown or one of the suburban shopping areas. Many Singaporeans now shop online or wait until they travel overseas. If you're a westerner finding things to fit you here can be difficult or expensive. If you want to go on an Asian shopping trip you are probably better off going to Hong Kong. Singapore is where you're best sticking to window shopping.",01-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 03:17:34.625640

However, although Singapore is probably giving locals (who are very westernized) and tourists what they want, the changes, in my opinion, are making places like Orchard Road less interesting. There are so many up-market sterile type shops in Orchard Road, making it rather boring unless you have pots of money to spend. There are still are few complexes like the ""Lucky Plaza"" that add character, although you wouldn't want the whole street to be like this. And, you can still catch the metro (subway) to China Town to visit similar older style shopping malls.

Whilst I still love Singapore, it is losing some of its appeal. It is just a case of trying to provide a balance of the old with the new. The new is good, but lacks character and charm.",10-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 03:18:29.001468

I usually start my shopping from Wheelock Place (the Zara outlet there is less crowded than the one in Ion) and go down one side of the street to Ion (high end fashion brands from ground to 3rd floor and high street brands from basement 1-3 and food in Basement4), Wisma Atria (new Japanese food town and food court on 4th floor), Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya departmental store, Tiffany, Cartier, etc). These 3 malls are linked via an underground passage way and is linked to Orchard MRT station.

From Takashimaya, you can walk to H&M flagship store in Singapore (just pass Mandarin Orchard Hotel) to 313 Orchard and Orchard Gateway and cross the road to Centrepoint (Metro Departmental Store and grocery store Cold Storage) Or you can cross the road from Ngee Ann City to either Paragon (high end brands like Gucci, Tods and high street brands like Banana Republic, Guess, Esprit and Cold Storage) or Hereen (Robinson Departmental Store). If you loop back to the direction of Orchard MRT, you will also come across Tangs (a local departmental store, their 4th floor sells mostly Singapore and Asian designer stuff). There's many shops and if you are seriously into shopping, you can spend the entire day in Orchard Road.

Below lists the malls nearest to MRT stations:

Orchard MRT - Wheelock Place, Ion, Tangs, Wisma Atria, Paragon, Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya)

Somerset MRT - 313 Orchard, Orchard Gateway, Centrepoint, H&M flagship store, Hereen

So if you are one of those who are on the lookout for luxury brands, just head there and you are sure to find your favourite brand.
Apart from these top rated brands, each mall has a food court where you can find cuisine from across the globe and that, in my opinion, makes this place a favourite with many tourists. Besides them, you can find your regular eatery and cafe chains like Starbucks, Haagen-Dasz, Costa Coffee, Burger King, KFC etc.
It also happens to be the main business district and is very crowded during the day time. In my opinion, you can easily spend a couple of hours strolling along the road in the evening even if you are not a shopaholic. You may also look to get a good ""Happy Hour"" deal at one of the bars close by. I happened to be here around the beginning of the festive season and got to see the amazing Christmas decorations on and along the road.

I, along with several other professors, live at the ""far"" end of Orchard Road. By that, I mean we live at the end farthest from the central city area of Singapore. Our apartment is on Orange Grove Road, and we can walk down to Orchard Road in about three minutes.

You should visit Orchard Road at both ends, our ""far"" and, and down to the city end. Along the way, you will find luxury shopping, such as Ion Orchard Plaza and Ngee Ann City, and you will find more casual shopping, such as at Lucky Plaza. You will find food of every type, and entertainment, also of just about every type. From out end of Orchard Road to the city end, the walk is under three kilometers. It is worth the time to take the walk, and wander into the various shops and malls along the way. Walk during the day, and then come back and walk during the night.

During the Christmas holiday season, Orchard Road is lit from one end to the other. It is glorious. Take a bus at night from the ""far"" end (for example, from the Delfi Plaza stop). Get a double-decker bus and sit on the top level so you can see everything.

Tower host many clubs including tattoo shop, massage parlour and other stuff.
I personally like Ipanama club on 2 nd floor. They have live band performances. Awesome crowd but bit expensive drinks.
If you not interested in clubs then you can also hang around outside of orchard tower. There is this irish pub, muddys and harry's pub. All of them are awesome and food is good too.

Orchard Road is basically a long chain of shopping malls which are able to cater to a wide range of budgets, from your mass produced Uniqlo or H&M everyday clothing, all the way to your Louis Vuitton designer handbag. Because competition is very intense here, shopping malls often undergo renovation and changes often, so you may see a different look every time you come down to Orchard Road.

Even if you are not there to shop, even window shopping can be a good exercise to spend a few hours there with. However, in my opinion, Orchard Road is one of the few places in Singapore to do some great street photography. For the street photographer out there, this will be a sort of a paradise to get that gritty street angle feel. During weekends and public holidays, people will tend to dress better when going to Orchard Road.

If you are feeling tired and hungry from all that walking, there are plenty of food choices everywhere, and of course, do not forget to get some ice cream from the mobile ice cream stalls all along the pedestrian pavement that will provide some respite from the heat.

Overall, it is a good place to go if you are a first time visitor to Singapore, or if you are in Singapore specifically to do some street photography. I would actually recommend going further out of Orchard Road or elsewhere for better bargains and prices though.",07-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 03:21:57.071389

Depending on the season ie. winter you can even get puffer jackets and ski gear despite the tropical temperatures outside. There is also heaps of food available from super cheap - go to Far East Plaza - to super expensive. ION Orchard is at the 'top' of Orchard Road and is home to big name brands from Europe and America. If you're looking for something a bit more 'Asian' you can try Tangs - which is directly opposite ION. Then you've got a bunch of malls running down both sides of the road until you reach the end at Plaza Singapura which is home to a lot of Japanese brands. You can also just about walk from one end of the road to the other without ever going outside via underpasses; plus there are three MRT or subway stops along the one road - Orchard (ION), Somerset (313), Dhoby Gaut (Plaza Sing). If you're looking for a bit 'character' then head to Emerald Hill (for food and bars and shophouses) - which is about halfway along the road on the same side as Tangs.

This was a three story mall but it contained quite a few cute boutique stores by what appeared to be local designers. Surprisingly these stores were not that expensive ‚Äì about SD$150 for a frock.
The best part of the malls are the food courts. There is broad choice, quality is high and the costs very reasonable.

Both Mandarin Gallery and Paragon houses high end boutiques. The Herren has a large Robinsons department store.

Actually, if you look more carefully there's more to it all - close to the intersection of Scotts Road (Grand Hyatt Hotel and others) and Orchard, at Ion Orchard you will find Cartier, Dior, Dolce & Gabbana clustered with Tiffany and Prada and so many others, you can also find Luck Plaza, several floors of cheap stores whose principal customers are maids and others whose annual salary would probably not be enough to buy one dress or one world-brand watch in Ion Orchard.

If you are a shoppaollic then your eyes will light up like a Christmas tree when you step into that road. It has all the great brands from LV, Guess, MK, Nike,etc., with shops the size of mini malls. Yes that too...lots and lots of different types of shopping malls, great eating spots to sample Singaporean cuisine as well as local supermarkets like Cold Storage where you can shop like the locals. Visiting the supermarkets is perhaps where you may find yourself realizing that Singapore can and most probably is a very expensive place. Fantastic ...however very expensive. And yes I am speaking for myself only coming from South Africa where the Singapore dollar is 10 times stronger than the South African rand. Basic things like bottled water and soft drinks can cost a pretty penny. Again I have to stress that it all depends on how deep your pockets are and what type of traveler you are. There are many other places where you can get good deals and some outlet malls but you just have to ask your hotel. Some of the malls are open till really late and even 24 hours for those insomniacs. The street is designed for tourists so you will never run out of things to do and see. And what's great about this street is that you can walk everywhere. It's like getting a double dose of goodness with retail therapy and exercise...LOL. May for Singapore is a bit of rainy season which is also perfect as it lowers the heat and humidity factors...please note it will still be but not as bad. So if you on your way to Singapore, enjoy your stay and I hope that you brought enough spending money....remember to pase yourself as orchard road is long and lots of shopping to be done.",05-2018,Business,2020-01-30 03:25:23.933435

In this regard, nothing has changed, it is still in the premiere league of consumerism, it remains clean, safe, well organised, safe, secure and often competitively priced if you know where to look.

However, this year I am a little disappointed with the festive street lighting which is in a stark white theme this year. For me, it lacks a little of the spectacular display observed in previous years.

I was disappointed by how much of the charm it had lost. It's overrun with malls that all have the same chain stores in them. All the smokers line the sidewalk to puff so you walk down the street in a haze of fumes and cigarette pollution. The walk from Wheeler Place to Orchard Plaza is a fight through crowds and obnoxious skater packs. I was glad to reach Plaza Singapura and be done with it. I feel that Boat Quay is much more enjoyable to get a taste of Singapore than Orchard; which is a real shame because I used to enjoy that area.",05-2017,Business,2020-01-30 03:26:33.320115

Shops. Many luxury high end LV, Gucci etc with a few cheaper stores such as Sephora, Adidas, Factorie.

The train MRT is located under these malls with main stations for Orchard Rd shops being Orchard and Somerset.

Full levels of food outlets are located either basements or top levels.

Bars are not many so easiest to locate inside a big hotel or look up before you travel.

In fact, you'll want for nothing because everything is available here; food, homewares, clothes, even a train home. And you won't get lost because Singapore is very easy to navigate regardless of language barrier. I'd recommend that you research whether your trip falls near a major holiday, as the shopping centres take any chance to celebrate the dollar. We went around Christmas and there was fanfare and tinsel and fake snow on every windowsill- an eye opening experience.

Sample local coffee at a Kopi Tiam n try local breakfast or pastries.Oxley Road where the first Prime Minister's house is located is quite nearby. The back streets will also offer other surprises such as a Chinese Temple behind Center Point Shopping Mall. In short just let yourself go n wander around the area away from the main street.

There are tons of high and middle end shops, department stores and places to eat, and the walk between buildings/malls is quick enough to avoid overheating, and some buildings are connected so you don't even have to go outside.

If you're looking for a specific store, your best bet is to figure out the building it is in then look in a directory.

It is a happening place as many people go there. The road is one way and full of traffic so pedestrians have to use traffic lights' crossings.

There are lovely displays by the stores advertising their wares so you can stroll along Orchard Road admiring the arrangements as well as fellow strollers (people from all ages and walks of life). Young people: hippy or trendy. Couples, families with young children or babies in prams, mature singles.

Sometimes there's magic in the air as Orchard Road get to doll up with sparkling lights and decos for Christmas. There is also a cineplex in the middle with another cineplex each at both ends. So just imagine the crowds going for shows and coming out to enjoy the cafes and restaurants after shows. Posh hotels like Mandarin, Hilton abounds in this stragetic area.

All in all I would go visit Orchard Road once or twice every year just for window shopping on top of necessary visits for shopping or movies/group lunch celebrations or enjoying participants at big sales by various departmental stores eg Robinsons, Isetan, Espirit etc.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 03:35:51.460722

ION is an upmarket place but also housed with mid-tier shops. The building is sort of divided into 2 wings with the high sreet brands of AX, Zara, Topshop, H&M etc on one part to the more exclusive luxury brands outlets from well-know fashion icons like LVMH, Prada, Gucci, D&G etc in another wing. One can find the latest fashion apparels if you are into shopping.

For the gastronomical, there are a range of affordable food outlets and a food mall at the basement. It has chinese like wantan noodles, famous singapore chicken rice, HK-styled roast meats, muslim food, western and japanese. There are very few high-end restaurants at ION except for a couple of established chinese restaurants like Imperial Treasures but no western fine-dining ones. I would advise to try the food court food as it is one of the largest in town imo and has a good range of local food variety at reasonable prices. The roast meats stall is popular as well as the chicken rice. Do visit more than one time to sample the full range of singapore food here in a nicely air-con, yet not overly-cramped foodcourt compared to other places. I visit the place every other week and never get tired of the food because of the wide variety of choices available. I do like the muslim nasi padang and the nasi bryani very much. As the foodcourt is spacious, one can take you time to savour your food without feeling that you need to rush. So I always enjoy eating there and watching the well-dressed hip people goes by too.

Btw, there are also many luxury watch boutiques here, from the PP, AP, IWC, Omega, Panerai to the authorised dealers. I find it a joy to look at the latest timepieces though they are not always affordable to the masses. But no harm browsing and just enjoy the beauty and character of each watch boutique.

The building is pretty big so take your time if shopping and eating of free and easy nature is in you. I have friends who say there is nothing here but that is because shopping is not their cup of tea and maybe they are too tense working in singapore. I always enjoy dropping by, watching the people and find good food.

Hope to see you there this weekend...........",03-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 03:36:09.652816

Recently made a few trips here to buy Christmas Presents and it was so easy - lots of choice for all budgets and age groups. Lots of sales on.

i prefer to frequent Plaza Singapura as it is more like a shopping centre and so feels like there are less people around in comparison to ION or on the street. There are some nice cafes in Somerset, the department stores are always a good choice and Lucky Plaza for your cheap needs or money exchange.

There‚Äôs something for everyone, whatever your taste or budget. From Cartier and Prada to the more accessible local brands you only need to ask around. Everyone speaks English. The international brands are at Takashimaya, Ion, Tang‚Äôs, Robinson‚Äôs, etc. Local brands are at Metro, Lucky Plaza, 313, OG. Take a walk from the Taka basement level right to Ion shopping mall and the Orchard MRT. This is a fabulous maze of shops of all kinds, from t-shirts to handbags, shoes, make-up, cakes and sandwiches, anything....
Eateries are everywhere and you may well get the impression that people eat all around the clock. Take a break at the food basement in Takashimaya or the top level at Plaza Singapura or Centre Point. These food courts are where you can find a staggering diversity of snacks, meals and drinks (chinese, vietnamese, indian, japanese, thai and more). Coffee shops are hugely popular and new ones seem to sprout every day.

I did not see their server weighing the gelato cups... wow ! guess their servers instinctively know the weight of the amount they give

Yes, it's a road full of malls, but no, they don't all sell the same thing. There are some repeats, but in general each mall has an interesting assortment of different shops and specialty stores. And you can walk to most of them through underground tunnels and avoid the heat and/or rain!

Some highlights for visitors who maybe don't feel the need to go to H&M on their holidays:
Ngee Ann City - Kinokuniya bookstore, Isetan (Japanese supermarket)
Ion - The observation deck, TWG Tea Company
Paragon - Din Tai Fung soup dumplings
Mandarin Gallery - Lots of interesting and fancy little cafes
Orchard Central - The Library, cheap teen clothing
313 - Great food court. Also a place that sells churros, right across the street from cute little Emerald Hill.
Plaza Singapura - Daiso, Art Friend, Several great camera stores.",08-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 03:38:51.878643

Budget hunters should try the food courts where self service is the normal activities locally for delicious local food, like Nasi Lemak, Laksa (a bit spicy white rice noodles cook with coconut juice), Fried Char Kway Teow (rice flat white noodles or yellow noodles), Rojak (mixed Chinese salads with a Malay name mixed in prawn black paste with or without Chilli paste of your choice and top with grind peanuts).
Satay (Barbeque meats like kebab dipped in peanut sauce).

However, it's still really crowded during the weekends and at nights when people go over to find good restaurants for meals or catch up with their friends.

There's just a whole stretch of malls, and I will go down the stretch, letting you know their specialties.

1) Lucky Plaza (right beside Goodwood Park Hotel)
A good place to start. A place for youngsters and some blogshops. One of the cheapest foods you can find in the area, with a nice chicken rice stall at the top and Ayam Penyat Ria. A good standing sushi bar is there as well. If you are looking for variety of clothes at cheap prices, this is the place to go. If not, go for the food, it's cheap and good.

2) Royal Scotts Plaza
High end mall, with designer shops and many nice mid-eats/fine dining places. Not bad brunch place.

3) Tangs Departmental Store
One of the oldest departmental stores with a wide range of shopping. Getting a little obsolete of course. Still can find some good deals here.

4) Orchard Ion
One of the nicest building in the area. Relatively new, can go up to level 55 to catch the top view. Can take underpass to Wheelock Place which has a nice Jap restaurant Sun with Moon and some boutique shops. Nearby is the Shaw Lido for movie watching. Quite a nice theatre.

5) Wisma Atria
Basically from here onwards, the shops get quite similar at every shopping mall. Wisma I would recommend for the Din Tai Fung and the Jap Food Town at the top! This is the passageway to Takashimaya for most people!

6) Takashimaya
Great food at basement. Sometimes great bazaars (u can check their website). Good restaurants upstairs. High end shopping! You can find all your branded stuffs here. Good souvenir stop at the takashimaya departmental store for people who matter more, because it's more expensive.

7) Lucky Plaza
Underpass to Lucky Plaza, slightly dodgy looking place. Very cheap perfumes etc. This is for pirated stuff at a cheaper price. Filled with Phillipinos etc. Great food on top, the Yong Tau Foo is magnificent. One of the better places to buy Singapore souvenirs in bulk.

Very lazy, but the rest is generally the same. You have Paragon (high end shopping), Orchard Central (weird design but really good restaurants here), 313 Somerset (more shopping), Mandarin Gallery (Good brunch places and more shopping) etc etc...Generally the same, shops close about 9plus 10pm so you can walk the stretch down.

Anything later, you can walk to Alley Bar area opposite 313 Somerset, whereby the bars are quite happening at night. Or you can head to Cuppage Plaza to enjoy a cuppa at the starbucks there.

Way too crowded these days and the things are quite similar....",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 03:38:52.984817

While you're there, visit ION Orchard. Go up to the top floor and get to see the view of Orchard Road, from 55 stories up there in the air.

You will get lost! My advise if you see something you like buy it then and there - because the chances of finding the same shop twice are very slim!! Most of the shops are open till 11 pm at which time they start locking doors so getting out of the malls can be something of a challenge - once the underpasses are closed actually getting across Orchard Road its self is almost impossible, they don't have many pedestrian crossings because they slow down the traffic flow too much, but maybe a couple of bridges which do not close would prevent some of the lengthy detours which exist at the moment!",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 03:39:37.884515

Easy starting point is The Paragon Mall. Very diverse with 'big names' on the lower floors, fun places to eat in Basement area and going up some middle range stores and kids stores. Also a big department store (Metro), Marks & Spencer, Toys-R-Us and Muji (Japanese store).
On the corner, just across the road a large Abercrombie & Fitch and opposite the Takashimaya (huge department store)- fun to be there at 10 am when the doors open, all very formal and unusual in Western stores. (I'm told it is very Japanese). Fun to see.
In the Takashimaya mall there are some high end and middle end stores and (Including huge bookstore Kinokunya). One can also walk underground all the way to Ion and Wheelock place (handy when it is pouring down).
Opposite ION is Tangs department store and next to that Lucky Plaza ( & Far East Plaza behind Tangs)- both are the cheaper end stores but good fun malls.
Much further up Orchard Road is Plaza Singapura- a mall suited to shopping for all sorts of stuff (clothing, shoes, groceries, toys, household, cinema, jewellery, music etc).

We then went to the second mall to find the same thing. We did some googling looked at opening times and found they were meant to be open. After doing so much planning we were disappointed at having to wait so long. If we had known we would have re arranged our day.

The shopping centres themselves our lovely there are almost no sales in any stores and you pay the same prices if not more for clothes you could buy at home. It's worth a look but be aware you won't really find anything of good value (we didn't anyway and we went to almost every mall)
