Also there is 15 minute light and sound show at both 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. It becomes very crowded with tourists and locals during the show timings so come a bit early and find a nice place to sit or lie and relax while watching the show.,09-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:03:20.748476

I would recommend getting there at least 30 minutes before the show for good seats. The seating is limited on the benches. And up close is also limited since many people come to sit and watch.

This year we were lucky enough to see the whole show from the ground under the Tree Groves and realized how good it really was my kids absolutely loved it. We laid on the ground in the centre where the big Tress are and it was quite a treat. It is definitely a must visit for first timers. During the day you can see the amazing structure in gardens by the bay for free but if you want to go to the OCBC skyway it's like SGD 8 for adults and SGD 5 for kids. The light show is called Garden Rhapsody and is at 7:45pm and 8:45pm daily and it's free so do try to catch it.,03-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:03:23.306621

So, if you will go to the Gardens, I will highly recommend you to save some time for the Supertree. (While walking on it will need to buy another tickets.)

We bought the tickets together with the Cloud Forest and The Flower Dome. However, we needed to line up again before visiting the Skywalk. The staff gave us another ‚Äòtime slot tickets‚Äô for going up the Tree. And if you are on the walk, you may miss the fantastic light show!!!

If I will go there again, I may not go up. Instead, I will stay down on the ground and enjoy that wonderful show. The music is nice and the whole thing is relaxing. Worth seeing it!",08-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:03:30.117904

I would advise visiting during off peak hours and take time walking on the skywalk and admiring the views. We came during the day on a Monday at 3pm and it was not busy. Tickets can be bought at the entrance at 8 Singapore Dollars. When busy they advise visitors to spend a maximum of 15 minutes. We spent about 30 minutes because there were about 30 other people. The maximum is 80 I think. The skywalk is very high and has a slight swaying motion so might not be a good idea for those who fear hieghts.

It was just as wonderful as we'd hoped - & just what we needed after a busy day (& busy holiday)! We found a spot on the grassy patch as the sun went down, lay down & thoroughly enjoyed the music & lights. Even walking through the Gardens by the Bay afterwards was beautiful.

The best time to visit the Supertree Grove is in the evening as it starts to get dark, around blue hour time. So a good itinerary would be to visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest beforehand (and possibly the ArtScience Museum if you have the energy) and then arrive a the Supertree Grove just before it lights up.

When we visited we arrived just before the 70's Disco Music light show started and geez it was pretty amazing. People were sitting down or lying down all over the place looking up at the trees as the light show progressed. I don't know exactly how long the show lasted but it must have been at least twenty minutes long or maybe half an hour. Tripods, selfie sticks and monopods are allowed here but after carrying a tripod around for a couple of hours we finally didn't use it, plus at the Supertree Grove it does get fairly crowded.

Gardens by the Bay is truly a wonderful place for everyone to visit. There is just so much to see and do and nobody should miss it. The light show at the Supertree Grove was the grand finale and was amazing. Furthermore, the taxi stand is really close and it was easy to get one.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:03:57.987676

Walking around is free, walkways on top will cost you just $8, which, again, in my opinion, is totally worth the price, as you'll enjoy some alternative views of the gardens and the Skypark building.

Worth visiting both during the day when you can see well all the green flowery structure of the ""trees"", and after dark when the lights come on. The place is really crowded for the light show well in advance, so pick your timing wisely.

We managed to go up around 6.15 pm and as the sun was going down the shadows cast were simply stunning. We then went to sit in the open park space (tip bring something to put down on the grass) and just lay down and watch the show.

No need to worry about a good vantage point, everywhere is a good vantage point.
One tip. When it finishes take a breath and look at your phone for 5 minutes, maybe delete some of those rubbish photos you took or choose your favourites for Instagram etc. This will give the crowds a chance to disperse across the bridge or up the stairs where there are inevitable bottle necks.

Although there were already a couple of Supertrees right at the entrance of Gardens by the Bay, but they're not to be confused with this Supertree Groves area. From the ticketing entrance where the two domes are, you have to make a right turn and mild down slope to get to this place.

Rest:
They have numerous benches and a football size grass patch for you to do a little picnic.

Eat:
Granted, if picnic in the unbearably hot weather seems impossible, a stretch of afforbs eateries are along this grove. Think Peach Garden for Chinese, Hill Street cafe for some pretty decent local fare, and Texas Chicken if that's your kinda comfort food. There's Bakerzin on the other side, Satay by the Bay for hawker food, but we just find this stretch of air-conditioned eateries with many seats and good priced is probably better for families.

Enjoy:
Musical light show at 7.45pm or 8.45pm is really quite a sight. You can also be up on the OCBC Skywalk bridge (entrance fee applies) that faces MBS (Marina Bay Sands) when this light show is going on! Sometimes, they have free open air concerts on the garden greens or even the annual payable Christmas Wonderland where they set up wonderful lights, booths, games etc BUT they will close up the entire area to public since it's a payable event.

Big group of us; mixture of adults and young kids thoroughly enjoyed the night.

There are 2 shows a night.. 7.45pm and 8.45pm..duration of 15mins

If you choose the 7.45pm then a nice 15mins stroll along the bay you can also check out Spectra Light and Water Show at 9pm

It is quite a beautiful experience as you wait for the night to get dark, the lights are more visible with Marina Bay Sands in the background.

Tip: do go there at least 30mins early if you want to get a good spot in the middle for the best vantage point.

Personally I love the show perhaps is because I love the music they put on with the lights. They are my genre... my era...

I'm guessing on a clear night with stars in the sky it must be quite amazing too.

Another tip: don't forget to bring your insect/mosquito repellent. A friend of mine recommend the brand 'Off'. Small little spray bottle easily fit into your handbag, pocket and bag pack.

If you are more prepare than us.. bring a small blanket to sit on or lie on..the ground can be a bit warm from the sun during the day. My niece and nephew absolutely loved it.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:05:36.644890

Bring a blanket for the ground and some snacks/drinks, especially if bringing children as there is a bit of a wait before showtime.

Totally worth waiting for. The light sequence and music were spectacular and were totally mesmerising. I would recommend going up to the bridge after the light show to get a bird's eye view of the city and trees at night. You do have to pay extra for this and a tip is to get your tickets before the light show so you can get straight in line for bridge view after the show.

A must when in Singapore :)",07-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:05:37.909493

Admission to Supertree Grove is free but you need tickets for the OCBC Skyway

Thousands of plants including orchids, ferns and tropical flowering climbers are planted on the Supertrees. 11 of the Supertrees have solar cells.

Apparently, this is part of the strategy of turning Singapore from a ‚ÄòGarden city‚Äô to the ‚ÄòCity in a garden'
Lots of greenery like elsewhere in Singapore . There are many sculptures to complement the trees.

Taxis are readily available. There is a McDonalds outlet (which also sells Durian Shake)",07-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:05:38.232730

You can go on to the OCBC skyway - which is an elevated walkway that gives you a great view of the gardens and the surrounding area.

At night there is a light and music show which is stunning to see and hear. The colours of the trees change with the music. It is a sight to behold - and definitely a spectacle to see. There are two shows - one at 7.45 pm and the next one at 8.45 pm.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:05:46.539263

They're impressive to look at and definitely give a relaxed, pleasant feeling to watch, especially as they mix up the music at different times. Aside from the show, these are impressive to look at, but not incredible of their own.

For the show, get there early for a good spot, and then be aware there is a crowd crush leaving so either leave early or better, leave late.

Getting out after the laser show takes some time as every one is trying to get out at the same time. There are taxi stands outside as soon as you get out.

Even in daylight the Supertrees are a sight to see. The design and making of each tree is remarkable and something we had never seen before.
In the night the gigantic metal trees come ""alive"" when different lights and shades illuminate and shade their flowers and greenery.
We recommend doing the OCBC walkway between the Supertrees, especially in the night during the lights-and-sound-show. Visitors are expected to take only 15 minutes doing the walk but it is hard not to dwell longer and admire the show.
Even those who do not, for any reason, do the walkway can really enjoy the show staying on the grounds below, like a lot of people did this night.

I can only describe it as ‚Äúout of this world‚Äù because it looked like a scene from a sci-fi movie. We were very impressed to say the least.

The trees are absolutely massive. There are a total of 18 Supertrees, all located within Bay South Garden at Gardens by the Bay. Among the 18, eleven of which are fitted with solar photolytic system to generate solar energy, providing lighting for the two conservatories located within the attraction. Apart from that, its exposed funnel-shaped top also helps to collect and store rainwater for use in irrigation and waterfall display within the conservatories.

We walked around and took a few pics of the various trees but as it was raining and a bit windy, the skybridge was closed unfortunately.

When we were there we found out that the Super Trees have a light show in the evening so we decided to come back again in the night.

Gardens by the Bay at night is super beautiful as the lights are everywhere. If you think the super trees are cool during the day then you‚Äôll be blown away when you see them at night. The light show are at 7.45 and at 8.45 pm and it energises the trees with electric colours that makes them pulsate and looks amazing.

We just sat on the floor and enjoyed the light show and felt really luckily to have seen it. After the show there were fireworks in the Marina Bay which was superb too.

Overall we had a great time in the garden and I would highly recommend everyone to visit the garden. If you have time start early and stay till the night light and I assure you, you will love it.",02-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:08:00.530423

One of the best skyline by night.. Supertree does suit the name. This man made landmark needs to be seen in the evenings when the lights go on as it looks absolutely amazing at night. You can go up to the bridge but you need to pay an admission fee. However you can always just hang around the bay area itself as this would give you the opportunity to take photos of the nearby Flowerdome and the breathtaking Marina Bay Hotel nearby.. You can walk around the beautiful unique tropical greenery landscape with flora from around the world..There's cactus which I have never seen before..
There's restaurants nearby and this place is for everyone and babies can visit too on strollers.
Convinient to get there by car or public transport. Very clear directions.
Not to be missed...I'll download some shots anyway.. Go see it..Its magnificent. Its one of Singapore's best attractions..",10-2017,Family,2020-01-29 18:08:48.606132

Shows consist of music playing and trees lighted up at the rhythm of famous tunes, but certainly not spectacular in comparison with available technology nowadays, including lasers, projections and fireworks shows. If you want to try the walkway, get your tickets early in the day, as they are sold out very early. The walkay closes at 09:00 PM, very early for a tourist attraction in Singapore, and this leaves lots of tourists stranded on the ground.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-29 18:08:54.861949

We were a little concerned about not having seating, but we just sat down on the ground and it was fine. If you are worried about hygiene than bring a picnic blanket to sit on.

We made the mistake of going back for the 8:45 p.m. 'light show', which was a massive disappointment. For barely 15 minutes, a light is projected on to the trunks of the Supertrees, making colours appear but not in a particularly interesting way. For some reason we assumed the skeletal 'branches' of the Supertrees would light up or there would be laser beams or something, but it's all very dull. What's worse, the venue was very crowded with thousands of other punters, many of whom (like us) cried out in dismay when the 'show' ended (i.e. as if to say 'is that all?'). Then, when you fight you way back down to Bayfront MRT station, you will be forced to queue for MRT tickets unless you have a prepaid pass. It really isn't worth it.

They love going to the Supertrees and the OCBC Skywalk. Its a breathe-taking view and really something so unique! Pictures up on the skywalk are amazing any time of the day!

Tip for the OCBC Skywalk: When you use an OCBC Card to buy an adult ticket, you get a child ticket free! One free child ticket per card.

Hang around for the beautiful light show ""Garden Rhapsody""! The super trees light up and dance in spectacular colours to the beat of awesome music that gets everyone dancing. The Christmas edition till 5 Jan is just beautiful as it ends with the light up of the Dome and a ""snow blizzard"". The kids were tickled pink!

If you are planning to visit soon, check out the Christmas Wonderland Fair, really loads of fun for the kids. Though be prepared that you have to buy the entrance tickets online. Also, be prepared that the tokens are $2 each and each ride is about 3 tokens each. Its definitely an indulgence that I would only allow once a year!

F&B outlets are pricy so pack snacks or a picnic basket instead! If not, I like the peach garden near the super trees, kid friendly, service is good, food is fast and its not that crowded.

1) The evenings can get packed for the light shows at 7:45 and 8:45, so get there 20-30 mins early for a seat. The show is about 15 minutes. if you want to view it from the OCBC walkway you need to get there even earlier.

2) The gardens are free to walk around and marvel at. During the day is less busy. But remember its hot hot hot!

3) You can pay to go into the 'domes'. Each one has an entrance fee. I thought the Cloud Forest with the waterfall was more interesting than the Flower dome. Sometimes they close one or the other for maintenance so check first.

4) The walkway above the main Supertree Grove is worth it for $8 and even though they say you only have 15 minutes, if you go early or during the day, no one will be there to rush you. At night show time it is packed.

5) Don't miss the view of the gardens from the Ce Le Vie restaurant on top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. See my other review for details.

,1,10,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Wizardess1,373748750,17-05-2016,5,Lovely especially the light show,"It was lovely to see during the day, at sunset and after dark. I had planned to do the Skywalk but randomly ended up going up to the IndoChine restaurant, which has 360 degree panoramic views from even higher than the Skywalk, so didn't see the point in doing both.

The light show was great. Definitely try to catch that. When you're watching the light show be careful where you sit though. DO NOT sit where the Skywalk queue is (although this is not very obvious nor signposted in any way). We had a very unpleasant experience due to this and I want to share it so that others can be warned and also if management read the reviews then they can be aware of this issue and this member of staff's unprofessional behaviour.

We went and found a good spot early for the light show. We sat there with our baby for ages without any staff even mentioning anything. Then suddenly just as the show was about to start this member of staff called Queenie said we have to move as she wanted the people in the queue for the Skywalk to sit there. As the light show is a popular time of day, the queue tends to be extra long and extend back way past the barriers.

So she demands that we move (just us, no one else, even though we had been sitting there for ages with a baby) and just before the light show is about to start, so there are no other spots left. So I said to her ""I am happy to move if you can find us another good spot"". To which she replied ""I am not your dog"". Now seriously??! What sort of way is that to speak to a customer when you are in the hospitality business. She then continued to harass us throughout the whole show, telling us rudely to move and shouting at us saying we are ""destroying her queue"". So my husband told her very clearly that the space allocated to this queue is where the barriers are. If the queue has gone further than this then it is not our fault and if this was a problem she should have made us aware when we had sat down, not during the show, which she completely ruined for us.

People in this queue were also watching in disbelief. Not one person actually expected to sit down. They were in a queue. When I am in a queue for something- tickets/ waiting to get on a ride, I don't expect to be seated.

Then she randomly went and got some temporary barriers and put them right in front of us and said ""now you're in my queue"". How childish and pathetic. Someone is obviously getting some sort of power trip from being in charge of a queue.

We think this Queenie particularly targeted us for some reason. She asked the girls next to us ONCE to move, they said no, she left them alone. But she kept on going on and on at us for no reason.

Even after the show ended she kept shouting at my husband and being very aggressive even though he was holding our baby son, coming right up to his face shouting ""you wanna fight me?"" My husband was so annoyed with her that he demanded to speak to her manager.

Now the manager seemed like a professional and reasonable person. She seemed quite embarrassed about her employee's behaviour, especially as she continued to shout at us in front of her manager. So the manager told her to stop shouting and apologised to us (but Queenie did not apologise). The manager seemed to be aware that she has ""issues"". But if that's the case then she shouldn't be allowed to work with the public, especially as she has no idea how to behave with people. I hope this incident is taken seriously by management and not just brushed under the carpet.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-29 18:15:27.443342

The trees are manmade wrapped in flora but beautiful in its own way. It is worth paying the ticket to get on the skywalk that provide a treetop view of the gardens around the grove. It is not recommended for people suffering from vertigo. You take and elevator up one tree and walk on a suspended bridge spanning several trees. You take an elevator down another tree. They limit you to about a 30 minute duration in order to accomodate the people in the queue. Best take the skywalk when the weather is not so hot. A return visit at night when the skywalk is closed as the trees are lit and the crowds are no longer around. The best time to take night pictures.,02-2016,Family,2020-01-29 18:16:02.911603

Entry to the walkway is very well managed and is restricted to a few visitors. The tickets are sold by slots and run out very quickly. Entry is also closed during inclement weather.

An elevator takes you to the walkway and the view of Singapore as well as the rest of the Gardens By The Bay is simply superb.

We could not fault the show at all and found it spectacular. A short 15min show was worth making the trip, but the super grove trees aren't much to rave about in daylight compared to the rest of the gardens!

The Supertrees come alive with an amazing display of lights and sounds at 7.45pm and 8.45pm every night.

Great attraction, day and night.","Why would anyone want to look at a grove of huge, skeletal, metal trees? Is Singapore living out Joni Mitchell's prediction? 'They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum'.

What's it all about? They are a huge work of...what? Engineering? Horticulture? Vision? Imagination? Art?

All of them. I was sceptical. I'm now a convert.

The scale is far beyond what you are prepared for. They....are....huge. As is the amount of greenery growing up inside the massive steel frames. It's almost a shame that in years to come the natural growth will mask the engineering marvel of the skeleton, but that's the magic.

This group of artificial, static monoliths has been given life. They must be very different now to what they were when they were presented to what must have been a doubting public. Unlike other wonders of the world, both ancient and modern, these trees will be constantly changing and something to be revisited again and again. They are standing still and also moving forward.

Visit them now, then come back every few years; they'll be different each time.

Tip: Do research to find the best location to see the evening light show - which is one of the best I've seen. The music and lights are perfectly synchronised; it's better than the nearby Spectra waterside light show and is almost a match for the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas.

But don't get too close (like we did) or while you're looking over here you're missing what's happening over there. (I reckon it's best to go further into the park on the 'non-hotel' side.)",03-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 18:18:27.082838

Was awesome to walk over here as we were staying at Marina Bay Sands , nice and close. Our room over looked this magnificent park. The light show was stunning at night. We walked around the top at night when the light show was on was very cool. We could also see the light show from our room. The gardens are beautifully maintained , the staff working here were lovely. Good price to go in . A MUST to do . Whoever designed this is very very clever. Truly a masterpiece.
We paid $20 each to go up top to the bar area in the supertree this Included a drink. Great view. The service was poor and the drink was 3/4 full and not friendly staff.
We asked the Main man in the restaurant below the bar if there was any tables free as we wanted to have dinner there as we didn't have a booking. He told us to come down in approx 1.5-2hrs hrs as they were full. Even though there were tables empty, we went and had a drink and approx 1 hr came down and tables still empty and i said are there any table free yet seeing for my self those tables were still free and empty. He sighed and said yes he will get one for us , he wasn't really interested at all. He finally got us the table that was empty all night.He poured peoples wine and walked around us and his waitress was just pottering around even though we were at a table waiting to order . Finally the young waitress approached us after approx 15 min. We were not impressed. We ordered a meal each. My husband asked asked about his dish to make sure it wasn't hot and spicy. She said no. When we finally got out meal it was average and not worth the price. His meal was so hot he struggled to eat it and left most of it on the plate. He didn't say anything to her at the time as we were tired and just wanted to get out of there. I said on the way out meal was very disappointing and too hot for my husband even though we asked you about it and i told her the service was poor and she just shrugged. Didn't give a damn. The boss man walked past us a few time while eating and never said a word to us. VERY DISAPPOINTING RESTAURANT AND TERRIBLE SERVICE.

We also did the skywalk. I have a great fear of heights and intense vertigo, but honestly, neither were triggered on the skywalk. It really is not that high. Breeze was amazing and views incredible.

For those wanting to explore the OCBC Skyway (S$8 entrance fee for 15 min),i recommend that you go in the morning or in the afternoon
for pictures (if you want a good shot!) and exploration purposes, if you‚Äôre afraid of heights better just stay on the grounds, the pathway/bridge of the Skyway gets a little shaky while walking.
By 5pm onwards it gets too crowded,everyone (tourist groups as well) comes here to witness the beauty of the illumination

We were lucky enough to have finished our walk, but there were lots of people who hadn't who were ushered back down. The views were great though.",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 18:20:10.231422

The previous year we went to the top of one of the trees for a drink before the show started, there is also a restaurant on the next level down.
The Skywalk had a never ending line of people wanting to walk above the crowd.

What I have told people, and I hope I manage to convey in this review is that Singapore has done something that no city in the world has. In addition to beautiful colonial architecture, Singapore has mixed funky, amazing and modern architecture with luscious, colourful and stunning nature, and the supertrees are a clear example of that.

If you see a structure of iron, you wouldn't be much surprised. Similarly, seeing some climbing plants and flowers would not impress you too much. Now, mix them both, add laser lights, amazing music and you view one of the most extraordinary attractions in the word. It is just so cool, unique that you will see kids, adults and elderly people alike, i.e., lost for words. Head to the trees early if you want to get tickets to Skyway and walk through the trees during the show in the evening. Also, make sure you see the show from different positions, from the top, then just underneath the trees and a little further down. You can then get amazing shots and as there is like a 30 minutes interval between the shows that allows you to walk around and get the different shots.

In the end, if visiting Singapore, make sure you see the light and music show. Just try to arrive on time to organise yourself and make the most of an hour of magic.",08-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 18:22:23.840753

However, coming back at night, the Garden Rhapsody was a delight! If you like movie soundtracks, challenge yourself to identify each song. Pretty easy and a wonderful show for your senses. Just a quick warning for those of you sensitive to mosquitoes: bring repellent for your walk back to the metro station! My friends said there were none, but I am a mosquito magnet and can attest that they are some and very bity! All ok during the day though. (partly repost from my review of Gardens by the Bay)

If you find yourself visiting Singapore, my wife and I would highly recommend day and night visits to the Supertree Grove. (1) It's free, at ground level (2) Stunning backdrop to the Marina Bay Sands and (3) the night show is twice everyday, perfect for timing with the Sands light show.

We paid $6 USD for each adult to walk the OCBC skywalk, absolutely worth it. If you can, visit on a weekday between 11A-3P to see Gardens by the Bay and Supertree Grove with minimal crowds. Our visit coincided with the Chinese New Year, crowds at these times were never an issue. There is a time limit and you'll be kindly moved along if you linger, but we had plenty of time and space to stroll about. The light shows are 7:45P and 8:45P. Arrive at least 20 minutes early if you want a decent view. We went two nights in a row, the first arriving with 10 minutes to opening music and seating was limited to the entrance stairs. Still an amazing show...but on night two we arrived almost 30 minutes early and were perfectly situated under one of the trees. It was pure magic. If you attend the 7:45P, grab coffee and gelato before headed to the Sands light show. This was an excellent way to end our evening before walking back to Pan Pacific Singapore.

We have been fortunate to travel for 10 years. This was one of the best experiences we have ever seen on vacation. Amazing.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 18:24:32.858472

But leaving this sad statement aside, Singapore has made a great example of sustainable development here. They assessed their resources and noticed how much biomass they generated and how much energy that could provide, established a power plant with it and smoothly blend it with nature with these structures.

Every supertree has different functions, some have photovoltaics, some are cooling towers and some release moisture to the environment. Then cover it with plants which will continue the process of producing more biomass and carbon capture (although these little plants do not contribute that much).

The supertrees are also a visual spectacle, during the day the intricate construction and vegetation makes them interesting to watch... But the moment they shine is at night (pun intended).

If you feel a big hungry, do not worry the trees have you covered (pun intended ;) ). All around you will find restaurants, cafes and one Maccas (McDonalds) so you should be fine. There is a restaurant located at the top of one of the trees (or tower) from which you will have a magnificent view of the gardens.

Finally, if you are interested in walking high above the floor, you can buy a ticket to access the sky bridge (or sky something)... it should be from 8 to 12 dollars. I would love to give you feedback about it but we did not go up there.

Yes, these trees are free to see for your eyes, it is the entry to the domes that is charged. So if you are on a very tight budget, you have no excuse to miss this place.
Behind the Marina Bay Sands, these giant Super trees are bound to catch your eye!
They are an architecture marvel and can be stared at for hours together.
They have a light and sound show that happens everyday at 7.45 and 8.45 (again FREE, can you believe it!) which should not be missed at any cost. You will see a crowd starting to gather about 15 mins before, thats your cue. Grab a good spot! (Suggestion: take the ones close to the ticketing counter) and lie down on the floor to ensure you don't miss a single second of the 10 min show.
There is an OCBC skywalk between the trees. That is charged at S$8. Totally worth it. They let you go on for about 15 mins. It is worth every second. An amazing view of the Marina and the Singapore skyline. Again, a night thing, its better with all the lights around. Make sure you view the show from the bottom and not from the skywalk.
It does get super crowded on Sunday evenings, so keep that in mind.

Daytime:

We paid the admission fee and took the elevator up to the walkways which are hanging in the air between the ""treetops"". These are amazing and quite high, so people with vertigo (like myself) might have challenges now and then - but it is absolutely doable, so don't hold back.

The design and layout of the Supertree Grove is well executed and is like a small oasis in this metropolitan city.

Evening:

There are 2 lightshows in the evening - make sure to be there for at least one of them as your will find yourself exposed to a well-orchestrated symphony of light impressions as you walk through the area. If you arrive early, you can even find a place to sit - but strolling is recommendable.

You alight at the MRT stop 'Bayfront' to get here and it is a short walk to the grove itself. Bayfront is right underneath the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Skypark- if you want to visit here at the same time (Or later.)

you can see the Trees from a viewpoint right near the Bayfront exit before you walk down, also.

We arrived at the Grove just as the evening light show was about to start (7:45pm) and the theme was Star Wars. I guess the themes change, but I am not sure how regularly.

This was fab as we love Star Wars. Lights and sounds (Star wars music in this case) were played in time with the light show. Which was fascinating to watch and a lot of fun. It lasts for around 15 minutes and you can stand below or sit nearby and enjoy the show.

There are small stalls to get drinks and ice cream nearby that ring bells to attract attention before and after shows.

You can also visit the restaurant which is at the top of the main Supertree. and do the path between the trees- named the OCBC Skyway as this is the sponsor. This is $8 SGD and closes early evening (around 17:30pm when we were there.)

We didn't do this as we had planned to visit Marina Bay Skypark later in the trip; which is the highest view of the city.

Recommend this sight, it is different and very beautiful, both night and day.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 18:30:35.811436

The supertrees are huge and plants grow on them.
We've already visited the grove 5 years ago, but it was equally impressive to return now, and see the grove grow even more.

Without a restaurant reservation there is a rather steep cover charge minimum for the inside restaurant but not the rooftop area were one can order from the same menu al fresco.

From the ground the skyway didn't look particularly high, but once emerging out of the lift and being confronted with a sign warning that those with high blood pressure and a fear of heights should not proceed, we did have second thoughts as we suffer with both.
We really shouldn't have worried. Once on the skyway the views of the city, the straits of Singapore, the skyline and Marina Bay Sands soon took away any slight fear of looking down. Once we did eventually peer over the edge of the handrail the mass of ferns, palms and other exotic plants below made a stunning sight.

Night is the best time to visit as you get the added benefit of the light show.

Going to look and photograph the Supertrees is free, there is also a free light show at (I believe) 7:45 & 8:45 (but check as the times may change seasonally) which was great.

There are also two paid activities there:
‚Ä¢ the Supertree walk (not available in bad weather) - 8$S
‚Ä¢ the Treetop bar and dinning - 12$S for access and a soft drink / juice, 20$S for access and an alcoholic beverage (food is additional and MAY require a booking)

I personally liked the Treetop bar the best out of these two activities, but they were fairly inexpensive, so I had no problem doing both.

A warning I will give: the restaurant at the top is an IndoChina restaurant - we did have some food there and it was quite good. But there is a trap here. There is a minimum spend of 80$S PER PERSON. For dinner. We were there late afternoon and had a platter which was cost effective and good. If you do this activity I would consider lunch or a late afternoon meal, NOT dinner.

Completely different experience late at night, which was my first introduction to them, lit up with a faint glow, as if they were sleeping against the night sky.

These artificial trees change color, making it a lovely night time activity.

What do I hear? Relaxing classical and jazz music coming from the largest of the trees so I ventured closer to investigate. A noise like wine glasses hitting each other comes through the music occasionally. Ah yes - the base of the largest supertree has the entrance to the elevator that takes you to a rooftop bar. For SD$18 per person you can see for yourself (includes 1 alcoholic drink). The open rooftop bar is quite breezy and very pleasant way to spend a short while here - eating and drinking.

SD$18 per person may be a little on the expensive side but definitely worth going up.

There is a walkway that connects the largest trees and from them you get a sense of the work and planning that has gone into the design of these gardens.
Impressive by day, a light and sound show lights up the Supertrees at night which entertains and amazes. We watched it from across a canal, to avoid the weekend crowds but later joined the crowd as this is not just a show for tourists. At one of the trees, which has a bar and restaurant, a romantic young man had prepared a miniature lightshow of glowsticks at the entrance,to propose to a lucky young lady.

We'd come to see the trees both in the daylight and also to catch the light and music show but literally the second the show started, the heavens opened and the rain fell in sheets. Everyone dashed for cover and we ended up in one of the nearby restaurants where, I'm sorry to say, the food was less than impressive. By the time we came out it was dark and extremely wet underfoot, so we didn't linger.

I've been to this place many times, but I think the trees look most beautiful at night, when the lights are on and they look as pretty and mysterious as ever, shining glamorously on the dark background. I remember visiting them during Christmas time, they came alive with lights, which turned on and off playing in tune with Christmas songs. Hundreds of people sat on the floor, singing, cheering after the songs.

You can go up (with a fee) the 22-metre-high OCBC Skyway that connects two Supertrees to look at the garden from a higher position, though I don't think it's useful since you can see not much further.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-29 18:39:26.840574

You can walk around the base of the trees and watch the light show but you need to pay to ascend the elevated walkway between the trees and it is this vantage point which is best to watch the light show from. During the day you can see the trees and the construction as you walk around but it is at night that they come into their own. We walked over from the Gardens Domes and paid to go up and watch the light show from on top one of the trees. The trees light up and change colour during the light and sound show. We then walked out on the elevated walk way between trees to get different views as it winds around. There is so much to take in and definitely worth the money. Getting back at night was relatively simple as we caught a taxi from the rank just outside. Some people tried to jump cabs as the entered the road in which was just rude.

They did a major investment in designing the rides (including a roller coaster) and detailing all the booths. Buzz, Woody and most of the characters were scattered throughout so lots of photo ops.

I came at night so I missed the Toy Story 4 rides and character visits. However I did get to enjoy the Toy Story 4 sound and light show. It was well done and entertaining, nicely integrated with the super trees.

Beyond the main group was a smaller Silver Grove which was quite educational with a good explanation of how the various sites interact together to form a sustainable ecosystem.

Exploring the area was easy with lots of walking pathways in and around the trees and along the water. Much less people were by the water front.

Next time I hope to get here earlier so I can take in the views from the elevated walkway.",06-2019,Solo,2020-01-29 18:40:23.542320

You should also stay for the evening musical light show, I think at 7.45pm and 8.45pm. I arrived at the Grove around 6.50pm and already, there were crowds of people waiting at the foot of the supertrees. I would suggest however that the better vantage point is actually not at the foot of the trees but find a spot in the gardens overlooking the Grove. That way, you get to see the show without having to get a crick in your neck from looking upwards for the many minutes the show lasts for. If you are coming from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, there is also a platform there from which you can watch the whole Supertree Grove light show from afar. You need to stake out a good spot very early though - if you are late, there will be lots of people in front, making it nigh impossible to see anything much.",08-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 18:41:14.909927

Supertree Grove has 12 and although an impressive and iconic sight during the day, they come into their own at night. The lights start to flicker just before 8.45 and as the sun goes down an amazing sound and light show appears. There are many vantage points but I found positioning myself under the arc of the so called 'OCBC' walkway allowed me to get some outstanding pictures. Also provided some shade from a few showers that passed by. The visuals are awesome but lets not forget these are carefully managed vertical plant gardens with over a mind boggling 16000 plants from all over the world.

They fascinate me---man-made trees with bougainvillea training up the sides 16 stories tall.

As unbelievable as the trees are in the daytime, they are even more spectacular at night. An absolute must-do in when visiting Singapore is to take in the light show every night at 7:45 or 8:45, when the twinkle-lights blink and change color to a tribute to the music of Asia. There are well-loved tunes from almost every country, and you can hear different visitors singing along, depending on where they're from. I'm from the US and of a certain age, and was stunned to hear a Japanese song that was all over the radio during my childhood.

It takes a minute to get to the grove, mostly because there's no path that goes straight there; it's easy to wind up going the exact opposite direction. Also, there aren't many ways over/under the expressway. You can take the skywalk through the Sands, but give yourself beaucoups of time, because the elevators and escalators really jam up. If you're okay with climbing up and down about 80 steps, you can get there pretty quick. Or, you can take the escalators through the mall to the top of the convention center, and get on the skywalk there.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 18:42:00.698051

To catch the first show at 7:45, one should consider get to the Supertree area around 6:30 to secure a good spot. There is a ton of people as one would expect. Don‚Äôt underestimate how many tourists there are even during weekdays!

The gardens are connected with the Marina Bay Sands aka the three-building structure connected by a boat looking garden on top. After the light show, I recommend one go to the Marina Bay Sands.

You can choose to walk up the stairs to the walkway - but why bother when there is a perfectly good lift...
There are notices warning you of a 20 minute time limit up on the walkway - but the 2 staff members up there made no attempt to hurry you along - they did spend most of their time taking photos for visitors. The only thing they did enforce was only going in the one direction - not walking back to the start.
When I went up they did warn me that there was a threat of rain and if lightning was seen anywhere the skyway would be closed without refund. (The rain held off so was OK - but nice to know they had safety paramount, not a good idea being high up on a metal tree in a storm!)

In essence, the Supertrees are vertical gardens with plants growing up and down their trunks, and many creeping plants finding their own way up to the heights of the Supertrees. There is also an elevated walkway in the Supertree Grove that visitors can enjoy for a fee of $8 SGD for adults. The walkway is 22 meters high and 128 meters long, and provides excellent views of the nature park.

One of the key attractions to the Gardens by the Bay that must not be missed in my opinion is the Supertree Rhapsody light show in the evenings. The solar powered Supertrees are used for a beautiful light show set to music that truly is a must see especially for photographers, families and children. I recommend that on weekends and holidays visitors get to the grove early to stake out a spot to watch the show; there not seating per se for the show, one just sits on what benches are available or on the grass. During my visit, many families had packed picnic meals to eat while waiting for the sun to go down and the show to begin. The light show lasts between 10 ‚Äì 15 minutes, and is well worth seeing; children absolutely love the show as do adults.

Currently, the nearest Mass Rapid Transit (MRT/SMRT) station is Bayfront MRT station which is only a very short walk from the Gardens.",05-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 18:44:42.481662

The ""supertrees"" are certainly very innovative. I decided against paying the small fee to walk up on the skywalk connecting a number of the trees. I could appreciate them all at ground level.

However, the imagery of the supertrees in normal daylight pales into insignificance when you see them at night. I returned after dusk and caught the lion's share of the evening ""son et lumiere"" type of event. Here the supertrees are lit up brightly and synchronised to display in line with music being broadcast around the grove. The light show is truly amazing - almost like watching a fireworks display without the bangs.

This is a free show and was very popular when I was there on a Saturday night back in April. Many visitors were sitting on the steps leading down into the grove. You have to step your way through these people to get closer and find some room to watch the show in comfort. There is plenty of space once you have negotiated the stairs sitting brigade.

I didn't do any research about this place beforehand which was a nice surprise. As I was taking long exposure shots of the trees the music began. They started playing Disney songs and the trees came alive. Now I'm a HUGE Disney fan, so to me this was very magical. Great for all ages, if you like that kind of thing.

It is a separate and distinct area of man-made trees now with many many plants of all types growing on and up each tree in the grove. There are some other similar trees at the entrance to the Gardens themselves but this is a designated area where there are a cluster of these cool trees.

One of them has a restaurant at its top, I only saw it but did not go to it, it of course has an elevator.

Three trees have a connected walkway about 40 feet up which allows you to take an elevator up one, walk on the walkway which is suspended from the trees and then go down the elevator at the last tree. There is a separate cost to do this that you queue for. The cost was $8SD. The views and perspectives from above are quite unique and staggering. One thing, the walkway has a little sway to it in the middle and gets narrow, so just be forewarned, nothing too bad or risky or anything like that but just not a solid walkway as I was suspecting. I took a ton of photos from there, as you have clear views of everything nearby, both domes in the Gardens, the Singapore Flyer, as well as the East side of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

Note also that there is a metro stop just near the Grove and the Grove has its own nearby food court with a common seating area but 6 distinct restaurants.

There are also some open areas and grass nearby for just sitting and even picnicking. This is also the prime spot to come and wait for the light show in the Grove each night.

I saw the Grove at about sunset and could not wait there to see either of the two nightly light shows where the Grove ""comes alive"" with lights and music which, by reputation is fantastic. The place was getting packed when I was leaving, since seeing the show is free. Lots of locals, not as many tourists, and many many local families too. Others have reviewed the light and music show, it lasts 15 minutes twice a night.

Also, this is a prefect place to take great Instagram worthy photos of the Grove, the separate trees and the varied many viewpoints also. I surely enjoyed taking photos here and trying to capture the essence of the trees and the Grove itself. I was not alone, everyone there was snapping madly. So make sure you have your phone and/or other camera charged and ready for these spectacular photo ops.

My favorite part was to see something so uniquely creative done so very well. It worked better than envisioned. I am so glad I was able to take it in.

The Grove is about a ten minute walk from the Gardens by the Bay entrance, even closer by taking the Metro.

Don't miss this while in Singapore. A must see.",09-2017,Business,2020-01-29 18:46:36.574911

No, it's not the sound, lights and fireworks that you would see on New Years Eve or at a Disney property, but it is a splendid light and sound show that has the ability to astound the visual and audio senses for a night, or many if you do a return engagement. The folks that put this show together do a wonderful job of choreographing the sound with light movement and it's astounding what they can do when combining both. A technological marvel to be sure. However, perhaps the best part of the whole experience ...... the people. The Supertree Grove show draws in people from all over Singapore and thus from all over the world.

I was struck by how many people watch the show through their phone - they aren't there experiencing it in person! It is much better in real life, your phone is a poor substitute for the lights.

Entry to the Gardens is free and you can stand and wonder at these artificial trees for absolutely nothing. There is a wealth of information available on the boards around the trees and it‚Äôs then that you realise that this is not just a tourist attraction but that the technology and the creativity behind these wonders is staggering. The trees catch the sunlight and convert it to electricity, enabling the whole area to be powered as well as the watering system for all the plants. It is truly amazing.
Visitors can buy a ticket (SGD 8 per adult) to go up to the Skywalk - a walkway between the trees, 22m high. It‚Äôs a lovely thing to do and the views are great. If it‚Äôs busy then the guides do move you along up on the walkway but we were fortunate that it was relatively quiet when we went up.
If you can, do return in the evening for the free Supertree Grove lightshow (this is different to the Marina Bay lightshow). Check in advance for times but when we were there it was 7.45pm and 8.45pm. The current show is called A World of Fantasy and is truly amazing. We were mesmerised by the mix of inspiring music and fantastic lighting wizardry. I had tears rolling down my face - it was so moving.

I fist saw it on David Attenborough's Planet Earth 2 and couldn't believe my eyes. So it was the first pkace we went to once we'd checked into our hotel.
It consists of a couple of dozen massive steel tree frames, each one planted with different flowers, bushes and shrubs. It's one of the world finest vertical gardens.
You can climb up one on a lift and take a boardwalk from tree to tree for a close up view before going down another. Amazing views of the Supertree, the Gardens and the bay and city itself.
Take your time and stroll around them at the base as well. They are truly enchanting, one of the finest sights I have ever seen on my travels.
There's an unmissable sound and light symphony every evening. Do as the locals do, lie on your back and look up to enjoy the show! It is on twice each evening and lasts about 20 minutes. Totally free and is utterly captivating.",07-2017,Friends,2020-01-29 18:52:15.835620

There is a sky bridge about three stories high, need ticket to go up. On the bridge, where the foot is transparent, toucan see the scenery under. When the windly, bridge will shake. If you have fear of heights, you do not go up. Otherwise you not only can not appreciate the scenery but also legs soft down. I personally experienced, and a number of my classmates cried down.

Be sure to have water with you and if you have a small umbrella that you could use as a parasol it would help. This is an arrangement of metal tree structures and gardens. For an additional fee you can go up to catwalks that take you between a few of the structures which gives you a nice elevated view. The structures are covered with plants at their base. Be sure to take time to really look at the plants, they were spectacular. This must be great at night when the trees are lit up.",07-2015,Friends,2020-01-29 18:55:25.109336
