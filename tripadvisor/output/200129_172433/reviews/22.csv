TOP TIP: try and go round the opposite way to the way you are directed. We didn’t realise this is what we’d done but it meant no queues for the pandas (as we entered via the gift shop/exit!). We really loved it here, boat ride was great and so was the river paddle boat. Clearly the pandas are the main draw here and they really are beautiful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 03:42:09.093673

It was really well laid out and the kids enjoyed it. I loved the manatees and the kids loved the pandas. The show was good and even the river cruise was worth it to learn a bit more, as well as seeing some animals from the zoo on the shores.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/SmithySy,736496691,03-01-2020,1,Waste of a lot of time,"Disappointing visit with very long queues multiple times for the main attractions.
Don't waste your money.

First section that takes you through different rivers and the creatures that live in them is quite good although there's not much variety.

Queuing 45 minutes for the panda enclosure where 2 pandas are kept was frustrating as it was known in advance by staff that neither animal could be seen as they were in their inside enclosures. Having seen pandas at Hong Kong's Ocean Park I realise that seeing them can really be a highlight of your trip, so if visitors see these 2, they'd probably think the visit is great. If you can't see them as they're inside, it's just unfortunate. However it's very frustrating that staff don't tell you the pandas can't be seen when they are aware that is the situation. Waiting 45 mins with 2 young kids to see an empty enclosure isn't great.

Then when you get to the actual river safari bit there is another queue with a sign saying it's an hour wait. Since this is the attraction that the whole facility is based on and is heavily advertised, it's a long wait. When we finally got to the front of the queue we were told we had to buy separate tickets to go on the boat. This wasn't clear at the entry and since it is the premise of the whole attraction it seems mad that you have to pay extra to do the one bit that is what the whole facility is about.
We paid and went through the barrier to join another queue for a further 45 mins, then had our tickets checked and finally went through a corridor to find we had to join a third queue which would be another 45 minutes.
Each queue had a sign telling you the wait time. But it is totally misleading because it is the wait time for that section of queue, not the wait time to get in the ride.
It is very poorly managed and completely unfair and misleading.

We eventually got in the boat and the ride promptly broke down so after sitting still for 10 mins we were evacuated by climbing out of the boat onto a narrow ledge at the side of the ride and then stepping across the water into what appeared to be a cleaning equipment area. We were guided back to the front of the queue to join a boat when the ride started another 10 minutes later.

Eventually we did the ride. It was over in about 15 minutes and we managed to see some monkeys and capybaras.
Not worth it at all.

Please don't waste your money on this.
The Night Safari also has long queues but it's worth it for the variety of animals you get to see.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 03:42:09.881158

The tour lets you feed and pet them and even teach you a trick or two on communications with the manatees! And, each participant is also given a free photo plus cute manatee souvenirs after the tour.

Very long queue for Panda exhibit which is normal for the long weekend but both Pandas were not there. This is nature which i can accept but staff should have informed people queuing that the Pandas are asleep and not at thr enclosure so that we can bypass the exhibit.

It is a great place to learn about life in and around great rivers of the world. It is also one of the few places to see pandas.

The free reservoir cruise is little more than a joy ride. There is little chance of seeing birds or animals during the cruise. We spotted some rhinos and giraffes from a distance and that was about it.

The optional Amazon River Quest was more interesting. It may not be easy to spot or take photos of animals or birds while the boat is moving. However, as long as you do not exit, you can go for repeated rides at no extra charge.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 03:42:36.516543

The little monkey forest area was a real highlight, as were the pandas and the otters. We did the River Safari in the afternoon before doing the Night Safari. What we didn't realise was all of the eating places would close as the park was closing (we thought eating places would stay open a bit later) so we were forced to eat at the Night Safari, which cost us precious Night Safari time.

Cute and playful when we went, it entertained us massively with its antics. Located in a temperature controlled area which is another bonus as it is very hot outside, the panda did all sorts of tricks of rolling, climbing, giggling, etc.

The River safari is right next to the zoo and is themed based on major rivers of the world and the aquatic life found in those rivers. You would see the fishes, crocodiles, etc. and at the mid way is the location where the pandas are to be seen. There is a Red panda which can be seen as close as 5 feet and the giant pandas are seen from a healthy distance.

Reservoir cruise takes us to a 30 minute cruise on the reservoir - nothing special other than that it provides an opportunity to sit back and recharge after a lot of walking

The amazon boat ride is nice and lets you see some of the animals via boat ride, however it is too short - about 10 minutes

Another highlight is the ""Once upon a river show"" at 4:30 pm - Very entertaining and fun show that is not to be missed.

Anyhow there is a walkway [ covered with ropes to make queues ] you need to pass to board the boat.
- My mother has health problem and cannot walk much.
- Since there was no queue and no person apart from us, we asked the staff if they can open the rope for my mother so that she has to walk less.
- To our surprise, the staff came to us and said she cannot go in!! I explained the staff the request is to cut the distance short for her (in clear and soft english which they can understand) but the guy (from staff) was on loop mode and kept us telling that she has to move out!!
- At last I was about to loose my cool when other staff members were just looking the scene [ including the member whom we asked intially and was aware of my mother's walking situation ]

Take the boat ride. You don't see much animals, but it is an experience to see the reservoir from inside it. In any case, it is a short ride, and allowed me some time to rest.

Interesting collection of fish, mammals and animals, and whilst we enjoyed the Giant Pandas who live in mountainous bamboo forests, not quite sure why they feature in a zoo based on several of the world's rivers? The 15 min reservoir cruise is pleasant, but you don't see any animals bar a few from distance. Strangely there is an extra charge for 10 min Amazon Cruise and would encourage the management to simply make one inclusive entrance fee and stop this nonsense.

We have done the Zoo and Night Zoo before. Getting here is convenient and cheap. You can take the shuttle from the Khartib MTR station. Cost 1SGD. Most of the way is covered or in shade.
The displays are done nicely. The mix of marine and animal displays also makes for an interesting change. The Chinese restaurant onsite has affordable lunch menus, with nice views to the lake.There is also a small sandwich Kiosk, if you need some nibbles.
Included is a river cruise, very low key, but a nice quiet 15 min interlude.
An add on is the Amazon ride for 5SGD, which has a small thrill factor. Would come here again. At the exit we also made the time pass, before heading back to the city",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 03:43:04.324488
,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/maryyeo,662624512,01-04-2019,5,Extremely kid and elderly friendly attraction,"River Safari is a much younger entity under the Singapore Zoo, and it was definitely well-planned with the young and old in mind. We intentionally chose this place to visit because it is almost entirely covered in shade, and extremely easy to navigate. There is just one route and you just follow that route, which will bring you to at least five themes of river e.g. Amazon River (America), Ganges River (India), Yangtze River (China), Mekong River (Vietnam), etc etc etc, The animal exhibits were were curated and well taken care of.

We even rented two scooters from the front counter, at about sgd20 per scooter for about two hours. The elderly in our family had a great time even though they couldn't walk much. And the little ones enjoyed being in the prams with no bumpy roads, just smooth rides all along. Great family bonding between the very young and old.

The first highlight was definitely the pandas conservatory, as we were able to literally walk into it, on a bridge hanging in the air above their home on the ground. Tip: they are most active at 9am, during breakfast time. Miss that golden timing and you may not be able to catch them at all!

The second highlight were the River Safari boat rides. However, even though the family caught the ride at around 11am, most animals were already hiding and sleeping as it was hot out there. Tough luck. Probably better to come at a not-so-hot timing in Singapore (which is tough too considering Singapore is famous for being hot all year round). Well at least the ride itself was leisurely and enjoyable. Those who are not able to ride the boats (i.e. children below 1 metre) can actually enjoy meeting some animals at the mini stage set up right beside the river boat's ticketing booth. The little ones managed to feed some wombats and pelicans and that was awesome.

The third highlight, and possibly one of the coolest, was their Amazon River aquarium. How very cool to depict the flooded Amazonian Rivers with its seasonal aquatic animals entering and living in the forest, when it's flooded. You can view the manatees both from the aquarium point of view, as well as from above the aquarium. It's true that it's not a full aquarium like the SEAquarium at Sentosa, but hey, it's pretty good enough considering it's only ONE of the many other interesting spots within this River Safari.

There ain't many eateries, but several small ones which were good enough:
- mama panda cafe right after the panda exhibit, great first point of rest for your tired feet with strong air-conditioning
- several ""stores"" all housed in the big tent at the main entrance/exit to this park. They sell local foods, desserts, western and Italian foods, ice-cream, and of course Chinese foods too. No A/C here.
- if all else fails, they still have some small cafes and KFC (with A/C)!",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 03:43:04.717751

We did not pay for that one thinking it was just a wall of tribal art or something. Unfortunately, that meant we ended up missing out on the tapir and other creatures.

Take your time in with the squirrel and black howler monkeys in the Squirrel monkey encounter - the monkeys came up close to us, particularly when there were only a few other people around. Really memorable and great photos!
The Amazon River Ride quest does go by quickly - but you do get the chance to go back for another ride (without having to pay again). We went on it, then went and looked at the pandas and then came back and did the ride again.

It was not a good experience as the animals were kept too far away under extremely dim lighting which did not allow us to spot many animals. My most recent visit was therefore a pleasant surprise. We started with the 40minute tram ride which gives a comprehensive tour of the main attractions of the safari (tigers, lions, elephants, hippos etc). We were a party of 4 adults and 4 young children, so this was a fantastic way to see the zoo. The audio guide was informative, the stops were long enough for us to spot the animals, and the enclosures were well planned and beautiful, allowing visitors a good view of the animals (the lighting was dim but sufficient, a good compromise for the comfort of the nocturnal animals and visitors). Sections of the tram route were open safari, where animals (herbivores of course!) were allowed to roam freely, and we came up close to some of these animals, which was a real treat for the kids. We also went for the Creatures of the Night show and it was extremely enjoyable. The hostess in particular was eloquent, amusing and engaging.

Panda- is one of their main attractions and you can also enjoy a show which is at entrance of river quest and in between many attractions are also there.

You can chill and relax near the water and just see the beautiful sky with sun hiding behind the clouds.

We participated in the River Lockdown game, which is similar to an escape room type game. You receive a game board and will need to complete 6 puzzles to earn the pin. You will have to sign up at the booth upfront and games start every half-hour.

As we've visited RS many times before, viewing the exhibits was not really our top priority so we spent our visit completing the game, which took a little over 2 hours. You can still play the game and view the animals but it can get quite frustrating as you will need to keep going back to the game masters. My family has just recently discovered escape room challenges, so we had a lot of fun completing the lockdown game together. The puzzles are challenging but not unsolvable, the game masters are helpful and it really added a new dimension to our park visit. It is very tiring though, so it is best attempted when rested and alert.

My kids also played the River Games and earned some cool stickers. We waited 15 minutes to catch the red-bellied piranha feeding but it was quite a let down. Apparently captive piranhas don't go into a feeding frenzy like in the movies (LOL) and instead take little nibbles from their meal.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:44:35.909258

That’s fine but when we ask for our boat cruise costs to be credited the response is that you have to use the amount at the gift shop or their food outlets. Naturally they are over priced and may be you didn’t want a toy or food but we got something and when checking out would have been under the credit amount by $2. No cash refund so either forfeit the amount or buy something more expensive.In the end they gave us some money back but if you pay for something the merchant can’t provide then you should get a refund freely. This is a policy that is wrong and I wonder how many people are left with a sour taste as a result. Everything is credit card related now a days so very easy to refund.

(Purchased the tickets through the WRS website which includes other extras at parks like rides). It is a smaller park compared to Singapore Zoo, but right next door, but has other animals you won't see otherwise, panda, red panda, giant otters, manatees and the fish from the rivers of the world.

We went on a weekday and it was not crowded at all which was a nice change.

You would spend 2-4hrs here, depending on the kids if you have them. Overall definitely worth a visit, especially if visiting the night safari after.

Tips:
1. The park is similar to the other zoos and offers water refill stations, so bring your own bottles.
2. There are not many places to go for lunch, basically one place in the middle of the park, Mama Panda, which was average for the price you pay. There is a Starbucks at the entrance, otherwise eat beforehand or take your own lunch.
3. The ride, Amazon River Quest, has height restriction of about 1m. If your child is less than this they won't be allowed on as we found out. So had to go on the ride separately while the other played babysitter. It is not a fast ride, so not sure why the restriction if a parent accompanies them.
4. The boat ride is relaxing but nothing much to write home about. You get to see some giraffes from the adjacent Singapore Zoo from the reservoir though which is the most exciting part.
5. Best way to get here, and to the other zoos, is to get the MRT to Khartib station, then take the zoo shuttle. Note that you should line up for the shuttle as it can get full quickly. Also ensure you have your MRT card, they don't take cash. I think you can buy a ticket for $1 from somewhere in the station though. Saw a couple of people get very annoyed when they were told they could not get on, but if you don't read the sign its your own fault.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:45:00.635335

The River Safari was a very enjoyable experience and deceptively vast. If you don’t study the map, you would think it was was limited.

From the large River Otters to the Red Pandas this park covered a lot of marine and land animals. The aquariums were vast with large variety of fishes.

The Amazon Ride was good and suitable for my young children. We were able to go on this twice as it wasn’t so busy. It’s a shame they charge you for this, in my opinion this should be included in the ticket price. The other river cruise was free but nothing to write home about.

The live shows were also very well organised and far more interactive than I have seen in other parts of the world. They bring out all sorts of creatures such as snakes, lizards and parrots prior to the show for audience to take pictures with. My kids really enjoyed this interaction.

The world rivers which showcased the Amazon, Nile, Ganges as well as others was very interesting but in my opinion I think they could have more here, and perhaps added more feature. Most of the focus was on the Amazon but the other rivers did not feature as much. Overall very informative.

In writing and speech they really seem to value animal well being and conservation. This is admirable.

However, I did not feel they are living to their written philosophy with the panda exhibit. Jai Jai, the female panda, retreated to her concrete enclosure and laid on a metal table in preference to coming out and being exposed to the noise of all the visitors around her enclosure.

I have no doubt Jai Jai probably receives good quality food and the enclosure appears aesthetically pleasing, clean and of a reasonable size but the emotional stress she seems to have from the noise of visitors is not, in my opinion, in the interests of her well being and she seems very tormented by it.

There are signs at her enclosure for visitors to be quiet. However, this is ignored. I spent a number of hours on my visit to WRS River Safari in the panda exhibit and it was NEVER quiet. Many visitors did not respect this and it was rare that a keeper was there to enforce/remind visitors to be quiet. On the occasions when Jai Jai was locked out of her concrete den and forced to be in the tree enclosure so visitors could see her, she looked petrified and paced around and hid in the back corner or stood at the door of the concrete den waiting to be let in.

I found the panda exhibit DISTURBING and I came away encouraged to do something about animal well-being for the wrong reasons.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/sweet_mermaid,628311488,26-10-2018,4,Great variety and well designed - Good for children,"The river safari variety is of course different from the SEA @RWS as the theme is RIVER and not SEA. That said, it means the fish are not as colourful but still interesting, including the upside down fish. Yes there is the species of fish that swim 'upside down'. It is a kind of catfish. Not sure why the Pandas are included but the air-con provided a reprieve on a hot day. Most of the venues are under-shade though so one can still stroll through on a rainy day. Only 1 restaurant that offers not many options for food. Best to eat at the ticket area at the zoo and enter the River Safari again. To do so, remember to obtain a re-entry 'stamp'.
For now, there is a free show, at the boat plaza with free feedings of animals after the shows. (at the zoo, one has to pay (donate) a $5 for feeding). They have the cutest animals for the kids to touch/feed, including the capybaras (huge rodents), America beavers. For touch only, the cutest hedgehog and the bearded red dragon. On different days, they do bring out different animals.

Tips: Go on a weekday that is a non-school holiday and it will be less crowded.
Be seated to the front (go 10-15mins earlier) at the show so you can be the first to 'dash' to queue up for the feeding. Limited to number of carrot sticks or long beans.
Going earlier to get a good seat is not boring as they bring out the red-bearded dragon and parrot for the kids.

If going on the boat river quest (subjected to height and weather), one can run back to take the ride again before exiting. Kids love to go a few rounds.

On a crowded day, consider the walk from the otter/manatees sections first as most will go the standard route by following the River Safari map - River Wonders/Mississippi River.

The Manatees section is the other air-conditioned venue (besides the Panda. Note Pandas section is the coldest), and has seating area for adults to rest while the kids run crazy there. It is quite dim so do look out for the kids as lots of people hang out in this section.

Child-friendly toilets are available at River Safari and their toilets are cleaner than those at the zoo.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:45:10.658686

Amazon boat ride was a big disappointment, passed by what animals were out in about 10 seconds!
Monkey enclosure was ok, did see some up close.

Cruise, River Quest and many more!","We went to River Safari right after the zoo using my Company's premium corporate card which allows 4 incl. Staff. We went on a Wednesday where it wasn't crowded nor too noisy. The map is easy for you to understand, showing that we will go on one direvtion, covering all areas. There are different sections of rivers coming from all around the world, China, India, Europe. Its well organised and so much to discover in each section. There will be no trams, as the routes are quite clear cut and you just need to walk and learn/interact. At the starting point, there will be a touch pool where we can touch a starfish and a horseshoe crab (tho I thought horseshoe crabs are dangerous so I didn't touch that one) Continue discovering and you will see a bridge with beautiful view of our Reservoir before you go on a cruise ride. Take a picture anywhere and everywhere. There is just so much to view. The river cruise is free for corporate cards but the Amazon River Quest tix cost $5/adult and $3/child. The Cruise will take about 15 mins just moving around in the vast waters. There is nothing much you can see except taking photos of landscape and maybe you can spot an eagle up there. You can see the giraffes from the zoo side since the zoo is just next door. I highly recommend the Amazon River quest. It is a designated boat ride thru many open concept enclosures, and that is also where you can see the beautiful cheetah, of course through a glass. There are lots of things to see everywhere while in the boat, not forgetting some fun mini boat slides that the kids will enjoy in between. The animals were spectacular just being themselves. Retail outlets are only available at the start and end of the river safari. There are no foods inside. The pandas Jia Jia and Kai Kai are a blessing in disguise. They are so adorable and the cold huge environment set for them is perfect. We are able to view them in their own enclosure via a high bridge. The animals are well behaved and just beautiful to watch. There is a huge aquarium where you can see all the fishes, otters all in one big full height of a storey

Found it to be better than the next door zoo as everything is just more compact. It is a breeze to move about the place and view the different display and animals. There are plenty of informative signs about different animals everywhere.

The only let down has to be the humidity of the place (which is why it only gets 4 out of 5 for rating). Even with sheltered walkways, it is still quite a challenge to move about in the heat by mid afternoon. So do keep well hydrated.

If planning a day trip, it is best to visit the place early in the morning and treat yourself to a leisure ‘river’ cruise and chill at any of the indoor exhibits after lunch. Apart from the aquarium exhibits, most of the outdoor animals seems to be also less active and themselves hiding from the sun by mid day.

The best thing is the walkways are sheltered from the heat & rain. My least favorite will be the free 15mins big boat ride (40 seats pax) in which we don't see much actions. The exciting part will be the river quest which costs $5, seating in a small boat of 10 pax, providing some thrill & fun (a few gentle falls along the river route) & close up of some interesting animals along a river route.

The riverboat ride is great however if you can't see an animal then you unfortunately you can't just hang around as the boat is continuously moving that would be the only the down side to the river boat ride and its the only way of being able to see the jaguar.

While the Zoo was a pleasant experience, the River Safari has been a disaster. While getting in the ticket checker asked us to go to the right to catch the boat ride.. We searched and wasted close to 30mins going up and down trying to figure out how to get there. There is absolutely no staff around to guide, no signage to lead people to the boat ride. So we went back to the entry point and asked again, and she said go to the right!!

Finally there came a gentleman who said that there is no entry from where we were asked to go. We were then directed to go around and walk for close to 1km to reach the boat ride.

WHY LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS????

On the way we saw Panda exhibits signage but no Panda!!
No one to guide, and no proper signage.

When we reached the boat ride, we had to pay for additional entry fee for the Amazon boat ride. I am not sure why pay again when we didn't find anything worth our ticket money.

I would say 90% come just for the pandas. They are in a nice aircon exhibit and you do get relatively close with chance of a good photo. Used to be a fantastic deal when the pandas were part of the regular zoo.

The rest are pretty standard with various types of river fish and animals. The piranhas are another highlight along with a big crocodile.

The cruise on Mandai lake / reservoir is forgettable. The Amazon River cruise is really not worth the extra charge. Very brief with some sights of monkeys, tapir, capybara and a Jaguar of they aren't all hiding. We got drenched as the tour went on during a down pour.

So, if the kids have seen everything else in the zoo system and you really want to see the pandas then go ahead.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/joshh_c,562335186,23-02-2018,4,Different take on a zoo,"The Singapore River Safari is on the same plot of land as the Zoo and the Night Safari so if you want to visit more than one of these 3 then I suggest you do them back to back as they are NOT accessible by the MRT and you’ll have to get a taxi if you are a tourist and don’t have a car.

First of all the price for the ticket (S$30 for an adult) isn’t too bad.

The layout of the park means that sections are divided by different rivers (Nile, Amazon, Yangtze etc..). Also note that the River Safari operates on a one-way system (although it’s fine to go back).

The River Safari is done by walking through the exhibits. The beginning section is rather mundane (fish, reptiles, rays). However, the first half of the zoo is finished with a visit to the panda enclosure which is a warehouse of sorts. Firstly you walk into the red panda section. The design allows for the red pandas to climb across the visitor walkway between its 2 exhibits. Across the room is the giant panda exhibits which house one male and one female panda (both of which we saw, although sometimes you have to be patient). All in all a very unique experience and one that everyone can enjoy.

After you leave the panda exhibit you walk across a bridge that goes over the reservoir (a very peaceful and tropical 5-minute walk). Here you reach the boat plaza where you have to queue to get onto a boat that takes you on a 15-minute journey within the reservoir on which the zoos sit. The journey was good although the queue was a little long (even at the end of the day).

After this you make your way to the Amazon River Quest ($5 extra charge). Here you queue up and board a small boat that takes you through open air exhibits of tapirs, monkeys, capybaras and flamingoes. You also go through the jaguar exhibit (although this is glass-fronted). All in all the ride lasts 10 minutes but moves a bit too quickly for you to properly enjoy it but there is a free re-ride. We managed to see all the animals and even rode again for the enjoyment. It’s a great way to see the animals and spot them as the monkeys swing above you and tapirs come rather close.

After this, you reach the final section of the zoo which houses giant river otters and the manatees. This is a rarity in zoos and the river safari seems to have a whole family (about 6) so it was very unique to see them.

Last points:
- quite far out from the city
- not accessible from MRT unless you get a taxi from the nearest station
- unique animal collection
- allow 2-3 hours",02-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:48:25.666507
,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/tribe2017,562026937,22-02-2018,5,PANDAS!!!!! Simpler than zoo but still great,"We’d read that the River Safari was a much shorter trip than the zoo and considered doing both in a day. However, the zoo is most definitely a full day trip.

The River Safari is much smaller and is pretty much a clockwise circuit.

You’ll probably get it done in 4hrs Max, depending on how much depth you read all the animal information and set aside for lunch. We took our own packed lunch.

Like the zoo next door, they encourage the use of their water refill stations, so take a bottle along and you won’t have to pay to keep hydrated.

For me, the Pandas were the stand-out. They really are amazing creatures. I was a bit worried at first, as one was hiding and we struggled to see him, but then the female was let out in the other enclosure once staff had left bamboo out. She was very active, roaming her enclosure and then sat and stripped the bamboo and feasted on it!

The red panda was amazing too. Their enclosure is split by a public walkway and it crawls along a branch overhead, allowing for great photo opportunities.

We opted to sit and have our lunch just after the pandas, where there was a bench outside the cunningly placed gift shop. This overlooked the rear of the zoo’s polar bear enclosure. The two places literally back on to one another, so whilst the polar bear isn’t strictly part of River Safari, we still got to see it swimming around, playing with a bit of foam tubing!

The walk-through monkey enclosure was another highlight.

Much shorter and simpler than the zoo but still a must.

Be sure to buy Zoo/River Safari tickets at the same time to enjoy a discount. They don’t have to be used on the same day.

Like my Zoo review, I recommend a cheap way to get here by MRT and then the (I think) 138 bus from bus station opposite MRT. It’s the last stop so can’t be missed.

Hope you enjoy your visit and this was helpful:)",02-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:48:25.976609

If you are planning a two-day trip to the zoo, you can spend the second part of your second day at the River Safari. I believe 3-4 hours at the River Safari will suffice, unless you are the type to read through everything in great deal.
Signages are written in simple language, suitable for children.
There is also a touch pond, a river cruise ferry ride (included in ticket price) and an amazon river quest ($5 for adults and $3 for kids) - a simple boat ride that lets you view animals , comes with 3 small slides along the way, minimum height 1.06 m.
Many areas are sheltered, some enclosures are air-conditioned. So if you encounter wet weather, this is a good place to spend the day.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Nemesisvv,558461172,05-02-2018,5,Always enjoyed it,"I like the River Safari because it is a place that is completely sheltered, so that no weather (unless a tornado or something) will affect you. Well, not 100%, if you are reading this, River Safari, there is one part with the LARGEST Crocodile which requires you to stand in the sun (or rain) and I had to miss that because it was raining very heavily. I only saw the tail of croc from very far away. A shelter will be nice. Just a suggestion.

The rest of it, there are fantastic fishes, some pretty huge. Most of them I am very happy and feel really relax watching them swim and spending a day to chill. However, let me make another suggestion here. There is a tank with huge fishes, I can't remember, but there are african arowana I believe. There is definitely something wrong with the tank. I saw all the fins of the fishes bitten and torn. I suspect there are fighting (maybe due to over-crowding?). I suggest you take a look at it and make some change. No point to make them suffer for our enjoyment.... Shelf them apart or something if necessary. It pains me to see that.

But other than that, all is cool. The pandas are happy and feeding away when I was there and I think the climate control must had been quite some effort, especially in a tropical country like Singapore. I also enjoyed the panda buns, although the price is a bit on the high side, but its nothing to be surprised about at a tourist spot.

I must mention the manatees because that is my favorite spot and I literally can spend the whole day watching them swim (or kind of float effortlessly), feeding and playing. It makes you realized there are still great creatures like these sharing our planet with us and we need to do what we can positively. I had donated quite a bit overseas in the conversations for manatee and visiting the River Safari makes me feel its all worth it. Truly majestic creatures. I wondered if swimming with them is an option, without introducing stresses and all. If it is, I am really interested.

A great day and I think if most people think the River Safari is like a zoo, well they really need to come experience it to understand it.",02-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:48:34.685058

You enter the River Safari at one end and follow the path (which is covered all through, thus making it possible to do on a rainy day—something we were glad of, since it rained all through the day on the day we visited).

The path traces the ecology of several major rivers of the world, through—of course—specimens of the marine fauna of the area—along with other interesting bits of information (like trivia: the Amazon, for instance, dumps as much water in the sea everyday as the Murray—Australia’s largest river—dumps in a year). The rivers that form the focus of the River Safari include the Congo, Mississippi, Ganges, Nile, Amazon, Mekong, Yangtze and Mary.

As you walk along, you see all manner of interesting creatures, both in the water and out: electric eels, stingrays, piranhas, tiger fish, emperor tamarins (monkeys so named because their drooping white moustaches resemble the whiskers of Chinese emperors); spider monkeys (these have their own enclosure, the Spider Monkey Forest, which you enter after making sure you’ve packed away any food and drink); and more. There are turtles, there’s a special section where you can touch starfish and horseshoe crabs (after and before washing your hands at the wash basins beside this!), and there’s a huge tank with lots of manatees and other massive freshwater fish and mammals.

Two other attractions are part of this: one is a fifteen minute boat ride over the reservoir that lies beside the River Safari; the other is the Amazon River Conquest. The latter, on the day we visited, happened to be closed, so we were told that we could use the S$13 for it that was part of our park ticket to buy anything of equal value either at the souvenir shops or the River Safari’s own eateries (not the external eateries, like Starbucks or Ben & Jerry’s). This we did, purchasing a cute book about giant pandas for our toddler.

The river cruises were delayed for a while because of heavy rain, but once the rain eased off a bit, they restarted, so we went on a cruise. This is a short one—a little too short—but it’s still fun.

All in all, an enjoyable experience, and informative as well. Plus, since it isn’t as huge as the zoo, it’s also easier to do and takes less time. And—unlike the zoo, which is open to the skies in most places—this is covered, so can be done even when it’s raining.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:48:35.412254

1. See the Pandas (made me super happy!)
2. River Safari Cruise - 15 mins ride. Nothing exciting but we liked the fact that you can see some animals in the zoo while cruising. We didn't have to wait for the boat as we went on a weekday. Don't go on weekends.
3. Amazon River Quest - 10mins ride. Aside from the pandas- this is probably the highlight. It felt like cruising along a rainforest while you spot some of the animals like the Brazilian tapir, jaguar etc.

You can do this in 2.5 hours so it's best to go around 2-3pm before you proceed to the night safari which is right next door.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 03:48:35.848613

It includes entrance fee as well as the Amazon river quest cruise which is chargeable. In all, I paid only sgd 64 for a family of 4 for a day out at River Safari. If u were to purchase the same tickets at the counter, it would cost u sgd 116 (sgd 30 per adult, sgd 20 per kid, sgd 5 per adult for river quest cruise, sgd 3 per kid for river quest cruise).

Redemption of tickets were easy.
The staff at the river safari were very helpful too.
So I would highly recommend u to purchase ur tickets via qoo10.

Honestly, it is a pretty small park. U can finish the whole park within 3 hours if there is no long q for the free cruise (which is a complete waste of time) and the amazon river quest cruise.

Bcos the free cruise is a complete waste of time, I would suggest to skip it. Heres why. If u r lucky, u will get to see from afar 2 animals from the Singapore zoo - rhinocero and giraffe. Otherwise, u get to see only the giraffe. Other than that, u see mangroves. I wasted 15 mins queuing for the cruise and another 15 mins for the ride looking at the difference between a human hair and a giraffe as well as an upclose and personal look at the giraffe's poop.

I personally would rather spend more time on the shows as well as the river quest cruise which is situated right beside the free cruise.

Although the ride is a bit fast, u can always q again for a re ride. Q clears pretty fast so I went for my second. I could go for the third but it started to drizzle and so I left. My kids had the best time at this station.

The park is very well kept. Aquariums are clean and clear and it's very informative. I've learnt a lot seriously...

We stopped by the panda restaurant for their signature bun. $2.90 for a bun and I think it's reasonably given its size and cute appearance. Taste wise... erm... I don't like it.

I thought the food is not as expensive as compared to the normal standard of Singapore given that this is a tourist attraction. However, stay away from its coffee. It's sgd 5.50 for a cup of black coffee with sugar. I might as well get my dose from Starbucks located at the entrance.

All in all, I enjoyed my day at the park but would not go back again any time soon.

There is a 15 minute cruise which is rubbish to say the least. All that the river cruise is all about sitting in a boat and go around the river. The reptiles, animals they expect you to see are so small that you wouldn’t see them even otherwise. So all in all, it’s not at all worth it.

Yes, then there are exhibits with a lot of fishes and marine animals from rivers all around the world. This is definitely good and educational.

The pandas are good to watch. At first you may not see them because they are in their den. But just be patient and they will come out. Watching Kia Kia eat bamboo was amazing. The red panda is super cute. Best time to see them is they are being fed. Ask any staff for the time.

The manatees did save the rating being even lower and this is the only way you can get to see the zoo pandas and polar bear.

The first part of the visit is devoted to the various river themed aquaria. Unfortunately river fish are not a interesting as the marine counterparts and therefore it is a little lacklustre, particularly if you have seen crocodile in the wild.
The actual safari 'cruise' takes place on a glorified theme park ride, starting with a water splash. The trail is too fast and there is little time (if any) to spot the animals being described.
The latter part of the visit was markedly more interesting and you can watch otters playing with stones in their enclosure (and underwater), plus you get to meet the zoo's pandas (if they interest you at all) and the aged polar bear. I always feel polar bears have no place in zoos, particularly in the tropics, but this one is well cared for and appears happy and despite arthritis has outlived natural members of the group.

The river safari consists of a lot of walking round displays and a short 10 minute boat trip which is not worth the 1 hour queue.

The first half of the River safari is not very exciting, it has lots of displays of fish and a long walk through them. The long walk leads you to the panda enclosure which is good. It was big and the panda is always close. The river safari is next, the 1 hour queue was not worth the 10 min boat trip where we saw two animals from the zoo and a large tree. The walk back to the start was better with a lot more large aquariums that went over head and more exciting animals, for example otters and big fish.

Most of the ""big"" attractions in there (the amazon river quest, the pandas and the river safari) had elaborate crowd channeling devices in place, as if they expected huge lines and decent waits. However we didn't have to wait to see anything and pretty much everything is under cover, except the two rides, but some judicious timing with short lines made that a non-issue.

The giant fish are a sight to behold, the tanks are enormous and there is ample above and below the water line viewing to allow you to take in the full majesty of the critters.

I loved watching the antics of the otters and would have happily spent hours there, but there was so much more to see.

The giant pandas appear to be quite content in their air-conditioned abodes, munching more or less non-stop on bamboo and the red-panda with his over the walkway branch between enclosures was a delight.

The manatees share their space with some truly enormous fish but that doesn't appear to bother them in the slightest, the baby seemed to take delight in crashing into some of the staid old fish cruising around. (The fish were less happy about the whole affair ;-))

The only creature that didn't appear to be fully content in it's enclosure was the polar bear, maybe he/she needs a buddy?

The Amazon River Quest is a neat little amusement park style ride with a english only commentary about the critters you see as you go. The river safari ride itself was relaxing I guess, but unless we were really unlucky and missed everything it wasn't worth the effort. You'll get a much better view of the few animals it shows you if you visit the Singapore Zoo itself.

The food here is crazy expensive for Singapore, food court style food at 5 times the price, but it's at least tasty.

There are a bazillion deals and sites and coupons available for visiting this place, so do a little research before you go and save some cash on the entry price to offset the food :-)",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 03:49:09.403480

It has air conditioned areas in some of its exhibits to give you a break from the heat. Since it focuses on just the animals found in the major rivers of the world, it’s not too big and so you can finish it half the time or even less than the time you would spend in the Singapore Zoo. If you get too tired and are not in a rush, there is a cruise within the area to get some air and just chill and relax. The panda exhibit is a plus. And don’t miss the river ride. It’s like a theme-park ride in the forest. Thrilling enough at the same time educational and interesting. It’s enough experience for those with smaller children and maybe for the older citizens.

The River Safari offers a good mix of indoor and out door attraction to cool you from the heat and at the same time, immerse you in the tropical heat of the wilderness. The close encounters with some of the Amazonia River Monkeys was an experience that is both enriching and at the same time, ""cute"" for the family.
One attraction did leave a scar in my trip this time around as my Son was looking forward now, that he has grown taller - during the last trip he was only 90cm. We have measured my son at the doctor for this trip and he stands at a good 108cm and thus we purchased the tickets. However, when I reach the Amazon River Quest site, we were stopped at the door and was told that my Son was not tall enough. When asked politely for the reason, we were shown the height ruler at the side and it has a marker to denote the minimum height requirement. It was obviously higher than 1.06m!
We did not create a scene, being law abiding people, and walk away disappointed. We took the River Cruise instead, much to the disappointment of my Son, who queried why is he not allowed entry after he has fulfiled his promised of eating his meals regularly, studying hard and also exercising to grow taller. I could not answer him. It was truly a disappointment as this was meant as the first stop of his Christmas tours leading up to the big Xmas party that we have planned.",11-2017,Family,2020-01-30 03:49:29.441768

The fresh water fish and reptiles exhibits were intriguing and the group tour extremely informative. It's not every day that one gets to see what creatures lurk in the Mekong and Amazon rivers! Some of them are really enormous!

The pandas were really cute but I kept imagining that it was someone in costume!

We took the Amazon quest boat ride which was an additional small fee. It was a really quick 5min ride but worthwhile if the animals aren't hiding from the heat. You are allowed to go on the ride as many times as you wish.. so we went twice.

It was on this ride, however, which I encountered one of the saddest displays... it was the regal jaguar pacing up and down the maybe 80m length of its enclosure. First time round, we oohed and aahed... but it didn't take long to realize it seemed so trapped.. the top of the enclosure had metal fencing about 2m high overhead. Claustrophobic for an animal capable of great speeds and swimming prowess.. and used to roaming square kilometers of land.

Of course, probably born captive, it would never have tasted such freedom, but would it not be in its very DNA to leap, sprint and hunt? But tragically, it would probably not survive long if released in the wild.

My 6year old asked me who takes it out on walks and runs!

Ditto the manatees in the huge aquarium near the exit. The tank is big, but is it really big enough for all those huge beasts? I just hope the manatees have the memory of a goldfish.

So, as a tourist attraction, the place is great... interesting, clean, worth a visit for families.

But as an animal lover and maybe one wont to anthropomorphize, I find it a little depressing and will not be planning another visit.",11-2017,Family,2020-01-30 03:49:36.717602

Our favourite spots are the Panda Bears and Squirrel Monkey Forest. We have been lucky to catch both Pandas in action on our past 2 visits.

The restaurant after the Pandas is a strategic stop point where we enjoy eating the Panda steam buns before heading to the cruise on Seletar reservoir. We were fortunate to have 3 giraffes looking at our boat as we drifted by!

We bought 4 in 1 ticket package on the spot at Singapore Zoo. After spending 4 hours or so at the zoo, we walked to River Safari - only 2 minutes walk.

Size wise, it's a lot smaller compare to Singapore Zoo and just the one route to follow. Most of the River Safari walkways were undercover which came handy when it's raining.

River Safari covered all the famous rivers of the worlds; Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mary, Mekong, Yangtze, Amazon.

We bought the Amazon River Quest tickets on the spot but just as we about to start, it rained cats and dogs. The staff were very kind to informed us if we'd like to proceed the 10 minutes quest which was outdoor, no under cover areas. We waited and cancelled as the rain lasted 2 hours. The tickets were credited towards the restaurant (or the souvenir shop). We opted for the restaurant, we had chicken ramen, beef ramen, chicken nugget and panda bun - the meal were tasty but not cheap. No $2.80 meal here ha ha!

Recently we came to know the tickets for kids are waived off for this month , hence we took the plunge of visiting river safari yesterday .

This park is located right next to Singapore Zoo and night safari . To reach the same mode of transport will work .

The park has a open atmosphere and is not as crowded as Singapore Zoo or night safari , hence giving good experience .

At the entry we start with Mississippi River trail where we get to see alligator snapping turtle , alligator gar. Then we move into Congo/ Nile river trial the main attractions are African dwarf crocodile, tiger fish , Congo tetra, giant puffer fish . The next we move onto Ganges river where we get to see a huge Indian ghariyal. We quickly criss river Mary of Australia .

We then enter the giant enclosure of Mekong river , where we get to see giant Mekong cat fish, giant stingray . The enclosure is massive and is wonderful.

Then we get to see the main attraction of the park is the giant pandas , they are named Jia Jia and Kai Kai . We have never seen this majestic creatures before , so we were thrilled to see them and were struck in awe of these creatures.

We then went on both of the boat rides , which was very pleasant and finished it with the amazon animals .

We thoroughly enjoyed the visit , was slightly shorter than we expected , but was over all a fulfilling experience .",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 03:50:21.482504

The marine part was still worth seeing and the area was under air conditioning, but it was hor to go through the rest, and I'm not too sure why the panda were not placed at the Singapore zoo instead.

Second - carry water and hats though a lot of the exhibits are indoors. The safari takes you through the great rivers of the world in a thoughtfully planned path.

Third - children and adults will both enjoy this place if they know what they are going for - it is a river safari not a safari on river - at the end you will leave the place knowing a lot of interesting facts about the great rivers from around the world.

Fourth - cruise or amazon boat ride? We chose amazon boat ride as the other reviews advised us to. The river cruise is just that - a cruise in the river, or so I read in the reviews here. The amazon boat ride is a short fun extra to experience a bit of what comes to mind when one thinks of ""river safari"".
Fifth - the pandas are great - because they are in a big air conditioned enclosure - means we get a much needed respite from the heat and get to spend time admiring the bamboo eaters.
Finally - a great way to spend two hours. It is better to visit in the second half of the day to avoid the extreme heat that we experienced between 1 pm to 3 pm. While leaving we wished we had arrived at around 4 pm. The views of the river and the animals are great.

The restaurants outside of the park in the main area need to be clearer in their advertising that they all close at 6pm.

As everything else in Singapore, it is well organised, well controlled and in perfect condition. We thought that we would do the River Safari as we have done zoos before and thought that we would try something different. There is a lot of interesting information to read and most of it is in English and there is a lot around protecting our rivers. It focuses on the world's biggest rivers and there are numerous water tanks showing all kinds of fish from piranha's to Asian crocodiles. Most of the tanks are quite spacious and laid out really well. Some of the fish are HUGE and amazing to see. The other benefit of this trail is that you see the pandas half way around and they are a delight to see. After the pandas there are toilets and refreshments. You then walk across a bridge and can get on the river cruise on the pier down on the left. It only takes 40 at a time but runs regularly. You get to see some of the animals from the zoo such as giraffes and elephants (if you are lucky). There is another mini boat ride that you can do near there but you have to buy tickets. It is very cheap and worth doing as you see a lot of other interesting creatures. Walking back you see other animals and our favourite was the monkey cage where you walk amongst spider monkeys that leap from branch to branch.

There are lots to read and learn about the fishes that we don't normally encounter in our daily lives and to read about the role rivers play in the whole ecology.
What i really like is that it's mostly indoors and sheltered, which makes for a good stroll with kids and they won't get antsy quickly.
The pandas are like a distraction from all the fishes, but they are adorable :)

There's a ride within River Safari, called Amazon Quest. $5 for adults, $3 for kids. unlimited rides. I thought this was quite worth it, although it's a small circuit, but it's fun for the kids with some animals for the camera-clicking adult.

Some of the larger and in some cases rarer creatures include the alligator snapping turtle, giant salamander and Mekong giant catfish. The manatee exhibit is very good, and the panda exhibit allows visitors a good close look at the pandas without a glass barrier. One tip, though: do not pay the extra S$11 for the Amazon River Quest, which is just past the halfway point of the park. It's not the money I object to, it's the fact that the boats in which visitors ride move too fast and therefore do not allow a decent look at the exhibits along the waterway. The 2-for-1 Park Hopper deal available online from the Singapore Zoo is good value if you have slightly old children. We visited the River Safari before stopping for a meal and then viewing the Night Safari. If you take that approach, the Park Hopper deal gives you the second park for only about $30 more than the full price of the Night Safari.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 03:51:15.921517

The place is full of marine life. Have been to SEA Aquarium many times (my daughter is an expert at sea creatures through books and the cartoon series Octonaughts). This place was similar in many ways and yet had some things unique.
The walk along is not taxing. If u have young children and elderly, it's very easy to take them along. The only issue we had was the restrooms. There is one at the entrance and the next one only after visiting the Panda.
I will strongly recommend this place as it's value for money. Btw don't compare this place with zoo and night safari. It's animals vs marine life.

Start with the zoo, cover the morning shows followed by the afternoon feeding trail - don't miss the hippo, giraffe feeding which the kids love. Move onto river safari after a quick lunch for walkabout seeing the pandas and doing the amazon ride. Have an early dinner and do the fire show along with the first show for creatures of the night. Some of the later shows get full. Once exhausted, sit on the tram and do a full round.

There is no tram rides so a PRAM is a necessity is bringing young children as the walk is very long.

If you look at the map of River Safari, it clearly has two parts - as you enter on the left you've animals from major rivers of the world except Amazon and on the right, it's all about Amazon, which makes sense because of the diverse animal life the Amazon river has to offer.

The fresh water animals which I was really impressed with while moving from one river to another were the ""Alligator Snapping Turtle"", ""Alligator Gar"" and the the weird looking ""Mississippi Paddlefish"" from the river ""Mississippi"", the ""Giant Puffer fish"", ""African Dwarf Crocodile"", ""Congo Tetra"" from the river ""Congo"", the ""Bottlenose Mormyrid"" (Elephant fish), ""Tiger Fish"" (Piranhas of Africa) and ""Giraffe Cat fish"" from the river ""Nile"".

The pair of ""Indian Gharial"" (Ganges Crocodile) in the ""Ganges"" river aquarium were really massive - the biggest I've seen. The ""Mud Skipper"" (which can live both on land and water) from ""Mary"" river, ""Mekong Giant Cat Fish"", ""Giant Siamese Carp"" (the largest of all carps and national fish of Cambodia), ""Giant Freshwater Stringray"" (discovered only about 20 years ago), ""Elephant Trunk Snake"" from the ""Mekong"" river and the ""Chinese Great Salamander"", ""Fire Bellied Newt"", ""Big Headed Turtle"" and ""Sturgeons"" from the ""Yangtze"" were again some of the aquatic life I've only read about but was very excited to see them live.

After visiting the seven rivers, we came to the ""Panda Forest"" to see ""Kai Kai"" and ""Jia Jia"". Though we've seen lots of pictures/videos of Giant Panda and off course our beloved ""Kungfu Pana"", but I didn't expect the Pandas to be actually that big. Time yourself with their feeding time, to get the best of the Giant Pandas. However as you enter the ""Panda Forest"", unless it is sleeping you can't miss the more elusive in the wild - the ""Red Panda"" continuously tottering around from one tree branch to another.

Coming out of ""Panda Forest"" and picking up some souvenirs we crossed the lake water inlet and reached the other side and went for the ""River Safari Cruise"". This boat ride on the lake actually lets you relax and take glimpse of a lot of aquatic birds and even the animals from the other zoos near the shore of the lake, like we spotted the Asiatic Elephants which were not part of ""River Safari"". However if you are short of time, you can skip this ride as it doesn't have anything extra to offer.

Finally moving to ""Amazon"" river, the first attraction is the additionally paid ""Amazon River Quest"", which is an expensive boat ride through the Amazonian jungle themed park and we got chance to see the Kapybaras, sleeping Jaguars, Crimson Ibis, Spider Monkey. There are other animals and birds also along this boat ride, however the boat moves too fast to be able to spot them. Either the zoo authority should reduce the speed at which the boat moves or they should allow the boat to take double or reverse turn so that visitors have more chance to spot some of the rare animals which are kept here but can't be seen while walking across the zoo. Taking photographs is also difficult so we opted to take video.

Out of the ""Amazon River Quest"" as you walk along, you find variety of Amazonian animals, some of which we've hardly heard the names of, like - a pair of ""Jaguarundi"" (a wild cat smaller than a Jaguar but much larger the domestic cats), ""Green Anaconda"" or the ""Silver Arowana fish"" - which can be up to 1.2 meters, are able to leap out of water to snatch prey from overhanging branches. You can catch them in action during feeding. Alas we missed the opportunity.

While walking along, you'll find the entrance to ""Squirrel Monkey Forest"" which is optional, but I would recommend you to go inside as they are really a funny lot and there are probably more than 30 of them kept in the open space and the adorable ""Squirrel Monkeys"" will walk past you or swing on top of your head. Watching the mischief of these monkeys from close quarters is a real treat and will give you ample opportunity to take photographs/selfies with the ""Squirrel Monkeys"".

The last destination is the ""Amazon Flooded Forest"" which has number of exotic aquatic animals like - ""Black knife Ghost fish"", ""Mata Mata"" (turtle), ""Electric Eel"" (which is not a true eel and can generate electrical charge of up to 600 volts), ""Red-Bellied Piranha"", ""Arapaima fish"", and finally ""Amazonian Manatees"" (or Sea Cows).

We spend around 4 hours at the ""River Safari"" and really had a good time. Couple of things which we felt could have been better are, of course one which I mentioned earlier - increasing the time or slowing the speed of the ""Amazon River Quest"". We also found the size of the aquariums or enclosures of some of the animals are quite small and should be made bigger, like that of the ""Indian Gharials"" or ""the Jaguarundis"".

If you've visited the ""Singapore Zoo"", ""Jurong Bird Park"", ""S.E.A Aquarium"" and the ""Universal Studios"" and still have half a day to spare, then I'll surely recommend you to visit ""River Safari"".",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:51:45.049129

The river safari is not quite big but you will definitely enjoy and have fun there. I found that it is a great place for family, for both old and young (my son is 2 years old).

The Amazon Quest is fun. It is a 10-minute boat ride with about 10 people sitting inside the boat. You will have a closer access to the animals during the ride. However, only kids with above 106cm of height are allowed for taking this ride. You may consider joining river cruise which is free of charge. This is a 15-minute ride with 40 people sitting together and is safer for even small kids.

My husband is so excited when he first saw polar bear in Singapore! Also, the panda!! There are 2 pandas in the river safari, namely Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They are just so adorable ... You can't missed the panda restaurant selling the cappuccino with panda image on the milk foam and their signature red bean bun comes in the look of panda.

You may take a stroll at the monkey forest. If you are lucky enough, you may have a chance to spot the monkeys walking in front of behind you! Also the crocodile farm, the giraffes, elephants, hippos, jaguars, flamingos, and many many more.

The river safari opens from 10am to 7pm daily. If your body do allow, you can continue exploring at the night safari which is just next to the river safari.

There is also a theme park ride called Amazon river quest which was lovely. The one thing we should have given a miss was the River safari cruise. The board said it would be a 40 min wait. We thought we will give it a shot & waited. It took 80 mins before we could board one of the 2 boats that were taking tourists on the 15min ride.

We had a really hot day and there weren't many people there which made it better for our family (2A, 2K - 10 & 12)
The river cruise (included in the entry price) was a little lame and the novelty of the boat ride wore off with the kids pretty quickly (even though it is only 15 minutes).
The Amazon river cruise was a little extra (S$5A S$3K). You can go several times but have to exit and rejoin the queue. This goes for around 10 minutes and was just too fast to enjoy and you couldn't see many of the animals (but this could have been the time of day for us)
The Panda's are a highlight (and the exhibit is refreshingly cool away from the heat) and the Otters are amazing to watch when they are swimming.

- Animals were not as spectacular as in the Zoo (and we could hardly see the pandas).
- River cruise was a 30 min queue (though 15 minutes was displayed) for a very quick cruise around a river with no animals to see except the ones from the zoo

Maybe the only interesting attraction was the Amazon Cruise (with additional fees).

- unique experience for offering a boat tour thru river and mechanical boat tour while seeing animal thru amazon quest
- you can see panda and red panda
- you also can see dugong, giant cat fish, alligator fish, small anaconda
- giant aquarium to see dugong and another river fish

cons
- the river boat tour not showing anything besides few girrafe and rhinos further away at the zoo. that is nothing more! while we need to wait nearly 40 minutes to get the boat!
- the amazing quest should be fun because we can see animal closer. but during my trip we're not seeing many monkey here. while the trip is just too short.
- you need to pay extra to get amazon ride!
- there are certain height limit for your kids before taking ride on river cruise and amazon ride
- walking thru river safari feel much shorter and smaller than regular zoo
- there's a section while we can walk and see the monkey closer. i dont see many monkey available. not sure if that because we came at daylight (around 1pm) or not many monkey available in park

We thought there would be a boat ride going through the park, but it is actually all walking / walk-in exhibits. There is a boat ride in a large pontoon in the adjoining fresh water lake (singapore's drinking water reserve), but it lasts only 15 mins and mainly just a float around with some interesting trivia on the plants growing on the sides of the lake.

I didn't really know what to expect though. What's a river safari? Do you walk or ride down the river?

Well, first of all, this park is located in north part of Singapore, kind of away from downtown. There's no easy way to get here, and you need to take a combination of subway and buses, or two buses, to get here.

For the most part, you walk through this attraction. You follow a path that shows you some animals you may encounter through different continent's river systems. It's not very comprehensive. You just see a few animals here and there. Near the end of going down to the lake, you go into a panda exhibit. Now, this was something different, and worth the price of admission if you have kids who love panda. Instead of watching them behind glass, here you can see the two pandas from a bridge overlook. Depending on what they are doing, you can get an up close look at them. Since it's air-conditioned, it's also a nice respite from the heat.

After that, it's a 5-minute walk to the lake front, and you can wait for the boat ride on the lake. Now, this is totally boring. Except a glimpse or two of animals in the Singapore Zoo, this ride doesn't really show you much. If your legs are tired, I supposed it's a good break.

Next to the lake/reservoir boat ride is another optional boat ride. This one you have to pay, and it claims you can see jaguars. Well, we didn't see any jaguar, or half of the animals they claim you could see. You wind through this tiny stream on a boat, and hope you can catch glimpse of some animals. This was kind of a disappointment.

At least the last part of this was kind of interesting. You finally end up in a large building, with a large tank. Similar to an aquarium, you see some supposed fresh-water animals. Beavers are kind of interesting, and manatees are big and slow moving.

Overall I would say it's a mixed bag. There's enough walking that I'm not sure I would do this and another attraction on the same day.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:52:36.954860

It’s entrance is right next to the entrance of Singapore Zoo so better plan visiting both on the same day as they are away from the city and it’s quite a long ride to get there. You can also reach the placi by one of the hop-on hop-off routes. Otherwise taxi ride is the fastest way to get there.
It’s also worth to take the boat ride there (normally there is an additional fee for it). You ca see lots of river animals plus a red and giant panda. The sunk forest is actually the largest sweet water aquarium we have ever seen – really impressive!

We did not start with River Wonder entrance but instead went by the Flooded Forest way and made our way to Amazon River Quest which we did once we arrived. Good thing was, there were no queues for the River Quest, however was surprised that we have to pay for the 10 mins ride (SGD$5 Adults, SGD$3 Child).

The most thrilling part for me personally was when the boat had to be ""lifted"" to start the ride. For a 10 mins ride and with the limited number of sightings, I am not sure if it's worth to pay. Comparing to the rides in the Zoo, Bird Park, Night Safari - even though we have to pay extra for those rides, the duration was longer and we have the option of hopping on and off the trams. For the boat ride, the sightings were limited as what is there, is there or isn't. The habitat was man-made and looks quite small for these supposed 'free-ranging' animals.

When the boat 'quest' ends, the staff said we can get a stamp on our hand for a re-ride which we did because we did not see anything much in that first ride, which was about 12.30 pm...perhaps nap time for the animals. We took the ride again at about 3 pm where waiting time states 25 mins but we waited for only about 15 mins. If the queue had been longer, I am not sure if I'd wait again to experience the limited number of sightings.

For the River Cruise, great that it was free and quite scenic. No expectations for that ride for me but I thought it'd be great if it was a live commentary.

We were around the Yangtze River exhibit when my 6-year old needed the toilet. Without a map, I thought of just finding a toilet around the Rivers of the World exhibits. So we passed by Mekong River, the touch pool, Mary River, Ganges River, River Nile and we still could not find a toilet!! We passed by Congo River and I realized we were already back at the entrance where we have no choice but to exit and go to the toilet outside the entrance. After looking at the map, I was really surprised that there really were no toilets at the River of the World exhibits! And it is quite a looooong walk!

I read in the FAQs about the food options in River Safari. As I require halal food, I read that ""All food ingredients for all F&B outlets in the River Safari come from halal sources. However, most outlets are not certified halal because alcohol is served."" But I checked out River Safari Tea House and they served 'Char Siew Platter' and 'Teochew Bak Kut Teh' - which I am very sure they are pork, which is non-halal. So for those who need halal food, do visit the other dining places outside the Singapore Zoo instead (KFC Restaurant and Ah Meng Kitchen).",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:52:37.594251

There are large dinosaur animatronics on display at both the zoo and RS plus info boards comparing some of their animals to their prehistoric relatives. If you go on weekends, you can participate in their activities.

1) Trail : Complete a trail to earn a badge

2) Live and preserved animal specimens displayed near the entrance, alongside a fossil finding activity.

3) Craft activities near the boat plaza, my kids made a snapping turtle keychain, a scratch art bookmark and a little finger puppet...very nice and good quality crafts.

(2) and (3) are only available on weekends till 18 Dec, and till 4pm. I assume the trail can be done on any day throughout the week.

The trail makes the walk through the park a bit more purposeful and informative. A must-do for dinosaur fans. The animatronics are quite realistic and scared many kids, and impressed many adults based on the ooh and ahhs.

We also opted to participate in the 'Meet the American Beavers' special experience. You have to purchase additional tickets for this, and they bring you to the beavers' enclosure which is near the boat plaza. Kevin, our guide is very passionate about his job and interacted so easily with Justin and Selena (the beavers, not the singers). He shared with us a lot of interesting information about the animals and patiently answered my children's non-stop questions. We also got to feed and stroke them (their fur is so sooofftttt). Undoubtedly, this is a bit of a money-making venture for them but it was a good experience for us.

The river cruise is now included in the admission. It's just a slow ride on the Seletar Reservoir. When the cruise first started it used to include a zookeeper segment where they showed us specimens but now it's just a boat ride. You may be able to catch a glimpse of some of the animals at the Zoo and some native wild birds.

The Amazon River Quest is a more worthy ride although catching the animals is a real hit or miss. But if you're lucky, you can catch the giant anteater (only at RS) and the very beautiful leopard in a stunning enclosure.

We took a taxi to the river safari and got dropped off at the zoo entrance. The river safari entrance is a stone's throw from there, so quite convenient. We followed the park map in an anti clockwise fashion. Spending 10-15 min at most sections would be more than sufficient. The conceptualization is very good, although sometimes you feel very less space has been devoted to the animals. There a couple of viewing decks along the path to help you get a better view of the lake. If you're not taking the safari (we couldn't because we were with an infant), then you'd need to cross the lake using a bridge to view the other half of the park.
There are a couple of eateries and restaurants inside the park and they've provided benches at quite a few places for resting (considering you've to walk a lot). The whole park is stroller friendly with numerous diaper changing rooms. However, there's not much scope to let your infant down for crawling anywhere.
Overall, spending 2-3 hours here would be more than sufficient I'd say. One could go there around 2-3PM and then continue on to night safari which is what we did.",11-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:52:46.181530

We had bought our tickets online so were able to enjoy the 25% residents discount, which was nice, as we found the admission price slightly steep for a relatively small place (as compared to the zoo for eg). However, after our visit and seeing how everything was well set up for both visitors and the animals, I have to say the price is well worth it.

The route to take to visit the place is well marked out, so visitors won't have to waste time trying to figure out where to go. Most of the visitor routes were well sheltered so it was quite comfortable walking though the various areas. There was a nice mix of animals, all in their natural habitats.

The highlight would have to be Kai Kai and Jia Jia, our adorable pandas. I've only ever seen pandas one other time, at Ocean Park in HK, and was expecting to see lazy, lacklustre pandas and being rushed through the viewing area. Instead, we were allowed to stay for as long as we wanted and were charmed by the energetic Kai Kai who moved around his enclosure munching on bamboo leaves before moving on to search for other snacks. Jia Jia was less mobile, but looked adorable, snuggled against a tree to enjoy her feast of bamboo leaves.

After that, we followed the recommendation of other reviewers and skipped the cruise, opting instead for the Amazon River Quest. We sure didn't regret the extra $5 each that we had to pay. It allowed us to see the animals really up close. The only disappointment was that some of the animals were hiding when we went by. But at the end of our ride, we were asked if we wanted a re-ride! Of course, we said yes!! And on the second round, we got to see some of the animals we had missed earlier.

The aquarium area was also excellent. As you walk around the area, you can see the sea animals at different levels. Personal favourites were the playful otters and gentle manatees! To end off, there is a squirrel monkey forest where one can be immersed in their natural habitat and see numerous monkeys right in front of you with no barriers.

We also picked up a few nice and not overpriced souvenirs at the souvenir shop! Some things to note: as beverages and food are quite pricey inside, it is advisable to bring along your own snacks if you get peckish along the way. Additionally, if you want to be able to take your time and get great photo opportunities without the chaos of a crowd, do go early in the morning (when it opens at 10) and on a weekday, to avoid the peak periods. However, all in all, the River Safari was a great way to spend our morning. As a Singaporean, I have to say that I'm proud that we have created another world class wildlife reserve.

Odd that I was able to buy tickets for it when it was unavailable. I had to get a refund of $8 from the shops or F and B outlets.
The park is well arranged and we enjoyed it! I was able to teach my young companion about different rivers in the world and she enjoyed seeing the unusual fish and other reptiles. Of course seeing the great panda's is a highlight! Then we took the other boat ride and could see the giraffes and zebras in the zoo as the parks are situated next to each other. The monkeys were interesting and the huge freshwater aquarium was impressive! We 'met' the iguana lizard and the keeper was good enough to take pictures for us. That meant that we didn't need to buy any other photo's from the park. We loved the giant river otters! They were so active! Probably the weakest link are the F and B outlets!

Coming originally from India, was really sad about what is happening g to the the Ganges that feeds nearly half a billion people in North India. Literally poisoning with Industrial pollutants and human remains going unfiltered into India's most awesome river emanating from high up in the himalayas.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Travelove58,416655002,10-09-2016,5,Is it worth visiting River Safari- it really depends.....??.,"This is a very unique ""World Rivers/Forests concept"" attraction. It is different from any Zoos, Birdparks or Aquariums anywhere.

It showcases exotic & weird creatures/wildlife from 8 different prominent Rivers/Forests from all over the world, including the mighty Amazon.

Many of these Amazing Creatures seen here cannot be found in any aquariums. So there is UNDOUBTEDLY a huge difference between River Safari & S.E.A Aquarium!

Here you see at 'close up view' - a number of deep sea ""ancient creatures & weird looking monsters."" Including the Giant Pandas. One usually gets to see such exotic creatures only on TV documentaries, as they are found in deep rivers or forests.

The huge Amazon Piranhas are really awesome. Have seen piranhas in other aquariums but not this Huge! Piranhas has an awesome reputation & nothing beats seeing a whole school of Huge piranhas this close staring at you when you get close- just a few inches away separated by a thick glass.

How many people in their lifetime can or will the opportunity to go to the great Amazon River/Forests to see these amazing killers? Or even to the other rivers/forest?
EVEN if they do, its impossible to see piranhas in their natural habitat - THIS CLOSE!

So is it worth visiting River Safari?

1. YES:- if you want Quality "" ie the chance to see so many such weird & exotic creatures/monsters from all the major rivers/forests all in one place- & close up. All at a small price of less than S$30.

2.NO:- if you want ""Quantity"" becoz this place is not that big like the zoo. Less animals, less exhibits = lesser value for your ticket prices.

For us, its an experience definitely worth the small entrance fee.

Btw, the Amazon River Quest boat ride is not worth paying an extra $5. It's a 10 mins mild ride. Nothing much except for few animals & most are sleeping or not in sight. Skip this.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:53:14.329015

I would recommend buying tickets online (purely to save some money).

The aquarium was also excellent and there were so many dugongs and giant otters to see.

Halfway round there is a sizeable Panda enclosure with two pandas and the manatee tank is the final exhibit. The ticket includes a 15 minute boat ride which is kinda pointless as there isn't much to see. It goes past the rhino, giraffe and elephant enclosures at the zoo so you might see them if your lucky. During the boat trip they pass around a sample of giraffe poop and tail hair so that may sell it to you if your a fan of hair and poop! There is another boat ride which takes you through some more animal enclosures but there is a minimum height requirement and our one year old was too small so we didn't go. Unfortunately that meant I missed out on the giant anteaters.

I love those guys!

You get the impression the pandas are housed here solely to make the cost of admission worth it and justify the River Safari being separate from the zoo. I like aquariums but most of the tanks felt like filler between the pandas and manatees but they are worth the price of admission on their own. On the subject of tickets I would highly recommend you get the four park pass (zoo, river safari, night safari and bird sanctuary) which offers a considerable saving and is valid for a week from first use.

C,384874873,22-06-2016,4,Great for kids and the elderly!,"We booked a trip to the River Safari just a couple of days ago and had an enjoyable time there. The River Safari is the latest addition to the Wildlife Reserves of Singapore and features the fauna and flora of some of the most famous rivers in the world - Yangtze, Amazon, to name a few. It was a bright sunny day, suitable for an outing like this because the River Safari is mostly sheltered so you don't have to worry if it starts pouring in tropical Singapore. Furthermore, the walkways are gentle slopes and do not force you up on steep steps with ample walking space. There are plenty of sitting areas along the path as well so it makes for a great visit for those who may not be as mobile, or for the elderly who needs time and space to walk. Part of the trip also include a 15 mins boat road. Hop on the barge and the captain will bring you around the reservoir. For your info, the reserves sit by the edge of reservoir and hence offer you an interesting sight of one of Singapore's water catchment area. Also, you can get a couple of glances at some of the exhibits at the zoo as well. There's another boat ride called ""Amazon Quest"" but this requires you to purchase an additional ticket. I did not ride this though so I can't offer my comments to it but sister says that it offers you a chance to view more exhibits by a boat and its an enjoyable ride as well. Boat rides are determined by the weather so pray and hope for a sun shiny day when you go to visit!

Tips:
1. Go on a weekday if possible. It means lesser crowd, and lesser jostling of space to view the exhibits. It also means less people queuing for food, tickets, etc.
2. When taking the boat ride (not the Amazon Quest), try to take a seat on the left of the barge (this should be on the Captain's left) as it offers you the best view for the exhibit.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:53:58.153410

While S.E.A Aquarium comprised Sea Animals/Fishes, River Safari features Animals and Fishes from the Rivers of the World.
So it would be unfair to compare both Parks.

River Safari brought us to differnt parts of the World main Rivers, from the shallower Mississippi River to the Flooded Forest of the Manatees.

It was amazing to experience and explore the different atmospheres and animals, fishes in different habitats.
From small mammals like the mousedeer to huge Manatees, look out for Canola the manatee calf!

Giant Panda Exhibit is beautiful with the tourist favourite, Giant Panda Jia Jia Kai Kai, i felt that the red panda was the highlight of my tour, it is so fluffy and cute with the cute ears and face!
Golden Pheasant Exhibit was a little off the scale but the Pandas really brings up the experience.

The River Safari Cruise was not really an experience but being FOC, i felt that it was a great in a way where we can relax and recharge our energy while taking a scenic tour around Upper Seletar Reservoir
after half of the park conquered.

The Amazon River Quest was great, with exhibits at both sides comprising of mainly different species of primates, birds, jaguars etc, just a tab too fast IMO.

It would be good to read those little infomation boards along the way to understand the different characteristics of the rivers and animals and it would really be worth the 2- 3 hours visit.

Must Go :
- Squirrel Monkey Exhibit (Closed at 530pm)
- Giant Pandas Exhibit
- Manatee Exhibit
- Amazon River Quest (Not included in Ticket, $5)

Tips :
- Look out for the feeding timing where there are live presentators describing and demostrating the animals/fishes behaviours.
- River Safari is 90% covered with shelter so in case of rainy days, you can hang around the cafe for the rain to subside before going ahead with the rides when they resume.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:53:58.508474

We were not able to see anything else in the ride and to compensate, they circulated some specimens of giraffe like the hair and poo. Overall, underwhelming.

The Amazon River ride is a faster paced ride that brings you towards a narrow man-made boat course with animal shelters on both sides. Better than River Safari Cruise but not that impressive too.

Take note that you have to walk a very long distance to get to the boat ride. Factor that into your travel.

The highlight of this attraction is just seeing the pandas. I would rather recommend Singapore Zoo and SEA Aquarium for seeing terrestrial and aquatic animals.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:53:58.868569

It is much smaller than I expected (took < 2 hours to go round the whole park)but is well organized. It has covered walkways for 90% of the area, so bad weather is not really a problem, except that the river safari and river quest cruises are suspended. It is very clean too!

The animals are organized by the 6 rivers/ their habitats - Mississippi, Ganges, Yangtze, Amazon, Nile & Mekong. The cute panda, raccoon, lively squirrel monkey, salamander, colourful fishes, giant catfish, the big manatees which swim elegantly in the water (keep a look out for the calf too), the playful otter keep my daughters excited running from 1 aquarium/ enclosure to another...

In addition to learning about the animals, there is a lot of information about the rivers too. The longest river, the deepest, the biggest, mother of all rivers and so on.... We walked the park a second time as my girls want to find the answers to the quiz I set for them.... as I promise a gift each if they can get the right answers... : - )

The Chinese restaurant at the entrance is quite good too.

Some advices
- if you find a site too crowded, just move on to the next and come back later.... it Is a small park.
- go for the cruises first if the weather is not looking good
- take some time to enjoy the views too....",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:53:59.260798

The only thing this place really has to offer are the pandas, squirrel monkeys and some decent water exhibits. We bought a package to see all the zoos in Singapore because they all have a good reputation. First off, avoid buying this package unless you want your trip to consist of zoo animals. The river safari is by far the worst of the Singapore Zoo parks (night safari, main zoo and even the bird park is better value). The river safari cruise is a short boat ride where you are lucky to see any animal. The exhibits are nice but you are not seeing anything worth the money you pay. The only unique things about this zoo is that it is river themed and has squirrel monkeys and pandas. So you are really only paying to see these things (the rest you can catch at the other zoos for a better deal). IMPORTANT to note that this zoo closes at 7pm BUT the exhibits for the pandas and the squirrel monkeys close earlier! It does NOT make sense...we went late to this zoo (as we had stopped by the main zoo first) and did not even get to see the pandas or the squirrel monkeys because they closed early! Not sure why you have an entire zoo open until 7pm only to close most of the exhibits by 5:30pm. The whole zoo should close at 5:30pm because once the pandas and squirrel monkeys are closed then there is not much you can see here you cannot see at the main zoo.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:54:00.308489

Not value for money, though.","We arrived about 11am, on a Friday that's within the school holiday period, and was surprised that the place was not crowded; didn't even have to queue up to enter the park.

The park was well designed: there's only one path through all the exhibits and it's mostly sheltered, this makes it easy for visitors. We took a leisurely walk and enjoyed looking at the exhibits.

The place felt like an aquarium, though, with most of the exhibits comprising of fishes. Some of the larger exhibits/tanks were really impressive. While there were adequate explanations for all the exhibits, we felt that there could have been more interactive displays to engage visitors; the only thing we did the whole time was to ""look"" at things.

The free boat ride (rather, the cost is already included in your ticket) on Seletar Reservoir was relaxing, though it was rather disappointing that there were no live commentaries (only a recorded one). There was a lady staff on board that was supposed to act as a sort of guide, but she didn't do much apart from handing out some sample animal hair for visitors to see.

The Amazon River Quest ride, which is a bit like an amusement park roller coaster water ride though much more gentle, costs S$5 per adult and S$3 per child. The ride brought us through various animal exhibits, but we passed by the exhibits so fast that we didn't manage to get a good look at most of the animals. It would have been better if they provide a way for visitors to walk through those same exhibits after the ride and have a closer look at the animals.

Food choice is somehow lacking in the park (perhaps due to the small size of the park): apart from the snack kiosk selling drinks and ice cream and chips, the only cafe within the park sells Chinese food (the other restaurant just outside the entrance sells Chinese food too!) And the price was extremely expensive too, with a bowl of noodles and desert and drinks costing S$18!

The park was surprisingly small, and we were done in less than three hours (walking at a leisure pace), and that's including time spent in the cafe ordering food and then having lunch, and time spent waiting for the boat rides.

Overall, we felt that the River Safari is worth at least one visit. Though the ticket price could have been less to make the visit more value for money.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:54:06.819480

Our family of 3 adults and 4 children reached at 10am and entry was a Breeze with no queue. There were different sea animals and fish from different countries. Some are huge and unique. It was an eye opener for first timer like me. There are some animals like monkeys and pandas as we walk along the trails. Before the enclosure to see the monkeys there is a kiosk selling ice cream. My suggestion is the kiosk should station after this stop because no eating is allowed inside. Those who bought the ice cream were asked to finish before entering the enclosure. By the way the entry and exit is the same. We can stop to rest and have a drink or buy some snacks at a restaurant before the boat ride. The free boat ride is about 15 mins round the Seletar reservoir. There is another ride which is included in the ticket price is a little more exciting. It's situated opposite the boat ride entrance. Tickets are priced at $5 and $3 for adult and child respectively. You can still get the tickets if you did not buy together with your admission tickets. There's height limit though so advisable to buy the tickets on the spot but may have to queue if there's a crowd. We had lunch at KFC before we left at 2pm.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/LekhaSM,377853428,30-05-2016,4,Lovely experience,"One of the things we enjoyed in Singapore was the River Safari.
It was originally meant to have a River cruise, the Amazon River Quest meandering along the perimeter of the River safari and it would have been wonderful in that climate, but the rains put a stop to it as the cruise was suspended the day to avert any calamities. The River safari is built along the river theme along major rivers of the world – The Congo, the Nile, the Mekong, Ganges, Mississippi, Mary and Yangtze. The sea animals that inhabit these rivers form a part of the exhibits in each of these zones.

The Congo River exhibit named after the deepest river Congo contains colourful fishes like Congo tetras, cichlids, puffer fish, the salamander, and few other fishes.
The Nile, the longest river has the African arowana, the tigerfish, and the catfish, while Mississipi (The largest river system in North America, that flows through 10 states and is the world’s fourth longest river) contains the alligator gar, the paddlefish and the snapping turtle.
The Ganges zone has 2 large gharials that are so huge and stationery that they look like stone statues. The Mekong river has the giant catfish, sting rays and the macaque and you can then walk into a massive underwater aquarium in the Flooded Forest zone with huge fishes swimming around you. There are seating arrangements for you to rest and just gaze at those large and predatory fishes swim around and it is peaceful to watch them a long time. Some of these are 3m long and weigh 300 kg. You can watch around 4-5 sea otters diving into the water and then onto the log like rafts to relax a while and then hop on to the land, run around there and then dive back in. They rarely stay still and spend all their time repeating this activity. There are magnificent manatees that swim around gracefully, doing twirls and spins in the water that you can watch for a while.
Once you have had your fill of the underwater experience, you can walk into the Giant Panda forest which houses the red panda and 2 cute giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia in their own separate open areas. They are a darling of the crowds as they look fluffy and adorable, while all they do is plonk themselves and munch on bamboo shoots ignoring the adoring audience.
All this is close to an hour of walking and so the next stop is an eatery, Mama Panda Kitchen, where we can enjoy some coffee under the clouds and some cute panda cakes.
We then cross over a bridge across the river that looks green and serene, into the squirrel monkey forest, watch a huge anaconda, and stroll through a tropical aviary.",11-2015,Family,2020-01-30 03:54:07.531790

The entire park seems to be build around the Panda and Manatee exhibits, which were wonderful. But they are the only outstanding ones in the park. All others were arranged with large spaces in-between with information posters. Most exhibits were in such a way that small children could not see the animals.

The River-cruise in the park was a joke to be frank. We had to split up because they did not allow small children inside. It was too slow to be fun and too fast to see the animals that were placed next to the ""wild"" river.

It's just not as engaging or interesting. There's the giant pandas but I've never really understood what the fuss about them is.

What's nice with younger children is that the route around is quite contained so if you have a few children to handle its a bit less stressful trying not to lose them than the zoo might be. However young ones will likely be too short to be allowed on the boat ride, one of the key features of the river safari concept so it can feel like missing out in that regard.

It's pricey but well worth the money. It's out of the way but then again, so are the zoo and night safari, and there are several transport options anyway.

The park is wonderfully laid out in a circuit and each area is regionally themed. The park (including the bathrooms) were clean and tidy. Seating tended to be clumped in areas near vendors. Food and drink vendors are reasonably priced. Gift shops aren't very ""in your face"", thankfully. I think the park is suitable for those with limited mobility, and those carrying prams.

The exhibits were generally well-lit, with the exception of some of the indoor aquatics. Many exhibits are fairly open (meaning no glass between you and the animals). Highlights for me: otters, giant pandas, red panda, squirrel monkeys, manatees. The seasonal decorations for Chinese New Year were excellent as well.

If you are wondering if it is worth extra for the boat rides (River Safari Cruise and Amazon Boat Ride) then yes, it absolutely is. Seeing the elephants and jaguar from afar is amazing.

The park has a lighthearted stance towards educating people about the animals in the area, the amount of information is enough to hold your attention and is written for all ages. I'm glad the park frequently mentions conservation and the effect of human interaction on nature HOWEVER it doesn't tell people how they can help or prevent further degradation in ways that they can manage e.g. not littering, not dumping waste in waterways.

This is more an educational park. Dedicated to create thinking about the care of water supplies, fauna and vegetation.
We were in a family visit with our preadolescent son and he really appreciated the visit. We were moved about the facts regarding human kind disrespect and neglect of the environment.

We went early and taking other Tripadvisor's advice we headed straight for the Panda's. They did not disappoint! One was eating and very sleepy but the other was so active, running about and rolling, climbing and generally making a real show of it! We have been to Chengdu and this was up there with that experience. We then made our way down to the river boat and log ride. We had tickets to both and chose the log ride first. It isn't very long but it was fun and we sat at the front and got a bit wet at the start (great on a hot day!). Some of the exhibits we didn't see as they must have been hiding which you can't get upset about as they aren't exactly caged. It was a bit upsetting to see the jaguar pacing but otherwise the monkeys and birds all looked happy enough. The boat cruise was uneventful but pleasant. We saw two giraffe and one elephant and some cranes from afar. Not bad but not exactly what we thought we'd see! There were no crowds at this time as we were early. We then walked through the rest of the exhibits and managed to catch the end of a feed for some monkeys. They sat right near us and ate, one jumped down right next to me and then walked down the footpath. Amazing. The other exhibits were very educational and had an environmental theme throughout.

Surprisingly comfortable and not too sweltering in todays humidity with many fans and a/c areas around the park. Some portions of the park is also shaded and some has cooling areas :) Nice setup unfortunately the displays should have more matured fishes, ie. a small wallago and goonch when it could be a monster fish? Nice planted setup with many schooling fishes too, beautiful colors but most (70-80%) of fishes can be found in petshops around Singapore and Malaysia. With their setups was expecting to see more matured tanks ie. a full cichlid community from tanganyika. Or being able to see a fully grown Bagarius!

It's also the most disappointing. With the word ""Safari"", you're expecting at least a Night Safari-style Tram Ride or enclosures that make you feel you're within the wildlife environment like the Singapore Zoo's. Instead, you'll walk through a covered path surrounded with aquariums featuring river fishes from different parts of the world. Of course, we are basing our expectations on the spectacular precedent set by the Singapore Zoo and their brochures, so we were looking forward to seeing river-dwelling animals (not just fishes) in a simulated natural environment - not just rows of aquariums which are disappointing especially if you're visiting River Safari after the SEA Aquarium in Sentosa. We did see animals in their simulated natural environment, only after paying an extra 5 SGD each in the Amazon River Quest attraction. The attraction can be considered the highlight of the park but given the general ho-hum level of the park, this should be included in the admission ticket. You can skip the River Cruise along the reservoir unless you really want to see the back of the Singapore Zoo.

To be fair, there are several impressively huge aquarium displays featuring the giant Mekong catfish and Mekong carp, the Amazon Flooded Forest and the out-of-place airconditioned Giant Panda enclosure. The Giant Pandas named Kai Kai and Jia Jia are well worth the admission but you have to wonder why they are inside the River Safari when their natural habitat are far from a major river.

There are restaurants inside like the River Safari Tea House and the Mama Panda Kitchen that serves a panda patterned red bean bun.

For great value, buy your tickets online and avail of their Park Hopper offer if you want to visit Singapore's other wildlife parks. Not only you'll get discounts (20% for Singapore-issued credit cards / 10% for Visa / Mastercard from outside Singapore), you'll also get freebies like a free tram ride in Singapore Zoo (worth 5 SGD) and the River Cruise ride in River Safari. That way, even if you're disappointed with the River Cruise, you won't waste money, just 15 minutes of your time.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:54:35.740267

This isn't how it is though. River safari consists of 3 parts:

1. A walk that is named and divided by areas: Mekong River, Ganges River, Nile River. Sea creatures from these rivers are kept in aquariums accordingly. My favourite was the alligator in Ganges River! I will attach a pic of my sister standing with the alligator below. Also, along this walk, you will be going through Panda Forest. One red panda, 2 giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They were lovely! I was fascinated by the Red Panda so much! We only managed to see one giant panda as the other was sleeping

2. River Cruise. Be reminded that you need to purchase an extra ticket at SGD5 per adult for this trip. It is a 15 minute boat ride on the river, and if you are lucky, you may get to see giraffes and elephants from Singapore Zoo in this ride. We only managed to see giraffes.

3. Amazon Ride. This will cost another additional SGD5 per adult. Young children are not allowed on this ride. You are made to sit in a boat like thing that goes on a water track, very much like water rides in a theme park. You get to see different kind of animals along this ride, and again if you are lucky, you can spot jaguars on this ride. This ride is about 15 minutes as well.

We've been to the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park, etc but this experience was exceptionally worth taking time to explore as it provides visitors a different unique experience indoors and out.

Though it may be cold indoors (perhaps because it rained briefly) particularly for the comfort of the beautiful creatures, bringing along a shawl or sweater serves the purpose to comfort those who are afraid of a little chill (like myself) otherwise normal tees, shorts and sneakers would be comfortable.

I initially thought it was a strange request when my son suggested this venue to spend our day together with grandma as there's probably not much to be entertained with. We thought it would probably be a few short minutes but ended up spending more than two hours walking and enjoying each experience together. The visit could probably take another hour if we wanted to explore more but we had to adjourn to our other plan as we didn't expect our stay there to be long (great opportunity to return for another visit with new visitors!).

It was a three-generation family activity; grandma (active and loves adventure), two young adult children together with my husband and I. It was a great outing because everyone was mesmerized by the beauty of these creatures and how ""unreal"" they look, etc.

The only disappointing thing is the Amazon boat ride. Its quite fast to take photo's and most of the animal's are hidden. Obviously it's normal but seeing that you must pay extra for this it was disappointing.

I can see why the zoo lent the pandas to the river safari as without them it would not be worth it.

One main feature was a boat ride. There are two - one a boat cruise around the river and another theme park ride around some larger animal enclosures. I found this ride disappointing as it felt so rushed. You cruise past animals like the leopards but only see them fleetingly for around 5 seconds. There is no opportunity to come back and see them - only visable from the boat and each trip costs money.

There is quite a get smaller exhibits (fish, birds, smaller annals) which are ok but the main features being the pandas, red pandas, manatees. The main thing we really enjoyed was the squirrel monkey enclosure getting up close to many.

Unless there is particular animals you want to see, I think it would be better to pay the extra money and go to the proper zoo next door. The night Safari is also much better.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-30 03:55:03.121774

I'm not sure if we were just super lucky, or they hold hourly feeding times for them, but when we arrived at the Panda enclosure, the Pandas were sitting out eating bamboo! The enclosure is so well built and looks so natural, and lush, the ginormous pandas are literally just metres away, and there is no glass or fencing between yourself and the animals, just clever enclosure design.
I think in all, my partner and I spent around an hour just gazing at the pandas, they are such beautiful creatures.
The whole park is laid out well, with ample signs explaining the exhibits. Plenty of sea creatures, I have a soft spot for stingray, to I enjoyed seeing them. There is opportunity to have your photo taken with a Capybara, which for us is another unforgettable experience that we enjoyed.

After a small walk through a few aquariums and futile attempts to catch a Panda, you get to realize just how much time and money to be wasted on this.

The River ""Cruise"" is the most ridiculous activity ever. They hype it up and it's basically a 12-13 min ride in the middle of a lake on a boat. People queue up unnecessarily for a wasteful activity like this. You can't spot even an ant.

Th Amazon ""River Quest"" I believe. These people are experts at duping people with attractive names. There it ends. The ride was cancelled due to technical issues and they didn't even refund the money.

I liked that they laid out the enclosures/exhibit based on regions of the world..i.e Amazon, African etc

I thoroughly loved the show they put up, very entertaining.

All the animals were healthy and quite active. And of course, how can I forget mentioning the two cute giant Pandas. A must see since these animals are so rare.

The opportunity to learn more about these amazingly gentle mammals and their environs is not too be missed. The Keepers are extremely knowledgeable and went out of their way to ensure we had a great experience. Nabilah, Sean and others (sorry cannot recall all the names) were wonderful and I cannot recommend it enough.

The tour provides you with an opportunity to enter the safari before the crowds. We were taken to the Manatee enclosure and learnt not just about the manatees, but the giant otters too. We were fortunate enough to be there when they were feeding the otters too - I never knew they where so big!

You don some waterproof overalls and boots ( ladies I would recommend wearing shorts as easier to navigate than a dress - not impossible in a dress just a little tricker) and are provided with a locker to store all your gods. We removed all our jewellery and put bags etc in the lockers.

We learnt about how they are fed, the different ways they engage with the manatees. You then get the opportunity to feed them yourselves which is incredible. Like kids, they have to eat their vegetables before their treats.

It was highly educational, personal experience and I would really recommend that you take the chance to interact safely with these mammals. The Keepers are superb and their interest and understanding of the animals in their charge is fab.",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 03:56:15.458661

No, most of this park is done on foot. The River part refers to the fact that the park is trying to give you an idea of what wildlife lives in the various great rivers of the world. There do this with large aquariums. You walk around in the open but under cover (ok for a rainy day). The rivers include the Amazon, the Ganges, the Nile, the Mekong and others. There are a variety of fish to see, unless of course you think a fish is a fish is a fish.
There is a part of the admission fee that entitles you to a 15 min 'cruise' on the reservoir. Also for a small extra fee you can do the Amazon river quest whereby you travel on a lazy river/log flume style ride. (The only drop is at the beginning to set you off). On this quest you may see a Jaguar, monkeys,Flamingos plus other animals.

As well as this there are the two Giant Pandas. A hit for everyone, however I think the enclosures looked too small. Indeed one of the pandas was pacing up and down in the way I have seen on TV programmes of distressed bears.

The park is small and the Amazon Quest is a bit of a cheat. Without the joint ticket you have to pay for it additionally. My best advice is don't. It has a long queue, and moves too quickly to actually see any animals. Some main attractions are here such as the jaguar, but there isn't enough time to stay and spot it as the boat is whisking you away before you know it.

The Zoo itself is quite good if you like zoos and accept there is value in the educational role these places represent. As for the River Cruise and Safari ride these to me are not much more than tepid theme park tours.
The Amazon River Safari left you wondering what did you pay. If it is seeing animals that was certainly not what we got. Firstly the ‘boats’ tend to travel too fast to see anything much assuming there is much to see anyway. Personally not worth spending the extra.
The river cruise is no different. Basically you do a 10 minute circuit around what is basically the city’s water supply reservoir which the zoo abuts. Seriously, save your money and give this a miss.

The River Safari is probably smallest of all wildlife parks in Singapore so you don't have to walk as much to cover everything. While this means there's fewer animals on display, they also have a good variety of fishes. At one particular place, you're also allowed to touch a starfish and a crab if you like. Also, being contructed in an enclosed space, there's very good air conditioning unlike other parks where humidity can become a huge concern after a while.

While there are quite a few good things going on, there were some disappointments too. If I knew what's on display on the boat ride, I'd have no problem giving it a miss. At the end of the ride, it felt like we wasted 15 mins of our time. There weren't any exotic or rare to see animals. The Amazon River Quest, although good was a bit too short. So much that we spent about an hour in queue for our chance on the ride which finished in about 10 minutes. Not to mention the frequent technical issues with ride causing indefinite delays. The management will most definitely have to rethink the idea of the River Safari.

A tip for first time travelers. Pick up the park guide pamphlet at the entrance. That's all the guidance you'll need while at the River Safari.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:56:57.826294

It was an excellent opportunity. Most visitors delayed their arrival and those who were there stayed at the front of the park while the rain bucketed down. We headed straight for the enclosed panda area via the covered walkways. You still need a raincoat/umbrella to keep dry with heavy rain but the walkways were mostly sheltered. We had exclusive viewing of the pandas for about 10 minutes before anyone else made their way to the area. It was HEAVEN! The enclosure for the pandas is fabulous. We stayed for about 40 minutes and left when the crowds started getting more than we could bare. I highly recommend skipping the boat ride. It's a great marvel of machinery at the beginning with the elevator lift but you don't see anything on the trip. The boat move WAY TOO FAST. We also enjoyed the funny looking monkeys with the beards and the ones in the open enclosure that you can walk around with the monkeys. Watching the feeding of the manatees was also great fun and I could spend hours watching the otters. They play with their reflections in the glass. It's priceless. Let's face it though, people come for the Pandas and they are world class.

For added discounts, combine a ticket here along with a multi-attraction ticket (you dont have to visit all on the same day and certainly might not be able to if you are doing the Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari given the amount of time you'll need for all 3). Allow yourself 2 to 3 hours to explore the whole River Safari. Unlike the Night Safari, the main part of this attraction is walking around river themed areas (Amazon, Nile, India etc) with various aquatic creatures to see. There's a small area where you can touch a starfish and horseshoe crab and you may need to wait about 10 minutes for your turn if its busy. One of the main animal encounters will the Giant Panda (there are 2 pandas here, a male and female) so if you've never seen a panda before, then the River Safari is a must. After the first half of the tour, you can hop on to a boat (there may be a 15 minute wait time here depending on crowds) but you'll enjoy a 20 minute, relaxing boat ride across the reservoir and may spot rhinos and giraffe grazing through the trees across the river. This is included in your ticket. There's a second boat ride, the Amazon Adventure which is at a 5 SGD supplement to your park entry (personally I think this really should be included in the park entry). Its worth it if you have small children as they'll love the 10 minute journey seeing monkeys, birds, the jaguars and leopards among other animals. It can be missed however. Try to get here early in the day or later in the afternoon to avoid the crowds (but note that the last boat tour departs at 6pm). Compared to the Night Safari and Singapore Zoo, the River Safari is slightly less of a must-do - but that's my personal opinion. If you love water and sea creatures then this isnt to be missed.",06-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:57:06.721518

Youre at the counter to buy tickets but dont know if you should go ahead with the your plan. Well this scenario is typical of many in tropical Singapore where it rains 1/4 of the year. Dont fret much cos the singapore river safari is here to the rescue. Mostly dont under the comfort of a sheltered walkway or indoors, this small but eventful park has a few surprises along the way. Able to finish everything within 2-3 hours, i would recommend any who wants to wait out the rain before exploring singapore zoo. Its designed in such a way that you just follow the flow, exploring the park clockwise; youll know what i mean when you get there.
Tips:
-Reservoir cruise is complimentary and sitting on the left side gives you a better view,
-Amazon river quest costs $5 but its super recommended,
-Spend a little more time at the giant panda enclosure to get that perfect shot,

The “River Safari” is great. We thought it was very well laid out, and that the animals on display were a good mix of the “normal” and the more unusual (including several species, we've never seen before in a zoo). Leaving aside the pandas the manatees were the major attraction (absolutely mesmerising to be honest).

Now the pandas, they have a purpose build air conditioned enclosure. We've seen pandas in around half a dozen zoos throughout the world, and this is by far the best facilities of any. Maybe we were lucky, maybe we were willing to wait for 15 mins, but we saw both pandas extensively (primarily eating bamboo, but not just this).

We didn't do the boat trip, it seems somewhat superfluous, something that a number of other comments support.

I would add, that this isn't really a river safari, its a walk (of around 1km) through the various exhibits (many of which are in air conditioned enclosures – they feel the heat/humidity as well!)

If you only want a normal zoo, then the zoo ticket is probably for you, if you want something different (plus the pandas) this is the one to do.

Excellent, and not just because of the pandas",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:57:24.140680

Included in the entrance are walking trails where you see animals like primates and manatees (underwater and above) and a reservoir boat ride where we didn't see any animals at all. You pay extra for the Amazon River Ride but it's worth it as it's fun and there are lots of animals to see. We took the ride twice as they weren't very busy. Children have to be a minimum height for this ride. Because we arrived early we almost had the place to ourselves and were able to get on the Reservoir boat and Amazon River rides straight away without queuing.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Ruo Lin L,565618996,10-03-2018,4,Here for the pandas. Reservoir cruise was boring.,"As its name suggests, the River Safari is a river-themed zoo and aquarium, located between the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari. If rivers do not fascinate you, there are two pandas located in the River Safari (which was really the main highlight for me).

1. Themes

The River Safari's attractions are categorised by major rivers of the world. For example, there are zones named Mississippi River, Yangtze River, Mekong River etc.

You can see animals such as catfishes, alligator snapping turtles etc. in tanks, both small and large.

Leaving aside the Giant Panda Forest, one of the more impressionable zones was the Amazon Flooded Forest. Here, we got to see, amongst other animals, the manatees and giant river otters.

The manatees are large animals and it was quite a sight seeing them swim. As for the pair of otters, one moment they were sunbathing on the bank, the next moment they were diving into the water demonstrating their excellent swimming skills.

2. Pandas

Of course, the pandas deserve a separate mention. Do note that it can get pretty chilly in this section as the bio dome is kept at a cool 16 - 24 degrees to simulate the pandas' natural climate.

The first animal that you see upon entering the Giant Panda Forest is not the famous pandas, but the red panda. At first sight, the red panda looks nothing like the lazy black and white pandas. This particular red panda was very active and hopping from one branch to the other.

Although we did not manage to see the famous pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia the first time we walked past their enclosures, we waited for a while before walking back because there was no way I was going to miss seeing the pandas at the River Safari.

It was exciting seeing the pandas in real life.

3. Reservoir Cruise

There is a Reservoir Cruise which you can board for free. They suspended the cruise when it was raining and resumed it when the rain stopped.

This was a cruise along the upper Seletar Reservoir and honestly, boring. We got to see a giraffe and rhinoceros at the ride. The guide also passed around some giraffe poo which attracted some curious looks from tourists. I would rather they skip passing the giraffe poo around because most people were either not interested or did not know what it was.

It was a nice, slow boat ride, where we got to enjoy some breeze. Other than that, there's nothing much to the reservoir cruise.

4. Amazon River Quest

There was also a Amazon River Quest right next to the Reservoir Cruise. It costs S$5 per adult and S$3 per child. You can purchase your tickets at the Boat Plaza. The signboard states that you should be prepared to be wet.

It was a good thing we were there on a weekday because there was totally no queue. There were a few mini roller-coasteresque drops but nothing too frightening. We sat in the middle and did not get wet but do not know whether those sitting at the front or back would get wet- if this is a concern, you should speak to the guides before purchasing your tickets. This gave some thrill factor to the River Safari, although rather insignificant, as the ride was short.

If you do not take this boat ride, you would not be able to see some animals, such as the Caribbean flamingos, capybaras, black howler monkeys and jaguars etc. Some of the animals had gone into hiding so we did not see them.

5. Food

The price of food at Mama Panda Kitchen is pretty decent and reasonable. I tried the Chicken and Mushroom Bamboo Rice ($9.90) - nothing too gourmet, but decent. The Panda Chocolate Custard Bao (S$2.90) would also delight children.

6. Planning your trip

The walkways are covered so this can be a wet weather activity (except that you may not be able to sit the rides if there is bad weather).

That said, there are a number of activities which are scheduled at certain timings. If you want to catch those, I suggest that you download the map which states the timings of these activities.

There are hydration points around and you can save the earth and money by bringing your own water bottle.

As it may be slightly cold in the panda dome, do bring along a light jacket if you are not comfortable with a temperature of 16-24 degrees.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:57:25.204813

I wouldn't bother paying the extra for the boat trip as there isn't much point as you are on the lake maximum 15 mins and all you see are trees, there isn't much point to it and should be free.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:57:25.926917

You can go on a short cruise around the lake (and see almost no wildlife), but the main attraction is the walk past many underwater tanks, or aquariums, almost a mini ""SeaWorld"". Then on to see many animals in a zoo - like experience. As all the walkways are covered, it's an ideal trip in the rain. You could easily spend at least 2 hours here.

One of the highlights for us was seeing the two Giant Pandas.

If you are going on the Night Safari, this is an ideal tour to take beforehand.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 03:57:26.260736
,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/PeterLanky,562833183,26-02-2018,4,Better than I expected,"The river safari takes you on a walk around the park with themed areas based on the flora and fauna of a number of major world rivers. Most of the walk is under cover so you will not get too hot in the afternoon. Towards the end, you get a boat ride on the lake lasting 15 minutes with a commentary. There is also the Amazon River Quest, but this is an extra charge, which is why I have not given this attraction 5 stars.

To get the full experience, I would recommend spending about 3 hours there. If you have a 4 park pass, this combines well with the night safari as this opens soon after the river safari closes. It takes over an hour from the city by bus/MRT, but we found that going via Choa Chu Kang rather than Ang Mo Kio to be the easier route. Bus/MRT fare from the city is around S$2.

There are water dispensers all over the park, so you only need to take an empty bottle. Food is available inside the park and outside the entrance, both local and fast food, though take note that the outside ones close around 7pm if you are moving on to the night safari.

We travelled by MRT, but had to wait 40 minutes for our turn on the shuttle bus as there were so many people waiting the first bus was full and we had to wait for a second bus. On arrival at the park we made our way to the reservoir cruise, rushing past the exhibits as we had assumed the reservoir cruise was a highlight. We were wrong! A 15 minute ride in a boat where we could just about see the giraffes in the Zoo and very little else.

By this time we were hot and disappointed, so we sat down, had a cool drink and felt much better. We saw some monkeys which were free to roam in their walk-through enclosure, a very large snake which was in a pen, then we came to a huge glass-sided tank where three otters were fighting over a piece of fish. To watch these animals twist and turn through the water was mesmerising.

Another huge tang contained manatees, creatures which were mistaken for mermaids by sailors who must have been a long time at sea.

Back at the entrance we decided to make a second circuit at a more leisurely pace. The scenes of rivers from around the world contained a mixture of fish, reptiles, birds and animals which were interesting and attractive. The two Giant Pandas in their air conditioned suite are clearly the stars of the show and we were fortunate enough to be able see both animals clearly. We also saw a red panda close-up as it walked along a branch above our heads.

The River Safari itself is a bit of a joke. There is a reservoir boat trip which is a short (20 to 25 minute) cruise on the reservoir where you get occasional glimpses of animals at the neighbouring zoo. The Amazon River safari is something of a theme park water ride - but is far more interesting with many more animals to see.
The most spectacular displays are the huge aquariums ... not forgetting the pandas.If you need to make a choice of Zoo or River Safari then I would suggest that this option takes priority.

This as just a poor aquarium that has a 10 minute mini water ride and the Giant Panda enclosure. There is a River Safari boat that takes about 20 minutes but this only sails up and down the lake and not past any animals.
The layout however is quite good but you could easily do the park in 1 hour. The Amazon boat ride is a disappointment as this takes you quickley passed any animal enclosures at a speed with no time to savour any moments or even capture on the camera. The 3 drops are tame and do nothing to enhance the experience.
Young children will probably enjoy the whole experience but it is but poor for adults. The only redeeming features are the Manatee enclosure and the Panda's (when they are out).

Singapore cleverly has its Zoos all starting from the same place so you can take your pick of which you want to visit; make sure you have the River Safari at the top of your list. Most comment surrounds the presence of the Panda, however the Safari offers so many other animals, many of them unusual, to excite the visitor. There are myriads of different fish species and monkeys, sea-cows, playful otters, the anaconda, electric eels and much more. A river cruise takes you past the rhinoceros and giraffes residing in the Zoo next door; the Amazon River Trip displays the Anteater, Peccaries, colourful birds to name just a few. One of the highlights of the Safari was the way information was presented to the visitor, both describing the river being displayed and the life around it. It was clearly presented, colourful and brief enough to keep readers interested. Too often we saw parents drag their children passed the information displays instead of encouraging them to read and learn - for some a lost opportunity. The Safari precinct was well sign posted, there were plenty of rest places, cafes, toilets and easy exits if needed. The staff were always helpful and friendly.

- Informative exhibits and beautiful tanks to view the creatures.
- The manatee and giant otter enclosures were great, providing a good variety of perspectives to view the animals from.
- The Squirrel Monkey Forest was also really good, the monkeys are very active and lively. Observing these animals up close without a barrier makes a very different experience.

Some things we didn't:

- We went on a day in which the Amazon River Quest was closed for maintenance, which was a bad move in hindsight as that meant we missed out on a good quarter of the park.
- We were also disappointed to find that some of the animals listed on the park map weren't there.
- The park was also much smaller than expected, which did not justify the price.
- While we did manage to get a glimpse of one panda, the video feed that was supposed to show Jia Jia in her quarters looked to be pointing at a random corner in a lab.

The exhibits here on the whole feel much newer then the neighbouring zoo and are very well presented.

Not entirely sure why they feature in a 'River Safari' park, but the giant panda exhibit was perhaps the highlight. Not only for the pandas, but for the 20 degree climate controlled exhibit area!

Towards the end of the park the 'flooded Amazon' area was quite fascinating as it explains the difference between the wet and dry season in the Amazon rainforest.

While the panda exhibition was interesting and the Amazon boat ride added a somewhat theme park feel to the place, the place just didn't feel like a complete, coherent attraction that could stand on its own.

In the distance you may see a giraffe or two, a few rhino’s and a couple of elephants, (bring your zoom lens).

Most disappointing, was the fact that the elephants were chained by the legs in a small clearing so you could view them.

They were clearly distressed and trying to pull the chains to free themselves while the keepers were hiding nearby.

Having participated in many wildlife cruises throughout the world, I can honestly say that this is not a true river cruise, but more of a charade.

This pretence should be an embarrassment to the zoo and is a travesty, perhaps even cruelty, to the poor elephants involved.

By all means, viewing the aquariums and other parts of the zoo by foot is far more pleasing, but omit this artificial cruise.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 03:59:13.415323

It's a really long walk to get to a boat that literally takes you nowhere and you see absolutely nothing. I'm not kidding. The boat travels at a speedy 1km an hour and does a giant lazy turn in a river/lake? and you don't see a single animal or anything other than brown water and greenery. To get to the boat you must first trek a few kilometers past 1 million fish tanks so unless you're a fish enthusiast this is just added to the torture. The staff on the boat hand out giraffe poop to keep things exciting. No I'm not joking. ""We are on the River Safari, isn't this exciting.

The River Safari is right next door to the zoo, so good to do together. It is set out in a long rambling walk through exhibits - great so you are not missing anything or zig zagging around. You go through areas representing the major rivers of the world and their unique flora and fauna. Touch pool was good for starfish, sea cucumbers etc. But the absolute highlight was the seacow/manatee/dugong pool. It was huge, full of various fish, sting rays and the dugongs. There were various viewing points and you could spend ages just watching them all swim around. They actually like human interaction and will swim up to you at the glass and show off by swimming upside down etc.
We were really disappointed by the pandas. They are in separate enclosures - one was on a platform asleep with his back to everyone, but at least you could see him. No idea where the girl one was but certainly not visible in her habitat, we couldn't even see her on the screen showing her night den. So a bit disappointing but that's animals.
We were also amazed at how lame the boat ride on the reservoir was. Seriously we were herded onto a boat and did a large circle, crossing the back of the zoo where we could glimpse giraffe heads and maybe an elephant and then back to the wharf. It was just a waste of time, but included in the entry price.
Also included was a little theme park type ride - Amazon River Quest - which was cute and took you through areas with various animals on the banks and a tiny rapids at the end, just for a thrill for the kids.",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:59:22.966197

The attractions in the park were quite enjoyable, and we especially enjoyed the panda exhibit, touching the fish and the aquarium area, although we didn't see much on the river cruise. The Amazon cruise was like a theme park ride as opposed to the proper boat on the river cruise. It cost $5 extra each, and was really good, although the boat went much too fast, so it was sometimes hard to catch the animals and even harder to take photos before you disappeared around a corner. I'm not sure if it's busier during peak times (we visited quite close to ride closing at 6pm), but it felt very rushed considering the amount to see on the ride. It was still enjoyable, but we were left wishing it had been slower, especially at it cost an additional fee.

The park was relatively small, and with the exception of the squirrel monkey exhibit, which also closes as 6pm, we were able to comfortably get around everything between 4:30-6:30. Comparing to the Night Safari area, it's much smaller and flatter to walk around.

Most of tourists are coming here because of pandas Tia Tia and Kai Kai. Apart from pandas I would highly recommend to go for Amazon River Quest, which cost just additional 5 SGD. It's a 10 minutes boat ride in the Amazon rainforest. You will see Jaguars, tapirs, capybaras and other animals during your trip. My most favorite attraction is Amazon Flooded Forest - the worlds largest freshwater aquarium inhabited with 18 animal species, the biggest from all of them is manatee.

I'm slower than the average visitor, I like just watching the animals and also reading the info plaques. It has a fitting size (smaller than the zoo) and a great mix of animals and fish, which are different from the regular zoo animals. It's also well designed so most of the animals are visible in their habitats. We bought the 4-park hopper ticket which is valid for one entry per park for 7 days, but they also sell a 2-park ticket. I recommend prioritizing this and the night safari if you have visited a couple of other zoos before or if you only have half a day+an evening to spare in your itinerary. This is also the only park where you can see the great panda and the red panda. Inside you can take two boat rides: one is free and the other is 5$ per adult. If pressed for time you can skip the free ride (it's a nice ride and rest for your feet, but you only see rhinos, giraffes and maybe elephants from afar) and save 20-30min boat ride and waiting time. The other ride (Amazon River) is quite fun, you get really close to the animals and there a many to see (it's probably more fun to do with children or childish adults). We were lucky to see the jaguar on the ride, but it's not guaranteed. It only takes app. 15min. Notice that those animals can only be viewed from the boat rides and not by foot.

But I seriously spent more time at the River Safari, because It is sheltered and It offers something new as compared to the zoo.

There are the main exhibition as well as 2 rides right near the middle of the park. One of them is Free and really quite a waste of time unless you have never been on a river ride, without seeing animals. Because of the route and distance, it is almost impossible to see any animals. But its Free though. The other ride is a paid one with SGD5 topup. That is ok, a stolen concept from Theme Parks, and In fact exactly the same as the one at Universal Studio featuring dinosaurs (fake) instead of animals. But however, It is quite Fast and they tried to cramp too many animals into that one ride making It hard to see them all. Let alone catch on ALL (on camera, Pokemon Joke). But you are offered a second ride if you can just wait a little. However, the getting off and getting on kinda turned me off though. But still a pretty good ride. I would recommend doing this at least once.

Other than these, there are the lazy pandas which is just like any other pandas if you had seen them before. Just wondering why would the panda be placed in the River Safari instead of The Zoo. Maybe its a marketing and $$ thing. But since I have seen pandas so many times before, I can fairly say this is Not one of the best one.

Now, despite ALL the negative, once You get to the magestic Manetees right at The end, you will find it ALL worth while because of the great tank and The graceful giants. You can always spend more time here watching them swim and feed.

We started immediately with the Pandas visit as the time was the least crowded and can get a better view on the Pandas. There were two feeding sessions at 1130 and 2pm where u can see pandas eating in action.

The river safari is a semi indoor/outdoor aquarium that also houses some non aquatic animals. Towards the end there are two boat rides, the river cruise and the river quest.

The cruise is included in entry price and is just a mild boat ride around the lake. There's little to none wildlife to see and throughly underwhelming.

The river quest ride is slightly more interesting, the route is littered by wildlife on both sides include a leopard and flamingos. It is much more interesting than the cruise but too short in my opinion.

The River Safari is well designed, with a set path so you can see everything and then plonk out at the finish line. The highlight, as everyone else has mentioned, is the panda exhibit. They have normal and red pandas there and they are ridiculously adorable.

Really enjoyed the visit and thought it was good value for money.
The way the animals are kept is exemplary.
Enclosures for just about all animals are clean and the animals look like they are enjoying the wildlife.
The Pandas are also well kept. The enclosure may not be very big, but there seems to be adequate space for the water/pond area, plenty of bamboo, controlled temperature/humidity, resting area.
At the time that I went, I believe the female Panda had undergone some kind of insemination in view of captive breeding. So she was not in the public's sight, but of course it was for the greater good.
The red Panda was also really cute and you'd be surprise at how close you get to it in the enclosure.
Just wish people (the loud tourists) would remain a bit quiet in the Panda enclosure and make less of noise so as not to disturb them.
River Safari is well maintained and value for money. Wouldn't mind going back next time.

Tips:
You may have fast food near the food court outside the various zoos they have in the area.
Getting a taxi there may cost you a bit of money given that it's quite far from the city centre area.
One of the budget-friendly ways to get there is by MRT and with a subsequent bus service leading to the zoo.
You may as well use the bus and then the MRT to make it back to your hotel afterwards.
The way to get there by MRT and subsequent bus service is well explained on the River Safari's website.
Had food at KFC after the visit. Was well within budget in that sense too.
Tickets purchased online come with a slight discount.
It was raining during our visit but that didn't stop us from carrying on with everything we had to do. The place is well sheltered just about everywhere. (Had ponchos but didn't need to use them)

Normally map is a must when visit places like zoo, because there are too many walking trails. But we do not need one here because the walkway can lead us visit the whole safari without missing anything. We took both the river cruise (complementary) and amazon boat ($5 per adult). I like the cruise as very relaxing when ""tour"" around the reservoir.

During the visit, we saw male panda lying on the ground and eat bamboo, while the female panda only came out a while and quickly went back to her cage.

Tip:
1) River boat ticket can be bought right in front the entrance to boat ride. As this ride fully depend on weather, so buy the ticket inside will be better as can confirm the weather is good.

2) mosquito repellent is recommended.",06-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:59:40.588742

One of the traps of doing it this way is that the river safari which you usually arrive at at 2pm takes only a couple of hours to complete. The tour guide doesn't go with you. They just hand over the tickets and give you the instructions. The night safari however doesn't open until 7pm which leaves you 2.5 - 3 hours with time to kill. Not an easy feat unless you pay the extra to enter the zoo area. The exhibits are very good and seeing a panda is always a treat but it's not guaranteed. The Amazon river boat is a nice way to go around but again because the boat is on a preset course by the time you hear the information you have either moved past the exhibit or not actually seen anything because that's not a guarantee either. The lake cruise spends 15 minutes on the water but unfortunately for us we heard nothing of the commentary due to some of the other passengers. The large aquarium at the end is well worth the look. Food options are limited at the river safari end. You are better off walking up towards the night safari end where there is at least more of a selection. Food is still quite expensive for the quality. If I had my time over I probably would forgo the river safari as part of a combined tour option and stick to either the zoo or the night safari.,06-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 03:59:40.952256

The whole experience was intuitive. The walk paths are easy to follow and there are a lot of things to read about the animals along the way. The park is clean and extremely organized. but be warned, since everyone is following along the same path, it can get crowded at some points.

We really enjoyed the area of the dugongs and also that of the catfish and stingrays. There were benches available so that one can enjoy watching the fish as they swim around. An absolute treat if you love fish and reptiles. Oh and make sure you check out the habitat of the pandas. The animals are really interesting to observe in their ""natural"" environment.

The cruise and the boat ride was okay, just to experience it but it isn't something i'd try again. But we did go around the park twice just to see if we missed anything. (We didn't).

Having grown up in Singapore and spread high merit for the Zoo to all those who asked about it, I unfortunately had not gone back for over 10 years, and of course new attractions had been developed and implemented.

With that said, I purchased a 4-in-1 pass to all of the parks for my girlfriend and I. Aside from the fact that their website would not accept my AMEX (where you get a discount) but the onsite counter would (full price), I was intrigued by the idea of a River Boat tour of the animals.

Safari River Boat Tour- not worth it at all. I was immediately disappointed by the fact I had paid to go on a circular tour of a tiny part of a river which merely showed me the back of the enclosures I had just paid to enjoy at the actual zoo (which provided better views). With the conductor advising all that we MAY see certain animals, I felt taken advantage of and came off the boat in a slight rage haha

HOWEVER, we then paid an extra $5 for the Amazon Boat Ride (as we had already paid S$120) and before entering I noticed a pelican with his trainers so naturally I wanted to go play with the 4ft tall feathery friend. Really glad I did, as it immediately made me happier and whilst talking to the trainer and discussing the birds personality, we were even shown the impressive stretching capability of his mouth (see photo below).

Once we ventured into the Amazon Ride, the log flume esc style ride was an alternative and enjoyable way to see the animals of the South American rainforest.

The above experience coupled with a large aquatic display with dugongs and giant fish and also a close up look and both the red panda and the super chilled black and white pandas was a delightful end to the River Safari.

Although I would not return (as I have now experienced it), I would recommend that people attend as it was a great alternative way of experiencing the animals.

The easiest way you can reach here is by a cab, which will take about 30 minutes from the city. You can also reach here by public transport bus or by MRT NS-Red line and then a connection bus or cab.

River Safari includes a boat ride through Mississippi, Congo, Nile, Ganges, Mekong and Yangtze rivers. You can also see the Giant Panda Forest, Squirrel Monkey Forest and the Amazon Flooded Forest. Tickets can be purchased on-line or at the ticket counters at the Singapore Zoo or River Safari.

The Amazon River Quest is a 10 minutes boat ride for SGD 5, which features different types of fishes, alligators and animals living by the side of the Amazon River.

You may not view all the animals during this short boat ride. If you have enough time, it will be better to cover the area on foot, which will give a better chance to view the animals. Otherwise, the boat ride by itself is a waste of money. If you sit in the front row of the boat, you can get wet as the boat goes through some dips in the ride.

Other than the boat rides, you can see the world’s largest freshwater aquarium and the Giant Panda Forest and the Squirrel Monkey Forest.

The best part of the trip was the Giant Panda Forest. The queues are quite long, so better to do it in the morning as the park opens. You can also see the red pandas here.

Another interesting area is the Squirrel Monkey Forest, where you will find the squirrel monkeys all around. They are quite amusing and you can photograph them from very close.

This place provides a truly unique view on some of the world’s most fascinating freshwater ecosystems with plenty of great fish, manatees, and many other animals to be seen at very close proximity.

And all this in a way, which at least appears to be as sensible as possible to the animal’s needs. It's a great place for kids, but at the same time also provides plenty of complementing information for adult visitors. Overall, a great place for everyone to go.

I am not sure if I understand how the Pandas fit into this “freshwater ecosystem”- concept. But having seen the two big Pandas plus a very cute Red Panda -all of them behaving incredibly relaxed -has definitely been a very highlight of this trip to Singapore.

How to go there?
This place is in immediate proximity to the Singapore Zoo. Although pretty remote in the North-western part of the island, you can easily reach it via MRT (taking the North-South Line to Ang Mo Kio - NS16) followed by a ca. 35 minutes bus ride. The line #138 is starting at bay 1 of the bus interchange (just follow the signs) and is ending at Singapore Zoo.

Unfortunately the ""river safari"" part was under refurbishment, which they failed to inform me when getting my tickets and the pandas were also not in thier enclosure due to keepers cleaning (which obviously needs to be done, but maybe not at peak times).

The River Safari is a unique type of exhibit. Think of it like an aquarium, except it also includes the river bank and the plants and trees above the water - from all over the world. Most of the exhibits are stunning - they allow you to see both the life IN the water as well as on the banks. I spent about 2.5 hours and I wish I had more time to read all the signs and learn more about the different rivers.

The River Safari for some reason includes pandas. The exhibit is unique - it is indoors, air conditioned, and you kind of walk through/over the enclosure, so you get a lot of panda viewing opportunities if they're awake/active. On the day I went, the panda was quite playful - walking around and climbing around a big tree branch.

DON'T do the the River Safari / Reservoir Tour. I spent 40 minutes in a hot line to get a 15 minute boat ride around the reservoir and saw ZERO animals. Super disappointing.

This is a 3-parts re-visit review to the Zoo, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park (while doing new lens test as a Photography Enthusiast). If you are Park Hopping (discount bundle), please feel free to check out my other relevant reviews and hope it may help.

""Life on the River""

River Safari is a river-themed hybrid of Zoo and Aquarium that aims to present some of the habitats around the world such as Amazon Forest, Nile, Mekong River and etc.

While the Park attempts to fuse all of the above together, this is usually done on a more informative aspects through pictures and message - As a third time visitor, I did hope that they would have been able to bring more specific specimens in or introduce more new enclosures (that don't involve rides) to suit the theme. To be blunt, I believe (and judging from Visitor's response) most would be here just to catch a glimpse of the Pandas, which is good - and bad as it limits the potential of the park which can be so much more.

Tips/Advice:-

1) As per my visit on the 12th Nov today, the Red Panda exhibit is closed till 26th Nov for upgrades, fyi.

2) Preferred Time of Visiting? Week day is recommended to avoid the crowds (both tourists and locals) and It is good to visit at exactly 10 am (when it opens) and having the Panda exhibit all to yourself for that few moments.

3) Admission Fee? Its $30 for adult, $20 for child and usually some discounts will apply when you buy via Online for Locals. One should consider the multi-Parks special (check out the ParkHopper Special) to enjoy a decent discount

4) Location : it be best to take Buses here (for example, 927 from Choa Chu Kang Bus Interchange, or 926 from Woodlands to name a few), they operate late into the nights to accommodate for visitors who may have stayed to visit the Night Safari

5) Preparations : Definitely wear comfortably (shoes and clothes) and also study the weather precipitation beforehand.

My sincere suggestions for the Zoo/River Safari:

1) I do hope as part of an ongoing effort - Wild Amazonia (Amazon River Quest) can be made accessible by foot as well, if even partially. At the current moment, it is a ride based experience which is fun and good but often so rapid that we will capture little to no details/content.

2) As part of the Park Hopper bundle and experience, maybe you can look into covering the costs of transports between Zoo/River-Night Safari to the Jurong Bird Park which as of now cost between $4-6. I do think the cost of transport is marginal as compared to driving the crowd flow to visit Jurong Bird Park too, which is currently awkwardly situated away from the 3 other parks. I believe the gesture of waiving the Transports cost to Jurong Bird Park will for 1) boost traffic heading to Bird Park due to the ease and cost of transferring and 2) encourage people to buy 4-parks Park Hopper bundle.

As always, do refer to my Photos for visual and thank you for reading.",11-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 04:01:10.915681

Taking the tour this afternoon I had two hours in which to complete and return to my tour bus. It may sound a bit quick, and were I a family with young kids keen to explore and understand all before them it would have been an ask, but as a solo visitor I even had time for shopping and Starbucks.

There were a lot of tanks to view, I quickly passed these, stopping only briefly and reading the text. What was more interesting was the pandas, many were paused here for a gander.

There’s a food area directly after the pandas before you cross the water for river boat rides. Our ticket got us the amazon boat ride, you get a bit of a splash ride, my first such boat ride, and was a bit of fun. The ride was a bit quick and sunlight made it difficult to effectively photograph animals on the 10 or so minute ride. Wait times can be long, I was lucky and only waited maybe 10 at most.

So it wasn't a boat ride to see all the exhibits. It's half By foot half by boat at $5. The boat ride was too short but able to resit, just avoid crowded days. We were lucky on the reservoir boat ride to see the elephants! Other than that I thought there were more rooms of improvement to this reservoir boat ride. Note: 2 different boat rides, reservoir and Amazon.

We took the Teahouse sampler set which was very decent with the Pork Bone soup, taupok, goh hiang, char siew, roasted pork and one entire pot of tea! Not fantastic quality but really edible and rather delicious. Definitely worth the price!

Feeding times were in a smooth motion no need to rush here and there. We spent 9.40am - 12.30pm there!

The place is set up as a loop so you'll likely to cover most thing as you go along the path. The main attractions in this place are the pandas and the few big aquariums showing the manatees and the bigger size fish.

The free River Safari Cruise is a simple slow and relaxing journey of the reservoir. The announcements about seeing the animals are kind of pointless as it only shows a small part of the few animals from the Singapore Zoo from the reservoir's side. You get to see a little close up sample of a giraffe's poo and hair during the cruise.

I did not go on the Amazon River Quest (need to pay separately for SGD5 per adult) due to the possibility of getting soaked (mentioned on the entry board).

Worth visiting this place. It is more value for money if you visit multiple zoos (Night Safari, Singapore Zoo, Jurong Bird Park) together with this attraction with a multiple entry pass. There's also the yearly pass which is more suitable for locals.",09-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 04:01:30.095961

This park is alot smaller than the zoo and unless you go on the boat rides, you will be done in less than 1 1/2 hours. There is a free boat ride around the reservoir and another one which costs $5 where you are supposed to be able to see some animals.

There was an adorable red panda housed in the same part as the pandas as well. The lively otters were another highlight for me.

River Safari is well laid out and informative with fish and wildlife grouped according to which major rivers of the world they are from. The Amazon River Quest (an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) lasts around 10 minutes and is worth doing to see the majestic jaguar, whereas the River Safari Cruise (also an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) that lasts for around 15 minutes was a bit dull and you do not get to see very much wildlife on it.

3 hours is sufficient to cover every bit of the attraction as this is the smallest park out of Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. For dining options, there is a panda themed cafe called Mama Panda Kitchen that does cute panda decorated buns but I did not eat here as I thought the prices were a bit expensive and heard that the food tasted a bit bland (although you would get a fantastic view of the reservoir if you ate here!).

Walks in the park is nice. Well shaded. There were some interactions with the staffs for knowledge, for eg at the entrance, there was a small booth and the friendly staffs were there to explain the designs of some tools / toys for the birds. Which is quite an interesting topic i'd say.
Toilets are clean.
Easy to navigate. Plenty of rest areas.

On the plus side the pandas and manatees are really the only exhibits worth seeing and I am glad I went purely because I got to see a panda. The Amazon River ride was also good fun and well worth the extra cost. Without doing this ride there is little other reason to go to the River Safari at all. Many of the animals were not to be found on the day of our visit and the reservoir boat ride is very ordinary. You need at least two and a half to three hours to see everything, not because there is a lot to see but because it can be quite crowded and it's difficult to get a good look at the exhibits.

The River Safari combines the best elements of all other Singapore attractions: The Zoo, SEA Aquarium, Universal Studios (because of the Amazon Quest ride) and even Gardens by the Bay (because of the pandas climate controlled zones).

1. Go on a weekday if you can - fewer people
2. Buy tickets online in advance to avoid line. If purchasing on site, remember that all parks use the same ticket counter near the zoo entrance.
3. Try not to do the exhibits in reverse order (don't start with the Amazon exhibit). While there's no issue doing that on weekdays, there is a bit of backtracking involved if you do them in the reverse order.
4. If you want to see the pandas up close, you may have better luck during feeding time. We were there at ~3 p.m. and both pandas were out front eating, giving us a great view.",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 04:03:17.966867

Park is next to the Zoo, so would be easy to do both attractions together.

Park is well set out and the highlight was the Panda Bears, squirrel monkeys and Manatees.

Would recommend taking a snack as there is not really anywhere to eat inside. Starbucks is located just outside the exit and there are other eateries near the ticket office.

River Cruise was only about 15 minutes and was pleasant but not fantastic. We did not do the other boat trip as this was an additional charge and appeared to be for children as we did not see too many adults do this.

It’s a walk of about 1.5-2 kms in total when u walk all around from place to place to boat rides to back to the main areas etc.. but you don’t really realize it and that’s the best part..
The weather was perfect - cloudy and not much of sun so I enjoyed the trip with my mom.. only thing missing is variety for vegetarian food.. it’s only pasta in tomato sauce and pizza slices and the prices are steep so I recommend you fill yourself and then enter here and later can have an ice cream or some snacks inside.. carry your own water bottle as there’s a lot of places to refill water inside there as well.. strict vegetarian (w/o onion garlic ) May find it difficult to find food here so either carry sandwiches with you or eat a heavy lunch and then enter this place and enjoy for 3 hrs or so and then go back and eat wherever you prefer in the city..
The 2 pandas have their eating resting times so must be patient to see them
The red panda moves freely and is very nice to see it in such open place..
a lot of monkeys and A lot of manatees .
The boat ride specially the free one is very laid back and has not too much to offer compared to the other one but it’s v relaxing to see the greenery and serenity in this part of singapore..

2 kind of cruise available
-River Safari Cruise
Boring 15mins ride, I would say ride if your legs are tired but waiting time 20-30mins most of the time
-Amazon River Quest $5/adult $3/child>1.06m
10mins ride, if you paid to come in just pay the extra $5 to ride this. This is what deemed by many as the ‘main attraction’

Good place to relax is Amazon Flooded Forest basically a dark cave-like with limited seats to enjoy views of manatees, catfishes and other fishes again

Only one restaurant inside which sells mostly Chinese food (non-halal) because of the panda. It is kind of like a panda theme restaurant with minimal design and some limited cute panda buns, latte and souvenir cups.

As the river safari, zoo and night safari are all located near each other (5-8mins walk), there are plenty of food options outside these parks.

Could be potentially boring to kids as well as there are no child’s play areas, big majestic animals and animals shows.

It was not that awfully crowded. We had an elderly amongst us. Fortunately wheelchair could be easily requested from the customer service.

It was a simple walk through the sheltered park. The variety of river life on display was vast and captivating. All of us enjoyed it. The highlight was the pandas. We were lucky to be able to catch one of them awake and eating. The other was asleep. Well, of course the other enjoyable thing was that this area is air conditioned, so a good change from the hot weather outside.

The river cruise was just a leisurely 10-min cruise out onto the waters and back. Nothing very spectacular. The other boat ride which we had to pay was more exciting. Go on it to find out.

The rest of the route back was not to bad, continue viewing the river life. My friends who had never been there before found the place interesting.

Overall experience was so-so.

Parking there for a whole day is reasonable. But you probably need only about 2-3 hours and you can finish walking around the whole park. Food in there is nothing to shout about and pricey.

I think if you have friends visiting, the zoo is a more fun place to visit. Need more time for that. But the river safari is weather-proof- rain or shine, you can go! It is also wheel-chair friendly.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 04:03:53.169674

Unfortunately those were the few highlights for me as I am not terribly fond of fishes (and trust me, there were loads of them). The river cruise was calm and relaxing but was essentially a ride in a reservoir, while the Amazon River Quest boat ride was cool but finished way too quickly for the extra money paid.

Another downside of the park is the lack of affordable & tasty food options.

The zoo is definitely worth a visit but the River Cruise does not justify the hefty price tag.

Following the zoo which is full of animals, the River Cruise seemed rather on the sparse side and there was little to see.

The majority of the most interesting animals (particularly of the mammals) can only be viewed by purchasing additional tickets for the Amazon River Quest ride $5 per person). Even then seeing the animals is entirely dependent on your party having the good fortune to sail past when they are at the front of their enclosures (a chance significantly depleted by the tropical downpours of Singapore).

The park is well designed and could make for an interesting day out but it's not a patch on the zoo and at the moment, not worth the additional price tag.",04-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 04:03:54.673328

Our favorites were the manatees, giant Mekong catfish and sturgeons. Keep an eye out for the baby manatee - too cute!

The river safari is you walking along tanks made up of fish etc from different area of the world. It's ok....

They have a boat ride that costs $5.00 (you can purchase tickets beside the ride) Wait time was 10mins and you are basically going on a boat ride like a theme park with animals beside. Some are impossible to see. I am not sure if I would do the ride again.

There is another boat ride which apparently takes you around the lake. The wait time for that was 2 hours so we didn't do that one. But it is free.

I took the river safari cruise (include in standard ticket) which is soothing, and along the 15min ride, we could see girrafe, rhinos, few birds and watchout for wild animals too, i've saw a monitor lizard swimming in the river :D

We also saw many different species during our walk, especially some big alligators and some cute little monkeys. Sadly, the pandas were not easy to see and didn't look well cared for. The highlight for us was the manatees, such amazing creatures and fascinating to watch - you can spend a long time with them. The included boat trip was disappointing, just a 15 min trip around a lake with a few glimpses of storks.

It was my first time to see the full safari including a boat trip. We started at around 11am and left around 2pm including a lunch stop by the water. There are some real plusses to this attraction. It is, like nearly everything in Singapore, very well managed and maintained. The super large fish and aquatic tanks are great. Manatees/Dugongs and fish bigger than people are a sight to behold. The challenge, presumably at that time of day (it was hot and sunny) is that many of the animals are missing in action. One of the giant pandas was absent. But especially on the boat trip (not across the lake but around an artificial river with rapids etc.) No monkeys. visible and quite a bit else hiding. The sleepy and beautiful jaguar was the highlight. One note for the more dynamic boat trip is don't take it if you have a bad back - there is some rapid acceleration and you will get bumped from behind at the end (it should be easy to fix this I would have thought).",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:29.893364

The areas are divided up amongst many important rivers of each continent, including animals, fish, and information not the eco systems. They have some very large tanks that include large animals like alligators and manatees. There's even a chance to see a couple of pandas. Well worth the fee; fun for family and friends.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:30.245112

The thrmepark named River Safari because it characterised into 5 famous rivers in the world and the natural habitat for the living things to live in.

Example:
1. The Nile - The Nile crocodile etc.
2. The Amazon River - The piranhas etc.

However the main highlights in River Safari is still the pandas Jia Jia / Kai Kai. There's also a panda cafe that sells snacks.

There's a river cruise available at a fee. Not very big. Can be completed about 3 hours.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:30.644071

But went it to see Panda, which was amazing. The animals and other aqua stuffs are the same that you would have seen in zoo and aquarium. We doubt on the safeness of visitors, as a large reptile was roaming around freely on 15-05-2016 after 6.30 PM. I noted it and found it very difficult to find help to inform the workers. There was no emergency button kind of thing. Also it was very dark as most of visitors didn't notice the reptile. The scariest moments of my trip.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:36.817601

We paid the extra to go on the river safari which we loved, best ever boat ride. We were told that we'd get wet so we put our cameras in our bags but we didn't even get splashed and wished we'd taken photos. Perhaps it was because we were the only ones in our boat and it was lighter.

The pandas were worth seeing and we enjoyed the river cruise too which was very relaxing. We went the wrong way round everything but thought that actually suited us better.

The otters weren't out first time round but by the time we got back they were zooming around their pool. We went back back to see many animals (here and at the zoo) that were hiding or sleeping out of sight and were not disappointed.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:37.177415

The boat ride on the lake wasn't worth taking and certainly wasn't worth $5. We missed the second boat ride because we had already been charged an extra $5. for the lake boat ride and felt we had already paid enough. We felt cheated as, except for the Pandas, we only saw fish. Could not recommend as good value.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:37.532739

This mad our experience a little rushed and noisy. The park is set out in the different major river systems of the world. Many types of river fish and animals. The highlights are the Red Pandas, Giant Pandas, Giant Otters and the Amazon River Cruise. The Amazon River cruise is an additional $5 ride but well worth it. The ride is in an amusement type boat that travels along a narrow river path. We were able to spot all of the animals along the way from Jaguars, different monkeys, birds, giant anteater and more. If you don't see them all the first time it is worth the $5 to go again. We were able to do a second round but didn't see all the animals the second time.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:37.885948

Plus boat ride was so childish as there was no great view at all other than seeing some animals from zoo safari. The adventure ride was better. The highlights are the pandas n the view of polar bear from one window panel, both of them thrilling to watch.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:38.200256

Which was great for us, and we had no problem getting around or seeing exhibits and lines for the Amazon River Quest cruise were non existent! Having been to Singapore Zoo & the Night Safari we were keen to visit this one. And id say, if you were short on time in Singapore and wanted to visit one of the zoos of aquariums, this is probably the one to do, as it is a pretty unique concept as far as zoos go and has a bit of everything- animals, fish, ocean mammals and birds. Best of all, it's all completed undercover! The park encircles a corner of the reservoir and so the overall experience is peaceful and serene! The rivers of the world exhibits are probably the least exhibiting or eventful although the Yangtze River aquarium is quite awesome with its giant catfish. The Mississippi River exhibit had information about beavers but none on display- that was probably the only disappointing part of the visit. The panda forest exhibit is incredible!! And you are able to get such an amazingly close up view of the two giant pandas! Although we could only see one red panda, it was very cute indeed! The panda pau buns at the mama panda cafe are a tasty and affordable novelty treat and definitely come recommended. The Amazon River Quest ride is an absolute must do and we really have to encourage River Safari to include this in park admission even if it means charging more as this, along with the pandas and flooded forest, really is a highlight of your visit to River Safari! Spend the $5, you won't be disappointed. This ride is really want sets River Safari apart from any other zoo we've been too!",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:38.570916

Its a mostly walking zoo with a river safari (10mins) and Amazon river quest for 15mins max (extra $5). Otherwise you walk and explore as you wish. It is mostly based around underwater animals, lots of fish/marine life to see. But its great as a different way to explore a 'zoo' and would still recommend to do it!",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:38.895776

There are some very cool large aquariums with manatees otters and catfish. There is two boat options as optional extras $5 each one is like a theme ride on a boat on metal rails in a water cannel through enclosures but it goes quite fast but very tame you will not get that wet if at all wet. You see leopards, big anteaters and tapirs. NB you can ride again for free just take right turn before exit and join the que again!!!! the other is a river boat cruise which i didn't do. take water with you as not many drink machines or water fountains.
Exhibits are quite spread out need to be able to walk a bit .
Definitely worthwhile if you have already done zoo and bird park before but it would be third option if you haven't done others",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:39.226202

See the zoo by boat in the only zoo on earth with one, why not? Unfortunately the tour itself was mostly walking related, which would br fine if the boat trip was worth it in the end. The hostess was kind and friendly but you only get to see 3 animals, if you see them at all. The amazon boat trip is more worth it, but costs extra. The highlight is by far the otters and if you're lucky you'll get to see them during feeding time.

,1,22,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Trevor W,341773433,22-01-2016,3,River Safari and Night Zoo - elephant's constitution needed,"I wouldn’t recommend the combined River Safari and Night Zoo tour – unless you have the constitution of an Asian elephant.

It is basically two tours and lasts 9 hours. The “saving” advertised by combining the two tours can only be in the transport cost - in that you are only transported once instead of twice to the location.

We went by bus from our hotel. There was a guide on board who had an American accent.

She so brow beat us with details (mostly unnecessary) in a loud voice that by the time we reached the destination we were thoroughly confused and our heads were spinning.

It would have been simple to say the tour was in two parts, we leave you first at the entrance of the River Safari with a map of the place and give a short address at the commencement. Instead we were lambasted with an over-load of detail which left us none-the wiser.

The River Safari is basically a series of acquariums and fresh-water displays of various animals and fish. There is a Giant Panda display – well one Panda on the day we went, the female was reportedly pregnant and must have had a headache. She didn’t appear. There are apparently ever only two at most despite being billed as S.E. Asia’a largest Panda display. I suppose that is fair enough when there are so few in the World.

There are two trips by electric-motor launch, one at each end of the place but for some parsimonious reason only 1 is included in your ticket. The other is $ 5 extra.

The boat trip we went on was far from impressive – no longer then 10 minutes – but we did glimpse a couple of elephants, two giraffe and a rhino in the distance.

The place was jungle-heat hot and humid. We lingered as long as we could at the Panda display which was Arctic cold - and heaven.

The Zoo by night tour started later in the evening. We had been to the zoo before. The heat and and humidity drove us over to the cab rank early – and home to the air-conditioned hotel. We didn’t go to the zoo.

The panda showed a lot of action that day though, drawing a lot of excited crowd.

I really enjoy the information provided in this place.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:04:46.512405
