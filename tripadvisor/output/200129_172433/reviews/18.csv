I can imagine people with allergies might have a problem in here. It's just as big and beautiful as the cloud forest except there is no waterfall. We got to it late and only had an hour before it closed so we had to rush and we were already tired from walking in the gardens and cloud forest.

The dome is designed in such a way that you visit different stations from different countries. Though I rarely focus on where flowers are from, it is very important that you read all the placards on this occasion as they add meaning and makes you appreciate the beauty of the world.

We were lucky to be visiting at the time when a Tulip festival was going on (Till May 20th 2019) and we had a sneak peak into the Kukenhoff festival from Netherlands with a mock Windmill in the flower dome!

All kinds of flowers are on display and the flower dome is also a photographer's paradise.

A Quick walk would need about 30 minutes (assuming you are here to see the flowers and not just walk), but plan to spend at least 1 hour and keep additional 30 minutes if you are a photo freak!",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 00:29:57.708985

Do take time to explore the longstanding exhibits of plants that belong to the different zones around the world, amazingly all united in this place.

Despite it being a gigantic dome, we're estimating it to be at least 10 levels high, on a space of at least four football fields, almost all the flowers we see every time are well nourished in this cool, air-conditioned dome. Quite a feat considering how hot Singapore is and how hard it is to even keep plants at home alive, definitely much harder at this scale! Always a great place for inspiring one to set up green corners at home!

We recently visited the Flower Dome and enjoyed it so much we hope to come back when family comes to visit. It is also a great place to go to escape the heat and humidity! The exhibits are well done and pleasing to the eye. We were there during Christmas so we got to see the place all decorated for the holiday. Luckily we were there when the crowd was manageable but it seemed to get even busier later in the day, so maybe go earlier to avoid it being too crowded. We were thinking more people came later to stick around to watch the first light show in the super tree grove. Anyway, the Flower dome has a great variety of flowers and plants as well as wood carvings and other forms of art. This is a great addition to put on your list of places to visit while in Singapore. Don't forget the cloud forest. We bought a pass that included both.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 00:30:43.449619

Yes, the blooms are lovely. Yes, perhaps, this is a real attraction for a certain group of tourists. Most of the flora are from temperate areas except for the desert plants and cacti, I guess. Most people I see visiting this place are from temperate countries. I don't necessarily think they will be gushing over the blooms in this place.

The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are pretty symbolic in reminding people that Singapore is a bubble. Great for a visit, has all the first world comforts, but probably ambivalent to reality in other parts of Southeast Asia. So, if you are traveling in the region, please don't just stop in Singapore - which is a real amazing international hub.

Like the Cloud Forest, it is housed in a futuristic building made of glass and steel.

As you enter the flower dome, you get a feeling that it is an awesome place.

The flower dome has gardens from South Africa, South America, the Mediterranean and Japan. The variety of flowers is incredible - all very colourful and pleasing to the eye.

There were shrubs too and some were shaped. The flower dome has been designed to showcase the wonderful variety of flowers. In the South Africa Garden were some sculptures of animals.

The Japanese garden was very pretty. It had lots of cherry blossom trees. I spent a long time admiring the beauty of this garden.

There was an exhibition - Sakura Matsuri - at the time of my visit in an hall. There were many things showcasing Japanese culture and products.

i would recommend a visit to the Flower Dome.

Located in the Garden by The Bay, it is a place you have to go when you are in Singapore.

How to get here?
Flower dome is one of the conservatory that Garden by The Bay have. To reach here, you can choose Bayfront MRT station as your destination (same destination with Marina Bay Sands). It was a clear direction in the exit. So you can easily find the way to get here.
Personally, I recommend you to use shuttle service which takes
SGD 3 per passenger (no fee for my 2 y.o child). Because it will be so hard to to walk in the sunny day by bringing stroller. It also needs more than 15 mins walking. So, shuttle service is the best way. But if you have long time to explore each spot of the Garden by The Bay, it's not a bad choice to walk.

What can be seen here?
Flower dome is a indoor garden which full of plant. You will not easily get bored because it is a new experience to explore the area. It's a good place too for your children to learn about plant.
In the first area, you will see succulent (cactus family) and any other greenery. Then you will see a lot of flowers in the next area.
Don't forget to take some pictures here because there are a lot of spot to be taken.

‚òâ When is the best time to go here?
Go in the morning before sun is shining to high. After reaching here, don't worry about the weather because it is a fully air conditioned area.

What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Because again, you need to walk more here.

Admission
In the official website, the admission is
- SGD 28 for adult
- SGD 15 (3-12 y.o)
- Free for kids under 3 y.o
(The admission for 2 conservatories, incl Cloud Forest)

Do you feel a ""but"" coming on?
The forest dome next door is awesome. It puts the flower dome in the shade. To do each dome justice, would take 3 or more hours each. That is a lot of flowers in one day and probably too much. If you have oodles of time, then break it up.Don't try to get two domes and the supertrees and the lightshow done in one day it is too much.
If you do not have this much time, then the flower dome is definitely the inferior one to miss. If you do go to both, make sure flower dome is first, because I did it the other way round and flower dome was an anticlimax that I had to rush around.

I have been the to the flowerdome 5-6 times in the last few years. Just when i thought I'd seen everything with the usual temperate spring flowers, I heard about the cherry blossom displays. Being a regular visitor to Tokyo's parks during cherryblossom season (at least once a year) I felt I didn't need to check out the cherry blossom displays at the flower dome. I mean-why bother?

This year I had to miss Tokyo in springtime and decided to get my cherry blossom fix in Singapore.

My goodness. It was impressive. The variety! The colours ! The sheer number of trees. I even pretended I was in Tokyo. The visitors loved it. I loved it.

I also visited in April when there was a tulip display. The varieties of tulips were amazing !

Come one, come all -don't miss the flower dome.

There are some lovely restaurants there-one within the dome and a chinese one just outside. They are not easy on the pocket but the food is fantastic.

If you rode on a little tram from the ticketing area (near bayfront subway) to the flower dome/cloud forest and paid for a return journey, please note that once the flower dome /cloud forest closes, there would be no trams travelling back to the original location. Best to leave the flower dome / cloud forest an hour before closing to ensure you get to ride on the tram.

Both facades are of irregular hyperbolic shape. One glass house is higher than the other. If the higher one is a mountain, then the other one is a hill. You can also say that they look like giant ocean waves.

The lower glass house is FLOWER DOME & the higher one is CLOUD FOREST. Together with the SUPER TREE GROVE they form the famous award winning THE GARDENS BY THE BAY.

The FLOWER DOME occupies 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) of land & is a 38-metre (125 ft) high glass house. If that is not impressive enough, then you must also know that the construction has NO supporting column at all.

Once you step into it, you are at a constant 23 ¬∞C to 25 ¬∞C environment throughout.

The Flower Dome has a great collection of flowers & plants displayed in 7 different gardens (cactus garden, etc.) & a central changing display field for flower shows, all under one no-column glass-house roof.

So comfortable that for me, half a day is too short to be in FLOWER DOME alone. You will need another day to visit CLOUD FOREST which is just opposite.",04-2017,Family,2020-01-30 00:36:19.565641

There are some interesting garden art and the transplanted olive trees are impressive but on the whole these gardens weren't anywhere near as good as the Botanical Gardens which were free.

I was disappointed in the selection of Australian natives given the range of plants they had to choose from. It was as if they wanted to give the impression Australian landscape is dull - which it most certainly is not!

Staff were rude - particularly a girl who told my husband off for sitting on a step. She could see he was

Now, we brought our overseas guests.
Currently, they are changing over their exhibits from the Chinese New Year floral displays with pagoda-like structures, so it is not so spectacular.
But in March there should be new special seasonal floral displays.
I like this attraction which appeals to both overseas visitors and locals alike.
During Christmas they have lovely stuffed toy / teddy bear and many festive Seasons displays and props.
Previous years, they also have beautiful tulip festivals during spring time.
Repeat visits are also enjoyable since they change their seasonal exhibits regularly.
I particularly enjoy this large greenhouse attraction since it is a great escape for either inclement rainy or sunny weather.
But do bring a sweather or light jacket if one is inclined to feel chilly, since the temperature is kept cool at around 23 to 25 degrees celcius.
This conservatory replicates the cool-dry climate of Mediterranean regions like California, South Africa, South America etc.
This is a wonderful place for capturing beautiful shots admist myraid of georgeous and colourful flora and plant displays, which can be enjoyed by young and old.
The best part is that the entry fees are so affordable.
For overseas guests, it is SGD28 for both conservatories.
For locals, the senior citizens prices are lower at SGD15 only.
Check for certain credit card discounts, when purchasing tickets.

- the air is very fresh here
- wide range of flower and plants.
- during our visit they made a very good Christmas decoration together with flower and plants that related to festive season ( of course they are real not the plastic one! )
- a good place to bring kids. They can learn and see nature
- also a good place for elder people. They do have a lot of place to seat. So they can walk and seat to enjoy the place.
- fully air conditioned room. Its a bit cold here. If you cant stand cold its good idea to bring light jacket here.
- dont forget to bring camera to take up close flowers and plants here
- they do have cafe inside the flower dome

Cons:
- the area is not big. It took around 45 minutes to walk in normal pace
- you need to pay 11sgd for kids, 16sgd adult
- the place can easily packed with people. Try come earlier in the morning to avoid the crowd especially during holiday season

We spent about 90 minutes there because we were in a rush to finish before sunset. I recommend starting earlier and spending 3 hours. It has amazing plant life. It's Air conditioned which is lovely on a hot day.
We spent S$71 for 2 adults and a 9 year old kid to visit 2 conservatories, this and the cloud forest (also highly recommended). Also spent S$9 to catch the shuttle bus from the main gate and S$32 on lunch at McDonald's.
Our plan was the 2 conservatories, then gardens by the bay lightshow at sunset for about half an hour, then walk over to marina bay sands for the 9:30 lightshow. It worked perfectly and I recommend this itinerary. Allow at least 90 minutes per clouds/flowers conservatory, preferably more.
Tips:
1. If it's hot invest in the bus trip from the front gate, $3 per person. If not it's a long walk and you'll melt.
2. There's a great McDonald's restaurant right near the cloud forest, highly recommended and clean.
3. great on a hot day as its really cool inside (same as cloud forest)
4. Do the 2 conservatory trip as the cloud forest is great also
5. Go to the gardens by the bay light show after that.
6. Charge those camera batteries, you'll want to take hundreds of photos here!

Although we tried to go early on the Sunday morning to avoid the crowds, we saw many tour groups who thought the same too.

The flowers were nice and I appreciated having the mini write-ups that were easy on the eyes. The air-conditioning was great, especially since we spend a large part of the year enjoying 30+degrees heat.

I'm not sure about the crowds though so I'm going to say if you prefer to visit places that are not overcrowded, the Flower Dome is not for you.

However the air-conditioning and shelter is a plus point since you can visit the place regardless of how hot or how wet it is outside. We took a taxi in and it was sheltered all the way from the drop off point until the Flower Dome itself.

If you only have time for one attraction, the Cloud Forest would be a better use of your time.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 00:40:33.699591

3-appreciate the architectural dome

Tips: we bought our tickets from Cebu Travel which comes with tickets for a Singapore River Boat tour, which we feel was better value than buying the tickets onsite.

When you arrive, you would see Garden By The Bay offers its Shuttle service for $3 which was unlimited ;to and back,personally, if you are mobile, you would not need it.

Few hints:
- in the domes (flower and rainforest) it is a bit fresh. Bring something with long sleeves. I found the flower dome much more interesting. Bring also a book. You have plenty of time.
- To rent a trolley for the kids you need an ID card (e.g. passport). The rent costs you 2 SGD.
- There is the Children Garden close by, which you can in any case enter for free. That is basically a big water play area. Bring a towel and some clothes for the kids AND for you. It's fun!
- Outside tour (to be paid extra) is not worth it. Better to stay longer in the flower dome and/or children garden.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 00:41:13.168958

The flower dome is a family friendly attraction and allows for parents with babies and toddlers to freely view the exhibits without having to worry about finding a spot to sit for your tired legs, or even a changing station.

That said, I have enjoyed my view of the tulips and have taken some wonderful photos with my small digital camera. For great views of the display go up past the cacti area. Don't forget to look at the cacti on the way. They are remarkable. While the ground floor display is what draws people in remember to visit the rest of the displays to see plants from different parts of the world. Also love the statues in this dome. Because the displays change, the Flower Dome is one that you can visit at different times of the year. Look up to admire the structure of this building and look out for views of parts of Singapore.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world as listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records. It is one of the 2 Cooled Conservatories - the other is the Cloud Forest, at Gardens by the Bay. The changing display of flowers and plants at the Flower Dome is the reason for repeated visits by Flower lovers all over the world as every visit is different and refreshing.

Visitors to the Flower Dome can spend hours browsing through the many Flower and plant exhibits at the indoor temperature of 23 to 25 degrees Celsius. The Flower Dome is an ideal place to spend the day during the current hot spell in Singapore where the daily temperature is around 35 degrees Celsius.

Fortunately we had our attraction passes as part of our Singapore Airlines Holidays stopover package and these provided us with free admission to both of these attractions.
We could have spent hours in the Flower Dome as there were so many beautiful displays to see. However, as our time was limited, we admired as many of the displays as we could amongst the crowds of visitors, before having to move on.

It was my least favorite - not bad, but not exceptional. If I had to choose between this dome and the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Orchids win out. But when combined with the other three parts of the Gardens by the bay, namely the Cloud Forest dome and the Supertree light and sound show, I would be happy with the Gardens by the Bay. If you have limited time at the Gardens by the Bay, go to the Cloud Forest dome first. The 15 minute long light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45 (check website for times) would be my second pick, followed by the Flower dome.

But this problem is not a concern to you when you visit Flower Dome and Cloud Forest at Bay South Garden, one of the three waterfront nature parks built around the Bay area. When government of Singapore designed and built city‚Äôs gardens it aimed at reclaiming and preserving city‚Äôs limited land space; to create nature greenery and to advocate the quality of living in one of the smallest nations and most crowded city state in the world. Bay South Garden is the largest of city‚Äôs three gardens at Marina Bay, featuring two popular conservatories Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flower Dome replicates Mediterranean‚Äôs mild cool environment and semi-arid dry climate, provides idea environment to nurture many rare and exotic plants originally from five different continents. Visitors can learn varieties of succulent plants, unusual baobabs and bottle trees that are rare to the region; it also exhibits many theme display gardens and location-specified gardens. This world largest column-less glass dome is an ideal place for all ages whether it is for educational purpose or for leisure entertainment. You can take your time stroll around different area of the gardens, browse through some of the world most precious life plants and spend more time for whatever interesting you the most. This indoor garden and tropical forest structure is an innovative genius, designed to be environmental friendly by connecting the vent-cool system at nearby Supertree Grove where rain water is collected and then recycled to work as venting-cooling-watering functions for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It is an outstanding engineer work runs on sustainable energy to minimize the environmental footprints.

Singapore‚Äôs MRT system is an affordable way to get to Bay South Garden. You take CE (yellow Circle Line Marina Bay Extension) or DT (blue Downtown Line) Line and get off at CE1/DT16 Bayfront Station; follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay ticketing office. The admission ticket is SD $28 for the adult and 10% off for the Singapore Airlines passengers (just show your boarding pass). It covers admissions to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. The park shuttle services are available for SD $3 per person if you want to skip the walks from the ticketing area to the entrance of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can get re-entry permit by having a stamp on you hand when you exit the exhibit building. The visits to the open area of the park is free but access to the Skyway OCBC needs another ticket and only opened when weather is permitted. We didn‚Äôt have an opportunity to visit it due to the storm forecast.

I recommend that you spend at least 3-4 hours since the admission ticket covers two conservatories-The Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest and many themed gardens in the park.

When we stepped inside we saw treas that were native to the other parts of the world. We saw African, Australian and Mediterranian native plants. The number of giant olive trees really surprised me. It is incredible how they manage to keep them and other plants healthy. The part where different cactuses grow is on the other side form Mediterranean area. I have never seen so many different varieties of cactuses and succulent plants in my life. In the middle, it was an area dedicated to the flowering plants. That was where we spent the most time as it is perfect for taking macro photography of perfect flowers. On every step, you have another one just waiting to be documented in all its glory. This area was the most crowded one though, but if you have the patience that is not an issue. It would be much easier if visitors would be aware of others and not sit in the same spot forever.

The best way to skip the queue here is to buy a ticket online. I did - one hickup was that despite having a print out of the ticket voucher I had to pick up the physical ticket from the One Drive shop inside the Shoppes at Marina Sands. An avoidable detour.
I walked from the Marina Sands under a flyover to the Gardens by the Bay.
Entry to the Gardens is free, only the two domes are ticketed along with a skywalk.
The Flower Dome has nice spaces for children and for young people to take selfies. There is also a restaurant on the premises - during my visit, it was reserved for a private party.
Another space on the premises is used for exhibitions - during my visit, there was a Japanese exhibition plus sale on.

From olive groves to Baobob trees from Madegascar, desert cacti to South African flowers, displays of roses and all manner of flowering plants, walking around the Flower zone is a horticultural journey around the world.
The Flower zone is also used for themed displays. When we last visited, the theme was Christmas complete with very realistic artificial snow! Photo opportunities are plentiful whatever the theme.
There are plenty of places to sit and rest increasingly weary feet and any gradients are gradual. It does become busy, particularly in the themed areas but the crowds don't really detract from the overall experience.

Located in a fully enclosed and airconditioned greenhouse the flower dome displays plants from the worlds five 'microclimates', as well as a large and everychanging flower display on the bottom floor. When we visited we were lucky enough to see the Tulip display which was inspired by Van Goughs work.

Here are a few things you might find helpful if you are planning on visiting here
1) As mentioned above the flowerdome is located in a airconditioned glass greenhouse with temperatures in the low 20‚Äôs. This means it not only provides a cool reprieve from singapores often unrelenting heat but can also be visited during a rainy day.
(2) Open 0900 to 2100 so can be visited day or night.
(3) Although entry to gardens by the bay is free, it costs 28 dollars for entry into both the flower dome and the cloudforest. If you are a tourist I would suggest visiting both.
(4) To get here via the MRT go to bayfront. You can connect to this on the yellow line or switch to it from Marina Bay on the red line.

It takes around 1.5 hours to visit this attraction. If is worth combining with the other attractions of the gardens by the bay (cloudforest and supertree groove). The later has an impressive light show at 1945 so coming here late afternoon and sticking around into the early evening is definitely an option.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 00:53:43.298264

- The ticket price of 28 SGD for both the conservatories is pretty overpriced for what you get. Especially, compared to the bay south gardens outside which are free accessible.

- It was freaking cold in there, you cannot stay any longer than like half an hour. Definitely bring a jacket, if you plan to stay any longer.

- It is called ""Flower Dome"", however, the ratio of actual flowers compared to other green plants. Expecting masses of flowers, the whole ""Flower Dome"" looked pretty colorless.

Humongous in size the flower dome adores the skyline of the Marina Bay Gardens. On payment for a ticket one finds access to this man and nature made effort. The air conditioned dome is housed with flora and fauna from distant lands. The flora and fauna is such that mandates cool temperatures for survival.

I would prefer to visit such place when it has less visitors inside. Although that we visited in evenings when the crowd was big. Every nook and corner mandates a click. The serenity has been sculptured through great effort to accommodate beautiful plants and flowers.

Any amount of words shall not suffice to express the true experience that we gathered inside.

This is an visit that is well worth your time and funds. The only bit that saddened ne was the number of adults who should have known better touching flowers and leaves even though there are plenty of signs asking you not o do this!

Took the MRT to visit the Singapore Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We decided to pay $3 to take a shuttle bus from MRT station to the entrance as we knew we were going to be walking a fair bit afterwards. The entrance to the two attractions by foot is around 15 minutes. But being so hot, I thought the $3 was worth it, my opinion.

It was such a unique experience. At first when you enter the flower dome, it‚Äôs pitch dark with big digital monitors showing different stages of blooming. At first my husband thought that it was going to be just that, a digital monitor exhibit‚Ä¶ but he was blown away when he really entered the dome‚Ä¶. It was amazing landscape and any gardening fanatics can probably stay a full day there!!

Be prepare to bring a cardigan or a light jacket as it will get cold in there. Depending on how fast you walk and whether you want to take a lot of pictures, we spent around 2 hours per attraction ‚Äì it was mostly waiting in line to take a picture since it was quite crowded in there.

The cloud forest was yet another amazing experience‚Ä¶ we were inside in time for the misting so it did feel like we were walking in the cloud‚Ä¶ again, it was a bit chilly in there‚Ä¶.

Plus side is the air-conditioning is amazing; just the right amount of cool, perfect indoor location for a humid afternoon in Singapore. They actually allow guests to take a nap on the benches, and some are conveniently located under towering trees so you would feel like you are just chilling outdoors :)

Place is perfect for photo-ops, too. They style the plants and if you're not into plants like I am, you can still maximize the place by taking photos wherever you like :)

They do have a restaurant inside but we weren't able to try it as we were still quite full then.

Down side is that when we went, it was a Monday and of all days, they were doing maintenance on the Cloud Forest!

I'm not afraid to say that Flower Dome totally blew me away and was my favourite of the two.

There were so many displays - and it really is a photographers dream. Being able to photograph the flowers, displays and assorted wooden carvings. My iPhone did struggle a little I will admit with the glare but my husbands camera snapped some gorgeous photos.

We lost ourselves in this Dome for around 2 hours.

The temperature is cooler in this Dome so it's an escape from the Singaporean heat as well as a beautifully created and maintained attraction.

I have to give a special shout out to the cafe inside... it does have a lunch menu (but was booked out so if you'd like to dine there book early), but we actually got a pass out and came back for the CAKE. They had a selection and they were totally mind blowing. It was pricy (the cake) but worth every cent!

We purchased the combined ticket for both domes which was around 35$S when we visited. There was a small discount to buy the combined ticket.

If your only going to do one Dome, my advice is do Flower Dome, particularly if your into photography.

We walked across the Double Helix bridge to get to the gardens, but there is a train stop inside the Shops and Marina Bay which gets you far closer, from there it's a short walk out of the centre and out the back of Marina Bay Sands.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 00:56:05.449936

The Flower dome houses a collection of plants from around the world from desert areas (e.g. cacti) through to mediteranean areas (e.g. olive trees), arid plants (e.g. baobab tress) and more. It even has an Australian section (pines, kangaroo paws, birds of paradise plants). Lots of interesting sculptures as well - dragons, goats, eagles and more.

As it was late November, they had started displays of Christmas snow angels etc so it sort of spoilt the atmosphere a bit as I didn't think that was what the Flower Dome should be displaying but that's just my personal opinion. Still lots of nice flowers to see.

This in spite of the inclusion of ""Tulipmania"" which features a display of tulips in April and May.
Most of the plants are common Australian garden plants and better displays are seen at garden shows such as the Melbourne Flower and Garden Show. You see even less if visiting after sunset as inadequate lighting prevents you from seeing all the detail.

This was a special exhibit and ended in early May although I am sure they often have other special events going on. The flower dome is well laid out and my taxi driver recommended doing the Flower Dome first prior to the Cloud Dome, which was even more impressive. When visiting the Flower Dome make sure you visit the upper portion with the various cactus and drier trees/foliage as this too was interesting and I almost missed it as I had gravitated to the lower levels and had to go back up to see it.

Gardens by the bay will always have a special display and it would be good to read up from their webpage about the on-going events. If you are planning to visit the domes, do read up on their maintenance days as well as that would mean the dome will be closed and non accessible. The closure will be one day out of every month.

The dome is maintained at a constant temperature and is great place to escape the heat of the outside. Photographers will especially love the varieties of flowers available for photo taking.

The only disappointing sight was the blatant disregard for the plants by one or two of the visitors when I was there. Although signs were prominent requesting visitors to not touch the flowers or displays, some visitors still chose to climb over the barricades, step on the grass and pulled the leaves on the trees just so that they can pose with the tree. Due to language barrier it was difficult to ask the visitor to not cross into the restricted zone.

Being able to view the plants and flowers closely without barricades was truly one of best features of the dome. I came away from the dome easily with 100 over varieties of flowers in bloom.

Keep a lookout for some art pieces on display amongst the plants as the artwork on display also pertains to the region that the plant is from.",03-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 01:05:10.143174

There are numerous varieties of plants and flowers inside, not forgetting the cacti (cactus) that is famous from the desert.

I got a two exhibit ticket and decided to visit the Cloud Forest first. It turned to be the right decision.

The entry to exhibits close at 8.30 pm. So when I walked over to the Flower Dome they had closed the entry. I requested them saying it was my last day in Singapore and they allowed me to enter. I had only 30 minutes before it closed at 9pm.

The place is huge... but no info boards. A disappointment after the wonderful Cloud Forest. Once you exit the flower area, in the pathway to the exit gate, on the right side there are displays on the adaption strategies of plants. Those were the only impressive stuff. Dont forget to view them one by one.

At 9 pm, I exited the Flower Dome and into the souvenir shop. However, the staff was only interested in closing the shop and were ushering all visitors straight to the exit door. So I came away with no souvenir from this visit.

This is a must visit place if in Singapore.Also, budget a full day at this place. It should be wonderful during the sun light hours.",03-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 01:06:38.278920

,1,18,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/finesilver,528371508,30-09-2017,4,"Disappointing, kind of cheesy","This is one of the two domes which comprise part of the Gardens by the Bay. You have to purchase a ticket to see both domes, and each has a separate entrance ticket for a one time visit. There is a center area with some food places and a gift shops and then the respective entrance to each dome.

As recommended, I opted for this dome first as it is the more simple of the two and less awe inspiring based upon what I could read here on TA and in my tourbooks and other sites. After seeing both domes, I believe that this recommendation is spot on, see this dome first and save the best for last or you will be disappointed seeing this dome second after Cloud dome.

The dome has flowers everywhere and plants too of all kinds and from all regions of the world. Lots from the US that I had obviously seen in nature but surely 4/5 of the visitors to this Dome had nor will ever see. I saw the Botanic Gardens and Orchard Gardens all on this same day, some overlap of course here too, but beautiful nonetheless. You walk in, go right and there are lots of cactus and other more arid plants, they are displayed well with signs describing each plant. They plants are grouped as a theme of sorts usually with some sort of sculpture or art piece, to me, some of these were very cheesy and did nothing to enhance my experience, others may have loved them though.

You then walk down kind of in a snake seeing all the levels until you are in the bottom and the center of the floor of the dome. Along the way are many species of plants and flowers from all over. You can go as quickly or as slowly as you like, lots of photo ops at every turn.

The dome itself is very cool, man made of course, perfectly air conditioned, with all natural light. In these regards, the Flower Dome is smashingly interesting. You can take tons of photos as you walk and explore both close up and even panoramic of the gardens in the dome below. Everyone is taking tons of photos so be prepared for that too pls.

There is a nice restaurant in this dome, which was closed for a private event the day I was there. It looked interesting in terms of setting and of its menu. I read some good reviews about it also, but did not eat there. Still, it would have been a nice stopping point.

This dome has a theme throughout the year and when I was there it was an Autumn based theme. This meant lots of yellow and orange colors and leaves changing and lots of pumpkins and gourds of all types, sizes and colors. Then, in the middle of that is this very very large kind of farmer figure to tie the Autumn theme together or to try to anyway. To me this was just very cheesy, but those visitors with families were loving it. As always, to each his/her own. Just not my cup of tea at all. There are photos of this display now in the photo section and surely on some other sites including Instagram and Youtube. Look there to see if you like the Autumn display before you go if you want to.

I spent about 75 minutes in this dome taking it all in, probably more than 100 photos too. I would recommend seeing this dome as part of any trip to Gardens on the Bay, just manage your expectations please against and contrasted to the other Dome and Super Tree Grove.

Definitely do not miss this though, even for a quick visit.",09-2017,Business,2020-01-30 01:08:14.115697

I came here during Mother's Day with a huge group of residents. To celebrate Mother's Day, participants paid $25/- each to visit Gardens by the Bay followed by a dinner at Bukit Batok Hometeam Ns club. I was assigned as a bus in-charge to bring the residents here.

It seem worthwhile as the entrance ticket is already around $25/- but we found it quite rushing. We arrived at Gardens by the Bay at about 4.45 pm and have to be at the bus bay at 6.15 pm, thus leaving less than 2 hrs for the sightseeing.

At least the tulip floral arrangement at the Flower Dome compensated me for the rush. The tulip flowers were fresh and matched well with the surrounding landscape. It was an ideal place for photography.

We were disappointed with the Cloud Forest as there was a huge waiting crowd at the lift lobby and the estimated waiting time was 20 mins. Some re-design need to be considered in the future to ensure the way up do not overly rely on the lift and thus deprived those who can climb up an opportunity to view the Cloud Forest. I left the Cloud Forest disgruntled and disappointed.

Nevertheless, the tulip exhibition was marvelous and awesome and I spent almost 2 hrs appreciating the beauty of the tulip landscape.",05-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 01:09:45.244638

The place even got lockers for rent which made our visit much more pleasant since our flight was scheduled at midnight that day and we had to bring our luggage so that after the visit we would go directly to the airport.

The seasonal flowers, like poinsettias for Christmas along with Christmas decor are rather cheesy! Its sacrilegious as Christmas IS a religious observance, reduced to nutcrackers and snow scenes? I wonder if they do that for Vesak Day or Prophet Mohammed's Birthday in this multi-religious state?
The tulips around Easter are my favorite, but no mention is made of another religious holiday - just Spring, but they do not say where? Same with Lunar New Year! I caught the Cherry Blossoms once and that was beautiful. But other times of the year, pretty floral offerings. These special floral offerings must cost a bomb.

Most flora is from the Eastern and Southern Hemisphere, with a few Western Hempishere offerings.

The Hydrangeas are impressive.

There's nothing all that wrong with the gardens, just the tourists taking selfies every minute and blocking the beauty of the flowers and scenery made this a bit annoying. I also found it a bit too air conditioned for my liking.

If you were short on time and had to decide what to do, I would opt for the cloud forest, the super trees and walking around the gardens. Having said that, if you have not seen a wide variety of flowers from the southern or eastern hemisphere, it is worth visiting as everything is conveniently located under one roof...from proteas to hibiscus and various ficus trees.

You can purchase a ticket to do the flower dome and cloud forest.

I also found that it was a bit too manicured and disney-ish for my liking. Out of all the exhibits, this might be the most kid friendly as there is a lot of sensory overload.",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 01:12:02.988595

However it was frustrating at times to find there was no plaques to identify intriguing plants or trees. And no one around to ask. Or they gave us the wrong information.

I was delighted to come across an English Country Garden along a far wall with some of the most spectacular specimens of British roses, clematis, standard fuchsias, sweat peas to name but a few that I have ever seen. But devastated to see that it was so poorly maintained and arranged that it was impossible to see all the stunning , incredibly expensive flowers planted/arranged in ways they would not be in English gardens.

Beautiful standard fuchsia in lovely pots up against walls covered in ivy. These would be open places leading the eye to other elements of the garden.

The rest of the cottage wall garden was so crammed with absolute floral jewels of English flora, a gardeners and artist dream tangled in each other and ivy that all was mostly lost in an over grown chaos. This could have been so much better.

It was painful. I reconsidered renewing my membership this month ....

But the flower dome is overall an amazing achievement and the succulent garden is superb. The present Alice in Wonderland display is a work of art.

Keep in mind that this futuristic structure is built on 'reclaimed land'. A city state short on land, big ups to SG for essentially creating a greenhouse in a park to offset the catastrophic monstrosity of MBS. These structures, one falling in the shadow of the other, are probably the most iconic symbols of SG (no, not the Merlion) and outside of Dubai, possibly the most iconic urban symbols of public futurism on this planet.

Even a child fighting with his parents when they asked him to take a picture of themselves - ""no, no selfie for you, I want a selfie*"" - and mid tantrum falling off the bench beside the orchid caterpillars and flower river, smashing his face open and leaking a pool of blood, could not spoil this outing.

SAMMY'S HOT TIP: you can always find cheaper tickets online, or book a meal at Pollen (the restaurant in the far corner of the garden) and get free entry.

It's a bit pricey at 28$ per person, but it's totally worth it. So beautiful. When i walked in, first thing that crossed my mind was how surprisingly cold the place is. Well, not cold, but quite chilly, because they keep the temperature low for the flowers so they could last long. The flowers they have there are seasonal. When i was there, it was season for lilies and oh boy, they have all colours of lilies you can imagine. Everything is picture-taking-worthy there, so make sure you bring your camera or charge your phone well before you go there so you can take a lot of pics.

One of highlight of this place is their waterfall thing, so be prepared to get a bit stuck before entering the area with waterfall since everyone take picture in front of it. Try to walk up around the waterfall and you'll see amazing view of marina bay sands thru that giant windows and view of the greeneries. Oh! and i found flowers made of Lego! it was cool, you won't notice that those are legos from a far. And there's also nice restaurant somewhere inside the dome, but i heard the food is soso and it's kind of overpriced.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:13:40.592696

When we went this Dome was set up for Christmas. It looked like a Christmas wonderland in the central part of the dome. From talking to the guys that work here, this is where they set up their seasonal displays.

There are also other garden displays in the dome covering gardens from around the world such as Mediterranean, desert, South America etc.

The other thing was that there was a flower show on here at the time, which meant that the place was literally packed. Okay, it was also a Sunday, which probably had something to do with it as well.

There was also carpets of begonias and gerberas, with wire renditions of the Big Five (including a fake lion on a manmade klip, which clearly harked to the Lion King version of Africa). It was a beautiful display, but about as authentic to Africa as the Night Safari is to a drive in Kruger Park.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:14:24.910456

There are few categories of parks in this place named by continent or regions like australia, afrika, america. In each of its categories you mau find typical flower and plants from the origine of the plant ( according to the name). interesting! I am amazed by the cactus park, incredible. It bring the sense of visiting desert.
At the main hall of this place you may also find thematic park according to the current seasons. Since I waa here during the end year surely a christmas and winter thematic presented and its incredibly beautiful. I love it",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:15:56.845521

They're usually held in April or May each year. The exhibits are stunning and beautiful. Be prepared for crowds. Bring a jacket as it gets cold inside relative to the temperature outside.

Go up to the area with the cacti - it may not seem like much at first compared to the colourful flowers below, but you get the best view at the far corner, where the wooden eagle and dragon are!",05-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:16:02.748538

There are loads of interesting and pretty plants/flowers within, and plenty of seats for you to just relax and take in your surroundings. The climate control makes you feel like you're overseas. A very nice place to just relax and enjoy the wonders of nature. Went at night so it has a very much different feeling compared to daytime. Would love to experience the Flower Dome in the daytime when it's not during peak season. (I went during Christmas so it was really crowded even at night near closing time.)",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:16:03.120021

Definitely a feast for all of us who likes to take pictures. This time around they make it to a Christmas wonderland theme, which I found really nice. But prepare yourself mentally before you visit this place, especially on holidays. A lot of tourists from Malaysia, China, and Indonesia will come here during the festive season.
If you are a Singaporean or Permanent Resident of Singapore, I recommend you book the tickets online and get it at a rate of $12 per dome. If you are planning to buy the tickets on the spot, you might waste another hour to queue and it will definitely ruin your day. If it is a hot day, it would be really great to go inside the dome to enjoy the air conditioner. But beware, a lot of people might have the same thought and end up over-crowding the area.",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:16:03.512219
