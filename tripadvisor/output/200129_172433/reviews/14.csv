It is an amazing space with a rain vortex that gushes down the core of the building over 7 storeys in height. It has lots of space to relax and chill out which iis not always easy to find in Singapore. The overall area is free and pretty amazing in itself- there are of course food and retail options surrounding it but not in an obtrusive way.
We paid an additional $4.50 per person to visit the Canopy Park which includes slides (fun for all ages), foggy bowls of mist and beautiful gardens. For additional fees you can enter mazes etc, but the basic package was enough for us to enjoy ourselves gor several hours.
It really is a magical place worth visiting if you are transiting through or live in Singapore.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-29 22:39:14.792391
,1,14,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/kjpdavid,740106736,20-01-2020,5,Spectacular!,"Another visually captivating attraction... but one that you can catch at Changi after you've just collected your boarding pass (if you're departing) or your bags (if you're arriving) and within easy reach from your terminal by airbridge.
We did the Canopy Walk (S$5- p/p) and also some last minute shopping.
Like all of the Singapore attractions that we visited, the quality of the design, attention to detail and high standards of upkeep maximizes the visual impact while the efficiency of access and amenities maximizes comfort.
We spent 1 hour at the Jewel before heading to our departure gate but you'd need half a day to go through the amusement attractions, shops and restaurants.
Will come back and spend more time when we're next back.

The place was really overcrowded and it was just very very noisy. Thankfully I had my noise cancelling earphones with me and kept plugged in during my visit.
Some shops were cramped and were split over 2 floors, they’re accessible by stairs, not the most convenient for my 75 year old mom, but they might have been targeting the younger crowd with more disposable income in this case.

It involves quite some walk from T2, though connected with a bridge. Today with a flight delay, thus spare enough time to visit this place.

If you plan to take a quick look before departing, pls reserve more time to do so. It is actually a big shopping mall, nothing relates to Changi Airport.

Also, most international airlines are located at T4. You can only reach T2 via free shuttle, which takes another 15 mins.

You need a $50 spend in the over priced shops to enter the Jewel waterfall. We spent this and more on four burgers ($80) and had the ticket given to us by my Brother in law with QR code.
Get to the entrance and line up literally everyone in line gets to the ""gate-keepers"" is queried for ages , then walks away without getting in .
Literally 10 or so people.
Weird...
When we get there the ""gate-keeper"" says we have to show receipts from meal , not the QR thingy (or maybe both she doesnt say)

Our family of 4 had a 6 hour transit at Changi en route from Australia to London. We arrived into Changi’s terminal 1 at about 630pm. We could have easily spent time wandering around the many shops in the airport terminal but instead we took our cabin bags with us, quickly and easily cleared immigration and walked directly from terminal 1 into the new adjoining Jewel complex. The Jewel is housed in a glass dome and is a massive retail shopping mall that also has a few attractions.

The main attraction is the indoor garden and rain vortex. We visited in December and in order for 2 people to gain access to the ground level of the indoor garden we had to spend 50 SGD in the Jewel complex. There was no other way to enter. I am not sure if this was because the indoor garden was lit up for Christmas, or because there was a special Christmas dance show on, plus regular (very short) light shows, or whether spending money in the Jewel is the only way to gain access to the garden year round. In any event, it was great to see the rain vortex up close.

We then made our way to level 5, which can only be accessed from lift foyers C and E. There are many bars and restaurants on this top floor of the complex, and it is also home to the canopy park and its attractions.

The canopy park seemed to be endless and it was lovely to wander around it. There are a number of ticketed attractions inside the canopy park. My family enjoyed the canopy nets (there are walking and jumping options - we chose the walking nets because the jumping ones were booked out for the rest of the evening). There was also a hedge maze and a mirror maze, which we resolved to check out next time we transit through Singapore.

Some things to note:
- Children under the age of 13 were not permitted to go onto any of the canopy park attractions by themselves and had to be supervised by an adult (thus requiring an adult ticket to the attraction to be purchased in addition to the children’s tickets). In our case, the other adult stayed with all the cabin bags!
- Entry to any of the canopy park attractions includes entry to the canopy park itself. Given one of our adults was staying with the bags and not going on the canopy nets, we were able to purchase “canopy park only admission” for 5 SGD for that person to allow them to enter the park.
- Canopy park admission includes a small number of attractions - the foggy pools (perfect for toddlers), the topiary walk, petal garden and discovery slide.
- The attractions closed at 10pm the night we were there.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:39:33.198024

A new, nice and big shopping mall! Just not my thing so ..... Visited and tried their food hall (food court) in Basement 2 called Five Spices. There is a good variety of stalls and we tried 3 of them. They are Saravanaa Bhavan ($7.50), Nasi Ayam Taman Serasi ($5.50) and Guan's Mee Pok ($6.50). Of course prices are dependent on what you order. You can refer to my photos. All served decent quality food but as expected, it is rather pricey and not a lot of food ..... understandably so given the venue location. It is not a very large food hall so the number of tables are somewhat limited. I would recommend that you transit over to the food hall in the Basement of Terminal 3. Much better if you are looking for a more ""local"" feel and larger variety and more places to sit.

Also I got some Singapore snacks..that salted eggs chips very famous at this moment in Singapore and also the Eureka popcorns (geez they have lots of flavors) ❤️ I got the white coffee flavor cuz I’m a coffee lover! They also have the lightening shows which was incredibly beautiful! People who work there are all very polite and friendly which I love. The toilets were so clean which I love it too.

The main attraction of The Jewel is no doubt the indoor waterfall and the greenery that surrounds it. The greenery is so lush that you can feel the air coming out of it. You can even smell the leaves when walking through the shopping center. The rest of the Jewel is a shopping center with well-known international brands.

I think the shopping center is definitely made with airport-goers bringing luggage in mind. The walking space is wider and the elevator capacity is larger especially weight-wise. There is a place to safely leave your luggage but it’s not that much of a hassle to have your luggage by your side.

The only place where it might be a hassle is on the 5th floor where there is an outdoor food court and it can get crowded.

We went there twice. The second time because we had some time to spare before checking in into the airport. Definitely a place to visit and given its location, a place that you have a high chance of visiting twice.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:39:52.635904

Only issue is it really 24 hours ? We landed at 3:30am and we’d told to stay in T2 because nothing but restaurants were open. We of course went anyway; child was hungry. At 4am the 5am and even 6am the only things open were the doors. Five restaurants are 24 hr though they say ... well the one we found only served white / black coffee and only plain bakery items after 6am; child wanted the advertised the ham and cheese croissant but could only have a plain one until after 6 am.

1) They have early check-in of luggages up to 24 hours before flight, only for certain flight brands though. We realized there's no need to pay for left luggage services when we could just check them in. We checked in our larger suitcase way before our flight (7 hours before) and enjoyed walking AND shopping around before checking in our now-loaded-with-more-shopping-wins-smaller-suitcase right before departure.

2) Canopy park has some ""free"" attractions included in that S$5 ticket, namely --- Discovery Slides, Foggy Bowls, Petal Gardens and Topiary Walk. Alright, most visitors know that. What we didn't know was that our kids had to be at least 110cm in order to enjoy the free slides and the S$8 Hedge Maze. Bummer for our undertall little ones. Nonetheless, the walk was still enjoyable especially if you've both young and old. It's like a mini Gardens by the Bay. Bring a light jacket as it was a little cold.

3) You can use the airport lounge right here in Jewel, without checking in! It's the only airport lounge that anyone can enter without checking in to transit. The buffet, nap pods, business rooms, shower facilities are all available at S$38 (S$27 for kids above 2yo) for three hours. Good for those in-between hours when you've already checked out of your hotel room and still have hours to spare before your evening flight... GREAT peaceful place for parking tired kids and partners while you shop... or meet business partners since they do have business meeting rooms.

4) Or... park kids and spouses at Shaw's family movie theatre - S$9 for adults, S$5 for kids above 90cm, free for those below 90cm for a show - they've ball pits and bean bags!

5) Best, really BEST angle to see the largest man-made water fountain? No, not the canopy walk that you've gotta pay S$8 for. We found the best place to view the fountain was on the free airport tram that connects T2 and T3, in transit. We just stayed on the tram a few times and found it's as close as anyone of the public can get to the fountain, and caught a rainbow reflected from the fountain because of this unique angle.

6) For Singaporeans/ lover of Singaporean food: After trying the numerous international/foreign brands of atas (read: branded and expensive) foods, we realized there's a local restaurant at B1 called, ""White"". It's like Tze Char (read: Singaporean everyday food), and they serve up pretty awesome Hokkien Noodles, Buttery Crispy Cereal Prawns, Salted Egg Yolk dishes. Great for those who miss Singapore food or have older folks with you who prefer local foods, and not having to squeeze in the food court.

If anyone from CAG reads this, PLEASE consider changing the escalators to travelators so people who have suitcases (yes you are connecting to an airport), strollers and trolleys can move up and down levels. We had to take our kids off the trolleys and carry them down the escalators each time we needed to change levels then look for new ones.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:40:29.182790

It's got all on would wish for in an airport...except soul and thoughtfulness for the traveller. So you can get into the airport and check in your bags with clever self check machines and even cleverer self bag drop areas in Terminal 1. You can then walk across to the largest indoor waterfall, that much promoted feature that is quite beautiful when you see each floor level of the concept.

Then try to see the Butterfly park and see how long it takes to get an answer from any of the airport staff as to how you get to that feature. One said go to Level 3 and walk across to terminal 3, another said you cannot get to Level 3 by lift but by elevator ....when we finally got there, another said go through security and you get to the Butterfly Park. Security , despite seeing the boarding pass and scanning for validity, said we needed to go back to Terminal 1 and go through security there and then go back to Terminal 3. When all this was done, there was no time left to see the Butterfly Park so exhausted and annoyed at the utter lack of any coherent ability of the airport or staff to offer simple instructions, we made our way to the boarding gate picking up food and drink along the way. At the boarding gate, we were told drink even bought at the airport, cannot go through the at-gate security check to be taken into the plane so we had to throw away or drink.

Are there any signs anywhere that this very peculiar practice applies to Changi....NO NO NO.

The airport is made for a concept of high tech efficiency but not effective wuth passengers in mind. What a shame it's only an airport after all. Try routing through other airports next time I think",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:40:29.891704

We stayed two days and although walked around most of the structure, we didn’t have time to fully explore as we did go on a couple of tours of the island. There was also a new attraction opening after we left so we need to go back. The indoor waterfall has a sound and light show which was cool.

The highlight of Jewel is obviously the Rain Vortex waterfall. It's quite a spectectular sight.

While we enjoyed strolling around the mall, we find that the queues for restaurants and cafes to be too long, especially at A&W. Singapore has a culture of queueing and I'm not surprised to see such long queues here, especially in such a media-hyped newly opened establishment. Better to have lunch outside before visiting Jewel, else one could starve just waiting for the food.

As for the shopping here, there is very little of anything unique, as most of the shops are the same ones you can find in any other Singapore malls. While it's quite an experience to visit Jewel Changi, I wouldn't recommend this place for serious shoppers. It's more catered towards travelers transiting in Singapore.

It’s just minutes from the different terminals at Changi Airport.

The Jewel boasts of a family-friendly cinema, a huge shopping mall which houses many international Brands from Salvatore Ferragamo to Laderach Chocolatier Suisse to Tokyo Hands to Zara, Hugo Boss, Cath Kidston and many others.

Dining: It’s a food paradise with countless dining options from Spanish to Japanese to Chinese and Western. Burger and Lobster and Shake Shack are here but I think you might want to wait for the craze to die down before trying to queue up for food. But if you are a foreigner and would like to try out decent Singaporean food at reasonable prices, just head over to the food court at Basement 1. Roast Duck, Indonesian Fare, Satay, Fishball Noodles and Barbecued Chicken wings await you.

Kid-Friendly Entertainment:
The Canopy Park at the TOP floor was great for my 5-7 year olds. Admission fees apply. It’s an air conditioned indoor playground that is similar to our iconic Gardens By the Bay which was featured in the movie Crazy Rich Asian. (Photos as attached)

Of course, not forgetting Instagram-worthy shots of the HSBC vortex. Don’t be surprised if you get too overwhelmed with crowds wanting to take wefies though. The view from the TOP floor might be worth taking a look at.

Word of Caution: visit during the weekdays as you might be swarmed with Singaporeans who are just as excited as you are to visit the Jewel. Easily accessible by train: Changi Airport stop (It takes around 35 min to get to the city)

Disclaimer: I am a Singaporean and I am proud to be one. This place is a must-visit whether you are transiting through Singapore or visiting Singapore. I would rather not jostle with crowds but you shouldn’t miss this out on your itinerary.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:41:06.357433

The walkway is quite narrow and with people watching, taking photos and walking, it can be awkward negotiating around with a suit case. The basement area is surrounded by restaurants. So there's time to linger, drink or eat while watching the cascading water. At night, it comes alive with lights. There's a short hourly light and sound performance from 7.30 pm.

This time it is stunning: the sparkling Jewel standing tall right in the heart of Changi, the efficient and beautifully landscaped Airport of Singapore.

The brand new destination connected to the terminals is garden, forest, waterfall, shops, shopping mall, restaurants, viewing galleries and playground all rolled into one giant gem. All over the vast place, one cannot help but marvel at the natural freshness of woodland. What is lacking is the filth, dust, weeds and rotting vegetation. Well over 280 shopping and dining areas and even a hotel are tucked in around the area spread over in multiple levels.

The focal point is the huge central dome, standing in the middle of the entire edifice. Jewel is justifiably proud of the the grandeur of the 40 meters-high HSBC Rain Vortex, and accurately claims it as the world's tallest indoor waterfall. This gush of water does not duplicate a natural waterfall. It is a huge circular torrential outpouring from the tall roof. It is water dropping down in the upper floors, but transform into a slide along the huge circular, transparent wall. Sound of elemental waterfall thunders down in the atmosphere from soundtrack. We visited the Jewel in the evening. As night falls, I believe, the waterfall acquires multihued splendor.

It is possible to go to Jewel after checking in from one of the terminals. But remember, one is leaving the security-and-immigration-cleared area, and therefore, go through the going-out and re-entering formalities. Luggage and wheeled bags are taboo. Conveniently, they can be safely entrusted to the baggage store.

Entry to Jewel is free now. One needs not be travelling through Changi Airport to enter. Anyone can walk into Jewel. In fact, I would suggest that unless you have a several-hours layover between flights, you would do better by not combining travel and the Jewel visit. Jewel demands and deserves several hours of unhurried, relaxed roaming.

Jewel has not completed installing all the attractions, though the areas now open do not have any stigma of unfinished work. The fifth floor Canopy Park with its manicured gardens and several play attractions will open by the middle of June.

It is already announced that the Canopy Bridge with a glass bottom, suspended 23 meters above the ground, and with fog emitting at both ends creating the illusion of waking on the clouds, will be added in June.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:41:15.718483

The first thing to view is the Rain Vortex. It's a huge indoor water fountain that is about 5 stories tall. The water falls inwards. It has laser light show nightly. Surround the vortex is the Sheshido Forest Valley - an indoor mini forest with trees, plants, flowers and bushes. At night, the forest will be lighted up beautifully, with soothing surround music. You will see many people sitting round the forest, relaxing and listening to the fountain fall, and enjoying the view of vortex. A great place for picture taking too.

After mid-June, you can try out the canopy walk and giant slide at the roof top. The kids will love it. However, remember to wear pants coz you don't want people at below level to see the colour of your undies! Oh ya, it is chargeable. Check out the price before entry.

There are many eateries in the mall, ranging from Chinese cuisines, Western delight, cafes, fast food, bakeries, snack bars, ice cream parlour to hawker food etc. You will be spoilt for choice.

1. Amazing mall and amenities.
2. Easy access to the airport
3. Good restaurants
4. Early check-in for select airlines (CHECK BEFORE GOING)

And the bad (why it is only getting 3 stars):
1. Scraping the barrel with brands. When Shake Shack has the pole position in a brand new $1.7b mall and is rubbing shoulders on that same level with Tokyu Hands and Muji, makes me worry...
2. Drop off has NO ACCESS TO EARLY CHECK IN!!! Beware. If you are thinking that this is a HK IFC style set-up, you will be sadly mistaken. The Jewel drop off is located a level above the early check-in, there are NO CARTS provided and the carts (even if there were any) are not allowed in the mall to go down to the early check-in. Horrible design and just a shame since they were so close to getting it right... How are you supposed to use the early check in if you can't even get to it???
3. Hotel: The Yotel is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is very hard to get to (up on L4), the rooms are no larger than a closet and if you have bags with you, as point 2 states, you can't get a baggage cart to take them to the hotel with you...

Even the prices in the crowded food court here were higher than their counterparts elsewhere in Singapore.

In other words, prepared for a jaw-dropping time!

When you step in, you'll be impressed by a huge 40m high waterfall, that forms the very nucleus of the complex. Called the HSBC Rain Vortex, it's the world's tallest indoor waterfall. The casade sets the tone of the whole place -- mesmerizing and simply stunning.

There's plenty of eat with local fare and international offerings littered all over the huge complex. Even if you're not hungry, you will be once you saunter pass these food outlets (seems there's more than 100 eateries and gastronomic icons housed there). Of course, you can get your retail fix readily any time of the day (you don't have to head off town with this mega mall in sight).

From the Forest Valley to the Canopy Park, the lush greenery in the complex makes it a climate-controlled indoor garden perfect for the weary traveler looking for a short respite. (Hint: Have a beer at the Canopy Park -- you won't regret it!)

Anyway........

What I like about it:

-Its easy to get to by MRT
-It's connected to all Terminals so I could leave the hotel a bit earlier just to shop and dine here.
-I was told by a sales staff at 12 cupcakes, Basement 2 eateries opens 24 hours so that's good information
-An excellent selections of eateries
-a lot of shops, e.g, big Pokemon store, and there is even a supermarket, cinema.
-Lots of stuff for kids to do on level 5; Maze garden, Mirror garden, slides, bouncy nets etc it spells fun.
-Jewel Changi mall is baby friendly with facilities for parents to make a bottle with hot and/ or room temperature water.

NOTE: Slides, Bouncy Nets, Mirror Garden are not opened just yet but it should be ready in mid 2019

If you are planning to shop and dine often at Changi it makes sense to join it's Changi Rewards program.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:42:17.422984

After walking around the building during preview, it is just a big shopping mall. Its true that Jewel does have a few more international brands that you may not get in other malls, but the price is higher.
Understand most photo focus on the water fountain, but it is very similar to the one at MBS only bigger. The place was very crowded, and most facilities are yet to open during the preview. Most restaurants are not ready for the crowd yet, so ordering food does take awhile.

The indoor greenery & the waterfall views are stunning at different levels of this building. Ample basement parking for those driving there and link bridges from T2 & T3.

Visited with family and kids on their first weekend.

Prior to entering to our preview time 7-10pm, it seem water leaking on the entrance at L1, cleaner can be seen placing the “container” on floor and cleaning the floor ...

The entire building are pretty big, to us is pretty much a combination of MBS, ION and Garden by the Bay. The 5th Level canopy bridge only open in June 10th for everyone. While only partial are open to public (never queue during the preview..)

Pokémon Outlet at L4-201/202 - maybe is soft opening hence hourly time slot entrance ticket had been given ALL away BY MORNING as per their staff mentioned!! We was still wondering, preview given 4 time slot strictly for just the 3 hour stayed which mean people had been staying in the #Jewel since morning because the last entrance time slot was 9-10pm and they had been given the ticket in the morning...

A&W located at B2-209 and required a queue of 1 hours... Never try during this visit but will do it next round.

The waterfall light show operate half hourly (last show at 930pm) not sure will this apply after it grand opening on 17 April 2019

It’s 7pm,timing was perfect & it was after our dinner(sadly we didn’t get to try any of the new restaurants or the returned of A&W due to our entrance timing,we’ll be starving if we waited).Anyway there’s lots to catch up with & eye opener,especially the very 1st time you’re there(my mum n I was).
This is amazing,awesome & beautifully architecture designs.You’ve got to really see this place in person to believe me,definitely no regrets.
Espcially for photographers wannabes,families & friends bondings/gatherings this is the new hunt!
It’s like Gardens by the bay + Marina bay sands + Airport in 1 building.It’s definitely way cooler to witness it yourselves & it’s family friendly with some play areas on the top floor(5th floor).
(*There’s signs that stated the play areas are ready on 10th June 2019.)
Seniors don’t have to worried about no resting areas as there’s plenty of wooden seats with aircon around.
It’s quite a nice stroll on the top floor(5th floor) as well.

As i’ve mentioned my mum & I we were there @ the perfect timing,we have seen the water falls & sky lights in 2 contrasts.Beautiful..(pictures that i’ve shared,below)
Aside from the water fall which was the main attraction,there’s famous restaurants & shops too.Not to forget to mention there’s also a cinema which I didn’t managed to spot.
See if you’re lucky to spot it & perhaps try catch a movie there,it’s family friendly designed as the media has mentioned.
Another reason why singaporeans loves to hang out in the airports even thou we’re aren’t travelling.✌

Remember there are options to check in early for many airlines at Jewel. Connecting to the terminals was also very easy, although the signs may be a bit confusing.

We checked out the waterfall and garden, had lunch at Express Pizza, walked around the shops, went to the movies, checked out the L5 attractions (you need to pay for these), had dinner at Jack’s Place, checked out the Vortex light & sound show (which was spectacular), checked out some more shops, took the skytrain to Terminal 4, checked out the Petal Clouds (moving art work), took the Skytrain to Terminal 2, checked out the Kinetic Rain (more moving artwork) and that was the day over. The next day we had breakfast at the Pazzion Cafe Level B1 (that was a great breakfast), took in another movie at the cinema, walked around the shops again then headed to Terminal 1 to catch our flight. Other options to fill in time were to go on one of the Singapore tours (we had already spent 6 days seeing the city but if you’re just passing through then one or both are probably worth doing).

Book your outward flight for the late afternoon, evening or night time. Allow 2-3 hours to wander around the complex, do last minute shopping and have a meal. If your shopping will be limited to carry-on items, then you can maximise your time by taking advantage of the early bag drop (up to 24hrs). Then just allow an hour for immigration and boarding time.

We happened to be here on a weekday morning after touching down from our 13-hour flight. It was 9.00am and we walked over to Jewel from Terminal 3, a good 15min walk. The directional signs are clear and precise and no issue navigating around. All T1, T2 and T3 and linked by covered walkways (and trains) here and as T4 is located further, may take the bus.

As it was still early, many shops and restaurants were not opened yet. We went by to the iconic landmark, the indoor waterfall, slated to be the biggest and tallest in the world thus far. It's nice and gigantic but I think night time view will be much nicer and more beautiful due to the lighting effects.

Luckily for us, it was not crowded and we managed to have some peace in the cooling and cosy ambience!

One can simply spend a few hours here, walking around, shopping or even dinning at the many restaurants and eateries, spreading over several storeys!

So whether you come here purposedly, or being here to catch a flight (or return from one just like me) or in the midst of flight transfer, this is surely a good place for you to spend time and chill in!

Consequently we added the Jewel to our list of must-see attractions for our short visit to Singapore.
The Jewel is the brand new large shopping centre constructed adjacent to Changi’s Terminals 1 and 3. This shopping centre is situated within the public area of the airport. The focal point of the Jewel is the massive indoor rainforest with its huge water feature and light display located in the centre of the shopping centre. Therefore anyone who is in the transit area of the airport can only visit the indoor rainforest either by one of two methods. Firstly, they can ride the skytrain between Terminals 2 and 3 and actually pass through the Jewel’s indoor rainforest on the train. The other method is to pass through passport control from the transit areas of the terminals and gain access to the public areas of the airport including the new Jewel shopping centre.
Knowing the above, after a 24 hour stopover in Singapore City, we checked ourselves and our luggage in for our flight in Terminal 3 and then made our way to the Jewel, before passing through passport control into the transit area. As a result, we had our carry-on bags with us but this was only a minor inconvenience.
We only had time to have a very quick look at the shopping centre but it seemed to be quite impressive. However, we were able to spend a reasonable amount of time within the massive indoor rainforest area itself. It was about 8.00pm on a Monday night at the attraction was teeming with visitors.
When we saw the magnificent water feature, the luscious plants and the wonderful light display we were not surprised that so many people, both locals and international visitors were taking the time to visit. It was just spectacular. We were a little disappointed that we were unable to spend more time there.
The Jewel’s indoor rainforest is highly recommended as a “must-see” for anyone visiting Singapore. We will certainly make a point of returning, the next time that we are in Singapore!",05-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 22:44:12.620291

The waterfall is beautiful and worth seeing. There are many shops and restaurants. The place is popular with locals and certain restaurants are very popular, to the extent that there were long quese to get served. If you are not bothered about being trendy there were plenty of other places without queues. If you want to do any of the 5th floor attractions then I suggest you go there first and get your tickets. It was so popular on the day I went that tickets were being sold on a timed basis and the first available time slot was over a hour's wait. I didn't want to wait so cannot comment on if they are worth it or not as I didn't get to try anything.

Wow--we had no idea! The waterfall was amazing and beautiful with the evening light show. It's one of those travel experiences that could go either way (really good or really bad).

It was fun to see locals visiting this new attraction for the first time. They were interspersed with airline travelers pulling their suitcases, who had extra time between connecting flights. It was Friday evening, so quite crowded (although we're used to that being from California).

The mall itself is great. Very wide and spacious walkways and a large selection of restaurants. We had a great pizza at the Pizza Express (and also terrific desserts).

So, to the Jewel.....
We arrived around 6pm, booked into the hotel and then went for a quick walkabout on the top floor around the many restaurants, looking at the HSBC rain vortex, or quite possibly the biggest and most exciting indoor waterfall I have ever seen.

Then downstairs. First to the massive hawker in the basement level and then to the cinema. All done by 11pm and off to bed.

Up and out again by 10am and so to the many shops and restaurants and coffee shops. All interspersed by looking at the vortex from from levels and many angles.

We had to check out of our hotel by noon, so we went straight to early check in. Checked in, collected boarding passes and left our luggage, then went back to the Jewel for another 4 hours.

The planting is amazing. Orchids everywhere.
The canopy walk wasn’t open yet (June 10th) and neither was the netted play area suspended from the ceiling.
Both look very exciting.

Already mentioned the hawker. It’s amazing. And there’s another level of food bars.
There’s a supermarket.

I think Changi has really blown it with the jewel, it has turned a brilliant airport into a version of Disney Land and the poor sods using as an airport are now second to the needs of the good citizens of Singapore intent on a night out.

Incorporating natural elements and designs, walking into the Jewel can be compared to walking into a huge greenhouse, on top of being a grand 10 storey shopping mall.

If you are stopping by Singapore or already in Singapore, a trip down to Jewel would definitely be worth your while. One can easily spend hours walking around and exploring the massive mall which is easily accessible by public transport (CG2 Changi Airport).

You can access Jewel directly from Terminal 1, or cross the linkway from Terminal 2 and 3. Currently, if you are landing in Terminal 4, you have to take a free shuttle bus to Terminal 2 before crossing over.

Early check-in counters are at level one for those who wish to explore the Jewel before leaving; additionally, baggage and luggage can be stowed temporarily in Jewel (Level 1, right beside the check-in counters) at a fee (dependent on luggage sizes).

The 300 retail shops from local and foreign brands are sure to keep you occupied for a few hours. Hence, I recommend not driving into Jewel as their parking fee is comparatively costly ($0.04 per minute for the first 90 minutes and $5.00 for each subsequent half an hour).",04-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 22:45:24.774352

There are number of additional paid attractions you can choose including the canopy bridge which allows you to walk across a glass bridge, and enjoy an amazing view of the entire building. Well worth the money I felt, and staff did not hurry me along - this might have been because it was fairly quiet.

I also opted to pay for entrance to Canopy Park which I felt was worthwhile as it gave me different vantages of the building.

I did not get the opportunity to view the evening light show, but it’s something I am hoping to do on my next visit to Singapore.

It's truly spectacular and a feat that not many other places could pull off. Singapore has created a brilliant addition to the airport that welcomes arrivals home or to the beginning of their trip.

The Jewel is a massive building that is directly connected to Terminal 1 (underground connection) and has 2 walkways to Terminals 2 and 3 respectively. Through these connections it's easy to access through public transport and obviously by aircraft.

For travelers, there are plenty of places to stock up on last minute presents, essential items and brilliant food before heading off! If you are on a long lay-over head to the movie theater, Changi lounge or Yotel (it's a hotel...) to relax or drop off your luggage on Basement 1 so you can explore without dragging your items around.

Obviously the shopping and restaurants are a high on must-dos at this location, but not to forget the center of the attraction: the HSBC waterfall. Right in the center of the dome stands a gigantic waterfall surrounded by lush vegetation on the outer walls. Take the time, visit it, climb the steps and view the waterfall from all angles and heights.

Surprisingly, I arrived at the Jewel, feeling more impressed than ever! The biggest highlight is definitely the HSBC Rain Vortex, which is a waterfall-like fountain that takes up the centre of the complex. It surprising has a calming effect after a while. A SkyTrain that brings passengers from Terminal 3 (T3) to Terminal 2 (T2) and vice versa runs through the complex and beside the fountain. This is only available in the transit area of the airport.

There are many viewing points (all located around the complex) that are all rather good places for photo opportunities, so you do not have to worry if the viewing point that you are at gets crowded.

The complex itself is extremely big and can get confusing at times. Getting from one place to another can be a bit of a hassle. Some escalators skip levels, so you might want to check prior to going around. The levels in Jewel does not coincide with the rest of the terminals.

It would be best if you have at least 3 hours minimum to cover the basics of the complex. If you are having a transit in Singapore, you would need to buffer at least 5-6 hours in total just in case.

There are plenty of dining and shopping opportunities. Price-wise, it may not be the best for budget-conscious travellers. Your best option might be Five Spices Food Court, which gives a somewhat decent variety of local food and food around the region Sadly even then, it is very pricey. The food court is definitely catered to tourists, as menus are made slightly easier for ordering, however wording did get lost in translation and, thus, loses its 'authenticity'.

There are many shops and even the jaded shopper will not get bored. There are also other faciltiies, like Yotel (a transit hotel) and a massage parlour within the complex. Although, there are bars up at level 5, including the local Tiger Street Lab, serving Tiger draft beer and seasonal beers (only 5pm onwards, though). You might want to check prior to visiting, as not all bars have the licence to sell alcohol after 12 midnight (even if they open until 3am, as per contracted with Jewel management; the irony).

Level 5 is home to the Canopy Park and is chargeable. Be careful when walking, as the segregation between the park and the bars/restaurants at level 5 are not very clear.

*Avoid* A&W, Shake Shack and Burger & Lobster unless you are okay with queuing at least 30 mins for food.

You can enter the complex via all terminals except Terminal 4, however the easiest way is via Terminal 1, as it is directly connected. There are link bridges from Terminal 2 and 3, with Terminal 2 having the longest link bridge out of the 2!

As promised to my kids, I queued up in Shake Shack for the world famous burgers from America. Just managed to join the queue at the closing cut off time of 9.15 pm to grab some of their signature hamburgers for taking away.

Another feather on Changi airport's cap, being voted one of the best airports in the world. They have upped the game with the new attraction that cost a cool SGD 1.3 billion to build...",04-2019,Solo,2020-01-29 22:46:56.939766

Anyway, the jewel is a shopping mall suited for both locals for an experience as well as tourists for their last minute shopping and have a quick bite or drink. The main attraction is of course the waterfall (and the hourly light shows) in the rainforest setting. I would suggest that a tourist visits the jewel before check-in so that the shopped items could be included within the checked in baggage.

It looks so amazing in person how the water falls from the roof. You will be mesmerised by it. Around this water features there are lots of green plants and trees which is really nice. I love the whole feel and environment.

At the TOP of the mall there are some activities that you can do like the slides, mazes, walking on the nets but all these extra activities you need to pay separately.

This place is at Changi Airport itself so when you are arriving just walk over to check out the water feature. The mall itself apart from the water feature is just a regular shopping mall with the usual shops and restaurants etc. Nothing to shout about. The main attraction toon is the jewel or the water feature itself.

Recent statistics, however, showed that 90% of the visitors to this attraction are Singaporeans. I am one of them who came here with my residents on two occasions.

On the first visit, I accompanied a group of needy wheel-bound elderlies to see this new creation. At that time, the new Canopy Park has not opened. This time, I led another group of senior citizens from my constituency to visit this new attraction. The Canopy Park has now opened.

While Singapore is small, it is always evolving. always reinventing herself to come up with unique, creative and appealing places of interest to attract both the foreign tourists as well as our locals. If you look at the list of attractions and restaurants and eateries in TripAdvisor, you will see how enterprising a country Singapore is and how the list of attractions outnumber so many countries despite her geographical limitation. And now this attraction boasts of the tallest 40m high artificial waterfall in the world within the no 1 airport in the world. The Shiseido Forest Valley is a lush green sanctuary just outside the Arrival Terminal of the airport. It showcases Singapore as a clean and green city.

Singaporeans love eating and when a world famous F&B chain open their eatery in Singapore, all the Singaporean food reviewers and `gluttons' will flock over here wanting to be the first to taste it. Shake Shack and Burger & Lobster unveil their first new outlet in Singapore and no other places but right at this Changi Jewel. You imagine the number of food lovers at Jewel since the opening.

From the faces and their outfit, Singaporeans seem to be the majority of the long queue of customers at Shake Shack, all yearning to have a taste of the new flavor burgers. Likewise, the locals seem to occupy most of the seats enjoying the sumptuous feast of lobsters at Singapore first exclusive Burger & Lobster outlet at the top floor of Jewel.

The average Singaporeans like me may be contended with the food at the B2 Food Court and the Staff Canteen. One of my residents ordered the burger at Shake Shack and it cost her about $30/-plus for the meal. The lobster feast probably cost more. The food price at the staff canteen or B2 food court may cost half of that price.

The admission fee into Canopy Park is $4.50 for senior like me and it includes the Discovery Slides, the Foggy Bowls, the Petal Garden and the Topiary Walk. The Hedge Maza, the Mirror Maze, the Changi Experience Studio and the Manulife Sky Nets cost slightly more and some include the admission to the Canopy Park.

Attached to the Changi airport, Jewel first catches your attention by its facade, resembling a cut polished jewel. Inside the central water-fall feature is spectacular. Highest indoor water fall as we were told, it's serene yet imposing. We found ourselves approaching that fall from various vantage points and floors. There are similar water features in Gardens by the Bay and in MBS Shoppes, but this one took the cake.

Jewel was so recommended to us by locals and travelers alike that we arrived 5 hours before our flight. Singapore Air was happy to take our luggage off us and we had plenty of time left for the mall. They can check you in upto 24 hours before your departure, another feather in the cap of this wonderfully run airport. Jewel can be accessed from all terminals by a network of Travelators and bridges. It was about a 10 min walk from our Terminal 4.

In terms of shopping it had every brand spread on its 5 levels above ground and 5 basements. The lower and higher levels are geared more towards food with most of the shopping on L1, L2, L3 and B1. We ate at Burger King and Subway before taking off.

The Jewel’s centerpiece and star attraction is the Rain Vortex, which appears to fall from the sky in the middle of The shopping mall. The world's tallest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex can be heard before it is seen but when you do suddenly come across it cascading from 40m, it is a dramatic sight that you can’t stop Instagramming!

It is surrounded by lush gardens of thousands of trees and flowers and features a lovely meditation space at the bottom.

The rest of the shopping mall — that happens to link the various terminals, is full of fantastic stores, quirky boutiques as well as luxury brands, and all sorts of foodie delights that range from fast food to haute cuisine.

We spent a good three hours there before our flight and could easily have stayed longer. It is massive but well signposted and there are shuttles to take you to and from your terminal.

Its claim to fame is the world's largest indoor waterfall, with multimedia shows centred on the cascading water held every night at hourly intervals ftom 7.30pm through 13.30am.

There are plenty of airside attractions within the airside areas of Changi Airport's four terminals catering to transit travellers. However, transit travellers using Changi Terminal 1 with a layover of at least 3.5 hours may wish to check out the huge waterfall right in the middle of Jewel Mall i.e. 2.5 hours for a pitstop and returning to the Airport airside about 45 minutes to an hour before the outbound flight ETD.

Besides viewing the indoor waterfall, travellers may pick up some Made in Singapore products and food gifts, and perhaps grab a quick bite or some refreshments before the next flight. Changi Airport souvenirs and the world's first Pokemon Concept Store outside Japan are on Level 4 of Jewel Mall, while Level 1 hosts many of the Singapore food gift shops, i.e. bbq pork jerky (from 'Bee Cheng Hiang'), pre mixed spices and seasoning for popular local dishes like chicken rice, chilli crab etc. (from 'Taste Singapore'), local swiss rolls with coconut jam (from 'Rich & Good Cake Shop') and artisanal cookies with tropical herbs and other ingredients (from 'Cookie Museum'), etc.

Travellers leaving Singapore on red eye flights out of Terminal 1 may take a taxi to Jewel instead of the terminal building, for early check in on Level 1, followed by dinner at one of the mind boggling variety of F&B outlets spread across B1, B2 and Levels 1 through 5. Private hire vehicles may drop off passengers on Level 2; travellers should use the downward escalator near 'Shake Shack' fast food restaurant to reach the early bird check in counters on Level 1.

Travellers using the other Terminals 2,3,4 who wish to visit Jewel should may use sheltered, overhead link bridges. Personally I won't bother to detour to Jewel as there are enough shops and facilities in the airside areas to keep anyone occupied till ETD.",05-2019,Friends,2020-01-29 22:49:07.118387

What makes it different is the giant spectacular water feature and forest right at the center of everything. The rain vortex is indeed impressive and completely changes from day to night and from the top to the bottom levels and the forest around it is nice too.
In my opinion they could turn down the hideous 'movie soundtrack' music, get rid of the loud percussion band and dull cartoons and try to make it a little more natural and interesting - but I guess that might distract people from spending money......

But Jewel is essential for Changi Airport to raise claim as a regional transport hub, particularly for those transiting via Terminal 4, which is isolated far apart from the other 3 connected main terminals, and has limited facilities.
For a start, Jewel caters a range of facilities that offer passengers a good way to spend the night, especially for those on early morning flights, including some 24 hours restaurants, paid lounge services and hourly accommodation, as well as for those who wants to get to the airport earlier to beat the rush hour traffic. Travellers can also check-in their luggages earlier (for selected airlines, and minimum 3 hours before flight) here, and then go on for a hearty meal or some last minutes shopping, where they can get some real authentic Singapore souvenir (food of course!) and many things else, before proceeding to their respective terminals for boarding. Having said that, Jewel is also a mega shopping mall by the day, with many paid entertainment ideas, including cinema and theme park, which are even considered unique for Singaporeans.
Although the 3 main terminals offer very good facilities for transiting passengers, but Jewel is an excellent complement pre-check-in.
Jewel is directly connected to Terminal 1. But there are also sheltered linked bridge from Terminal 2 and 3 with travelators (given a choice, I'd recommend avoiding the Terminal 3 route as it involves gentle slope), in addition, the sign boards can be a little hard to spot.

For locals, the draw is new-to-Singapore brands like Shake Shack, Pokémon Center and Burger & Lobster, as well as returning brands like A&W. I also liked that I could earn both Changi Rewards points and CapitaStar$ at the same time.

An important point to note is that Jewel is not in the transit (restricted) area. It is located before departure immigration so it is open to everyone, not just those who are travelling.

Also, another important thing to note is that Jewel is first and foremost a shopping mall. So for travellers, I would suggest that you leave your heavy luggage in the mall’s left luggage facility, or come by on your departure day and do an early check-in and bag drop at the mall itself.

This is because it will be very crowded, even after the initial hype will have died down, as there will be many local residents patronising Jewel as well. Changi Airport is different from airports in many cities because 1) Singapore is small so the airport is just a 20-min drive away to the city center & 2) it is highly accessible by regular public transport.

There are many casual eateries, including a food court, as well as a cinema and supermarket in Jewel (all at regular city prices and not the typical inflated airport price), so this essentially means it also serves as a neighbourhood mall for locals living in the East and North-East regions of Singapore, as well as a lunch-time/after work spot for those working in the airport area or Changi Business Park.",04-2019,Friends,2020-01-29 22:49:32.245485

,1,14,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/motiver2018,665464244,11-04-2019,5,A place not to be missed!,"First hand experience - Visited this place in its first day preview before it opens to the public on April 17. A pre-registered ticket got us through to this new escapade in Singapore. It is located in the centre of the three airport terminals and very easy to access from either of the terminals. The place is free to enter, just like another shopping complex. With about 300 shops and eateries, we are spoilt for choices. There are mid to high end retail outlets but we could also find the local supermarket - Fairprice Finest there. Being the first day of preview, it was rather crowded. We go for the top most level first where you could walked among trees and plants and be rewarded from the top view of the key highlight - the HSBC Rain vortex. It rain water and emit a mist too, at intervals. There was the skytrain that also passes through the jewel but I guess that is for transit passengers. There are several attractions not open yet; it will be in June where children will find joy in climbing the sky nets and bouncing up and down. There will be a Hedge maze and a mirror maze, etc.. so we will target to go again in June. The whole place is air-conditioned and very pleasant to stroll, albeit the crowds. There's so much to enjoy relaxing among the trees while those who likes shopping and eating will be spoilt for choices. As we went during the day preview, we understand the night time is a different experiences as there will be more lights. Must go and experience yourself as there's so much to write for now. They have a website - just google. It is a place to spent a few hours whether you are inbound or outbound.",04-2019,Friends,2020-01-29 22:49:42.813320
