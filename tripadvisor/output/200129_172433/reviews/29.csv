As only limited number of people can go on the skyway at a time you get a queuing slot along with the ticket. On the skyway the coordinators keep asking you to move forward as the bridge needs to be empty before next group of people come in.

The views from the Skyway are breath taking. Seeing it in pictures is nothing compared to the real experience. The skyway does sway a little so perhaps if you are afraid of heights this might not be for you. However, the feeling you get from just standing on it is worthwhile!

During the night, when it is busy, time spent on it can be limited to 15 minutes. This is not enforced though. When it is not busy, you can spend as much time as you want and take in the experience and feeling that comes with standing on top of such a magical structure while you marvel at the trees.

The tickets can be purchased just beside the skyway and are not expensive.

If you come to Singapore and you do not go on the Skyway, I mean, were you even in Singapore?",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:40:22.964164

For an Extra $8, you can take an elevator to go up the skyway and get a birds eye view of the super tree grove as well as the surroundings.

The Skyway serves two purposes - get a closer view of the super trees and the surroundings and for many people - most importantly provide multiple photo opportunities.

Tip: Queue up at the ticketing kiost around 7:15pm and get on top by about 7:40pm to enjoy the light show from the top of the bridge. Note that the number of people on top is limited, so depending on the number of people, the queuing time differs",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:40:33.066141

OCBC Skyway is a real highlight of any visit to the Gardens by the Bay, but you should aim to visit when it is dark and the artificial trees are lit up with some wonderful lights.
Also try and catch the evening Light and Music show either before you go up or when you are on the Skywalk itself.
The queue to get up to the walk itself is pretty busy, but it does move along.
There are signs that say they try to limit people on the skywalk itself to a maximum of 15 minutes, but I am not sure how they manage to usher people out as there seems to be a continual stream of people visiting the walk, I suspect you can stretch the time on the walk to more than 15 minutes - but 15 minutes is probably enough time to catch the views and any photo opportunities anyway, it is not a long walk.
I found the walk more enjoyable than both Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome.
Do yourself a favour, take a trip up to the Skywalk, it takes less time than visiting the domes.",07-2018,Family,2020-01-30 05:41:00.676568

You can enjoy a panaromic view of the city lush greenery in the day, and when dusk approach, the captivating Marina Bay skyline gets lighted up and the entire area comes alive during the Garden Rhapsody light and sound show (twice daily).

These futuristic giant trees transport you high up on the air ad you can enjoy an aerial walk which approx 128m long, stopping at various points to take pictures of the bay and lush park beneath. While the view from the top is remarkable, it is even more so when on the ground! That's when you can see how high and majestic these SuperTrees are. It gives you a sense of perspective and you felt that you are transported to a futuristic land, where dinosaurs are expected to appear at any one time!

Note: Photographers: Super wide angles, and tripod, for the fascinating twilight view when the trees lights up and the sky colors deepens in hues of red, orange, purple and pink. You can buy tickets at the foot of the Supertrees itself and entrance is via a elevator just behind the stand. Else, you can make reservations or purchase the tickets together when entering the Gardens by the Bay.

You could literally walk at one end to the other in a few minutes. Of course we lingered, admired the views, took photos etc - still, we didn't feel it was of great value.

As it was cloudy when we visited, we were informed that if it rained, we would be asked to come down from the walkway for safety reasons. However, as your tickets are ""one use only"", you would not be allowed back up. Whilst we can appreciate the safety considerations, not sure if that ticketing policy is reasonable. Staff describing the policy were not very sympathetic.

Further, there was a Christmas Fair when we visited. The Fair was in the same grounds as the supertrees where the walkway is located. In order to access the walkway, you were required to pay for Fair tickets first (even if you only wanted to visit the walkway). Signage was poor - only found this out after some fruitless walking around and asking staff. Fair tickets were not available at the door - you had to go to a ticket booth a good 10-15 minutes walk away (with no guarantee of tickets), buy the tickets online (difficult as a tourist with no internet access), or come again before 3pm (before the Fair opens).

Considering all three are pricey, it was a great idea to get the discounted tickets.
We arrived around noon, and we were worried that it'd be really hot on the skyway, but it turned out that it was the opposite and there was a cool breeze along with spectacular views. Because they only let a few people at a time onto the Skyway, it wasn't crowded at all, we could get all the photos we wanted, and the great views weren't obstructed at all.
Later in the evening, the lineups for the skyway get REALLY long, and everyone wants to be on the skyway for the evening light show so the best time to go is in the morning or afternoon when you can walk straight on to the elevator.

If you are using the MRT subway BAYFRONT station. which is on the CIRLE LINE. From the MRT there is a 5-7 minute walk to the attraction. Most of this is undercover with AC.

To do the whole site (lakes/gardens/skywalk/domes) and enjoy this would take at least 1/2 a day to complete. Especially if you have children with you.

Once you reach Gardens by the Bay, the main lakes, outside gardens and communal areas are free entry however the Skyway charges S$8 per adult and S$5 per child (3-12yrs). The Skyway is accessed from the ground level by a lift for entry and exit.

They do restrict access to the Skywalk if there is heavy rain or thunderstorms or if they are extremely busy. You get a great view of the Gardens, Dome and Singapore Skyline from the walkway‚Ä¶ Great opportunities to take a few selfies so forget the camera.

Would strongly recommend taking water with you however, if you forget there are a few outlets selling water, ice creams etc‚Ä¶ priced reasonably.

If you are at the attractions in the evening or want to return there they do a nightly light show at 19;45 / 20:45.

The cost is SGD$8 which is quite reasonable (in my opinion) as Singapore is not really a cheap place but in terms of value for money, this might not be the highest rated attraction as it is literally a walkway between two supertrees. The walkway narrows as you walk towards the middle and then broadens out. The ""sides"" of the walkway come up to waist height so there may be a concern in terms of safety for younger children or those who are taller and have a higher center of gravity. There is a lift that takes you up and another lift (at the other end of the walkway) which takes you down - there are also stairs.
The views which is the raison d'etre for this attraction are not mindblowing. They are very good and I would recommend this attraction most definitely, but don't expect to see much more than the Gardens. The view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel is slap bang in your face and the flyer is over to one side, but this is really as much as was viewable. I went up during the afternoon and so may be the real attraction is in the evening the lights in the Super Tree Grove are twinkling.

There is a separate cost for this, currently $8SD for adults. You take the elevator up in the center of one of the trees then walk on the Skyway taking as many photos as you can and then take another elevator down a different Tree.

From the Skyway, you can see the entire Marina Bay and you will have killer views of the iconic Marina Bay Sands property, as well as the domes and gardens of Gardens by the Bay. Plus you can see all the other trees in the Super Tree Grove up close and personal.

The Skyway has room for a few people across for most of it, but gets thinner in the middle portion. It is not solid and has a little sway to it, I wanted to mention that in case you might be slightly afraid of heights, still worth checking out, completely safe too. Great great photo ops everywhere. Lots of people but they kind of regulate the number of people there is seems. They post only 15 minutes max viewing time, but there is no-one there checking this out at all.

I loved seeing this walkway, it, to me, is part of the very coolest part of a very cool park/Garden which only makes it a bigger smash. Seeing the Trees and Grove is free, the walkway has a little expense, but is so well worth it.

Don't miss it, make sure your phone/camera has lots of battery life left as you will be taking lots of photos for sure.

The views of thec waterfront and bay are fantastic too.
But most of all you get a great view of the Supertrees themselves and the beautiful flowers and shrubs in the vertical gardens.
It is such a unique place and fshrytale-like in its magical otherworldliness.
No steps by the way, it's a lift up and down. The skyway is not very long and the staff tell you that you have a maximum of 15 minhtes up thete, but try to drag your feet and stay up a bit longer!",07-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:19.425968

Note that the walk may take 15-20 mins since you need to save time for other visitors behind you. Amazing night view!!!,03-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:19.782413
,1,29,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Erica P,470452975,27-03-2017,4,Exciting Walkway,The walk amongst the top of the Supertrees is worthwhile. Even though you only have 15mins there are plenty of photo opportunities and the view over the park and the skyline is amazing. The Skyway is open between 9.00am and 9.00pm daily so if you want to get that evening view you can certainly do so.,03-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:20.159247

We were content by just taking pictures below. But spur of the moment decision we bought a ticket. And we were not disappointed. One of our best purchases for SG$8!

The view is way more spectacular than what you see below. And our pictures look more Instagram-worthy!",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:20.826133

Arrived at 7.30pm. The park around the Skyway and Supertree were filled with people. Everyone anxiously awaiting the nightly lights show at 7.45pm. The show is about 15 minutes. Different song theme each night. The songs played are hot favourites of different time, really turned back the clock to this days. The light shows run by the song. Really interesting.

Enjoyed the short display. Worth thinking and remembering.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:21.926409

For those suffering height issues it might not be suitable for them. The walk is well enclosed so safety is not an issue. It was a very pleasant stroll along the walk and to take in the sights of Singapore from a different perspective. I found the whole experience enjoyable and peaceful. It is an attraction I would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore.,08-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:45:27.713503
