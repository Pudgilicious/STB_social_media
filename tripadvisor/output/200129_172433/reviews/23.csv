Haji Lane is kind of cute place to visit with some interesting stores and food places with lots of people taking selfies. We almost stopped at a restaurant called the Mad Sailors British Kitchen, but found it to be a bit grotty and when we went inside and sat down to look at the menu we were told that all the tables inside were reserved and that we'd either have to sit outside in the heat or sit at the bar by the window which we thought not too appropriate since we had young children with us. Since nobody else was sitting inside the place and the prices on the menu seemed a bit expensive, we decided to skip eating here.

Further down this small street were a couple of other eat places and shops selling this and that and we quickly arrived at the end of this street without finding much of interest. There was actually a place called Miao Cat Cafe just around the corner but it didn't look too interesting and was quite small inside so we skipped that too and moved on to Arab Street and other more interesting areas nearby.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 04:05:13.428620

There are so many quaint shops to browse and buy from. Their wares are not the stuff you find in shops or departmental stores, but certainly you will find more than one souvenir to bring back with you, Its also another photogenic location, apart from Joo Chiat's peranakan houses.

Recommend to go to Haji Lane on weekdays when it’s less crowded and to check the weather ahead of time. Haji Lane is mostly unsheltered hence it will be pretty hot outside. However, the shops are mostly air-conditioned which is a good respite from Singapore’s heat.

Many of the shops have narrow corridors and steep stairs hence may not be suitable for some. Though the main walkway is generally clear for ease of access, except for the small alleys.

Problem is I am old and have seen it all before. Selfie coffees and pet cafes? This is culture? Government sanctioned street art? Yoga studios and... what else? I can't think of it now, but I'm sure you can.

There is a high business turnover around Haji Lane. I don't just mean the customers coming and going, but the businesses. Is this because the businesses are just trend followers riding the zietgeist, yet never getting ahead of the game? Or because the businesses are pushing risky ideas with the comfort of government subsidised rent?

Perhaps this actually is local culture. Perhaps they are on top of things. How about that? As you walk through you may come to your own conclusion.

Etymological fact: Haji Lane gets its name from the times when Muslim pilgrims of SE Asia would arrive in Singapore to transit for their epic trip to Mecca. Singapore being a free port made it the obvious choice for travellers, hence creating a huge market for Islamic provisions (and accommodation) that were found in the shophouses which now sell faux art pictures of seemingly unrelated quotes and western celebrities.",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 04:11:40.413017

Its significance is that it is from here that devote Muslims set off on their journey to Mecca - the Haj.

We had just visited the Sultan Mosque nearby, and while we were allowed into the grounds of the mosque we could not go inside because everyone was busy in purification rites and prayers for their imminent Haj.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:12:00.108192

When i came to SG the first time in 2012 i did some research on blogs where you can find small boutiques to buy special gifts etc and stumbled upon Haji Lane where also those bloggers often have tiny shops selling their items. Surrounded with also great restaurants, this place I think is an Oasis in often so big and mall overcrowded Singapore. I absolutely can recommend Piedra Negra if you wanna munch down some really authentic Guacamole (rest of the menu is not so great) and for chilling outside on a warm evening Blue Jazz Cafe! Around there is even a cat cafe (yes, you go there and can pet some kitties while having a cuppa) and around Arab street there are great places to go for Falafel/Middle Eastern food.

The area is still focused on the Sultan Mosque.

The shops on Haji Lane are a mix of boutiques, some fabric shops, and some specialty stores.

Restaurants in the area are a mixed bag. If you're in the mood for some decent Turkish food try Derwish one street over on Bussorah St.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 04:12:09.137607
