The track is tight and slower than most tracks. Vettel won but LeClerc was the better driver. Bad management by Ferrari put Vettel ahead.

What’ a party. Gwen Stefani. Red Hot Chili Peppers. Fat Boy Slim. Some of the twenty music acts. Restaurants bars and shopping. Singapore has it all and puts it all on for F1.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-30 06:42:19.228552

We went on the Singapore Flyer and had noticed the track. In one the of shops in the complex is an electric scooter hire place. For $30.00 you can hire these for approx half an hour and go around a small part of track. Mainly the straight and grid but also part of the stand and road.They are already staring to work to get it up and ready for September but were more then happy for us to zoom up and down the road. We were pretty much left alone (except for when we got onto the road!) but had so much fun.. would highly recommend doing something like this.. so different form your normal things to do in Singapore and again ..

The track is said to be on par with the big ones and it didn't disappoint as a night race it adds the experience we got to see drivers close ,up we got disappointed hamilton was going to come probably 5th we got exited it went to pot and the race changed or transformed the experience the crowd was electric cheering alive its hard to describe the orange army for vestapen cheering and adding to experience until he crashed . so this is a unmissable item the big wheel was free the entertainment is imense the acts cost a bomb to see are all free , if you get a pit walk take it , sum that up as unforgettable. this is a short one or I write pages because I loved it so much , buy your ticket early research the best seats and you will love it if your budgets small go for walk round access loads good places to stand not busy but dont miss the end track access to podium you need rite gate to get in also the drivers walk in at gate at certain times to get autographs or pictures , so Hello Singapore F1 2018 ,",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 06:42:21.402170
,1,34,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/kaney68,526888332,24-09-2017,5,Great Bang For Your Buck !,"Only the second time attending the Singapore F1 night race and once again loved it.
Personally I feel the event caters for 3 sets of people.
Those that love their F1, those that want to attend the concerts and those like myself that are there for both.
While I would like to experience what zone 1 and 2 offer, I find it hard to justify the expense.
As in my previous attendance, I booked the 3 day Bay Grand Stand seats, as I feel this offers the best value for money.
You are guaranteed a seat, 2 large screens are directly opposite the stand, a superb view of Marina Bay, large undercroft area under the stand with food and drink outlets plus more large screens.....also great in the event of rain !
With this ticket you can still roam the walkabout areas in zones 3 and 4, which offer some good vantage points !

One thing that stands out with the Singapore event is the ease in which you access the track and also exiting....
Queues are minimal.
The SMRT put on extra trains post event to move people swiftly.
Or you can quite possibly just walk back to your hotel....many hotels will be accessible in a 15-20 minute walk.

Looking forward to attending a few more night races in Singapore, now it has been extended for a further 4 years :-)",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 06:42:21.769925

It was a wet start and Ferarri crashes out giving Hamilton and Mercedes the window and title.
Ground too wet to stay around.
Probably my last.

,1,34,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/al22tecc,424007529,01-10-2016,5,the most complete formula 1 race,"As compared with other formula 1 races/venues, this one is THE complete package. I find those reviews that gave poor or average reviews as queer because they feel its not worth it for different reasons. If you are an F1 enthusiast, or concerts, or just looking for a weekend that feels like a party each and every night, this place is for you. So to these critics, STOP complaining! To each to his own and this night race weekend provides that. There are other F1 races whose vantage points are superior to those in singapore f1. If so, go to those places as Sing F1 is obviously not for you. Mind you, this is a night race as other races are done during the day so if you want to stay under the sun, go to other races. A night race in my opinion provides a more pleasant experience.

For the complete package, an entrance fee allows the patron multiple choices of watching the race, several concerts, several booths of multitudes of activities. and if you like ferraris or porsches they also have their own race at late afternoons. By the way, this is the only F1 race that includes not just 1 concert, but at least 1 main concert every night for 3 nights. For this year's, we are talking of several. I was able to watch 4 out of the 6 either at Padang or at the Esplanade outdoor Theatre. The ultimate concert experience with Queen and Adam Lambert, and an exciting race with a close finish between Rosberg and Ricciardo. Yeah, you can watch it on TV. But its just the same as watching a live ppv boxing match: its different watching it on TV versus watching it live even if the protagonists are matchbox sizes. The noise of the formula 1 cars zooming, the rumble, the cheering of the different loyalists, you can't feel that on TV.

Expensive food and drinks but then again, such is the case when going to places like universal studios. regardless of the price of a cup of beer at $10, beer galore.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 06:42:29.112341
,1,34,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Susan B,423417079,29-09-2016,5,First F1 Experience - won't be the last!!! Wow!,"We organised our 8 day trip to Singapore, and later found out the Grand Prix was on when we were due to arrive on the 2nd Race day. We were at the Grand Prix within 2.5hours of landing in Singapore.

Arriving there in the dark and in a hurry, it took a while to get our bearings. We missed most of the Pentatonix concert cause we got lost several times.

Once we got ourselves sorted - it was Wow Wow and more Wow.

We had tickets in the Bay Grandstand - I'm glad I had seats and not the walkabout tickets, as the heat etc, it was just nice to sit and watch the race or the big screen we had infront of us. When we go again, our kids will be much older - so we will spend more money on better seats for the two of us.

The concerts were fantastic. It was ashame Pentatonix was moved on the Saturday night, the stage for them was too small with such a large crowd wanting to see them.

Queen was amazing with Adam Lambert, Hasley was brilliant. I took my teenage daughter to the Padang stage to see her - and I am a fan now.

The food choices were excellent in some spots. Much better than others.

The F1 was definitely the highlight of our 8 days in Singapore. We will be back. Never been to an F1 before, only V8's - but we loved it. A fantastic atmosphere.

The even is extremely well run. Things don't run as well where I'm from - they were great.

My only issue would be water, you need to drink a lot of it and it can get expensive. The music on Stages 4 are incredible with an awesome line up. Trip Advisor would let me choose September 2015, which is when we went, but we are going again in 2016 and I know Singapore won't disappoint.

The best corner (turn 7) and fastest place on the circuit does even have audience access to view. I wanted to take my son to see an F1 race but at $1200 for the both of us, to bunch up with other non-seaters and crane our necks to see the cars whiz by, simply isn't worth the outlay. The grandstand layout is also poor, in that the stands all view the straights, where nothing happens in an F1 race (you need to see corners) . The track itself is tight and bumpy with little passing opportunities and the current rules and cars make for very boring racing. Last years 1,2,3 start 1,2,3 on the grid By comparison a ticket at Daytona for my son is $20.",09-2015,Family,2020-01-30 06:42:30.862996

We prefer walkabout tickets with my child, exploring the various corners. Stand near to the fence to feel the rush and adrenaline. In my opinion, Grandstand (static) seats are less exciting.

The Ushers had to be the most helpful and friendly people in the country, they couldn't do enough for us.

Wish the screen had showed times and who had changed tyres. Watched qualifiers and race and my biggest complaint was certain members of the crowd who continually walked in front of those of us seated, or stood in the aisles filming and blocking the view.
Why, if you have paid all that money can’t you just sit your backside down and watch the race??? Do you really need to keep topping up on beer and chips? Why run around filming when you can watch / record the whole race on TV later. Can’t you sit still for two hours? It’s so unfair on those of us who have come to be fully immersed in the race and on the young security staff who were trying their best and being pushed aside.
At the end there was a feeling of being ‘held’ before the gates opened and a drunk behind us nearly started a fall forward which would have been fatal. Too much alcohol, too many idiots.

This is an amazing experience, with excellent seating, good video coverage, and supporting motor race functions. The venue is extremely well laid out, and access via MTR is painless.

We booked seats at turn 3 premier, and were about 50 ft off the track between turns 2 and 3. A great position, with extremely good visibility of the track, and a large screen directly in front of the stand for viewing. You need ear protection because you are so close to the track - preferable ear defenders with an FM radio, so ou can listen to the race commentary. Good supporting races from the Ferrari and Porsche racing teams. The stands are not shaded, so a hat is necessary if the sun is out.

We purchased the F&B package, which gives you 6 drinks per day, snacks, and food - dinner, since it’s a night race. There a water station next to the Gate1 entry, 3 minutes from turn 3, so fill your water bottles there rather than using drinks tickets. Beer is served in a cup, about 10 oz. Wine and Prosecco are in thimbles - maybe one third to half a normal measure. Snacks were disappointing - at best, but the dinner from the Indian grill was extremely good.

Entertainment was excellent in terms of choice, but if you wanted to attend any of the major performances (red hot chilli peppers for instance) you would have a LONG walk to the stage at the other end of the 5m track.

Spectacular fireworks display at the end of the race.

The only night race with a superb line up of entertainment. It’s more than a car race and something you should do if you can make the necessary logistics and the budget.

Turn 1/2 are the best for viewing.

We could almost touch the drivers and see all the build up to the race. There was a huge firework show at the end of the race.

We found the food and drinks prices reasonable but be prepare to queue, especially on the Sunday.

My top tip is wear comfy shoes and loose clothing, there is a lot of walking btw grandstand ect and it gets very hot. Also take an empty water bottle, as there are free filling stations around the circuit.

We arrived in Singapore on Thursday do had a day to acclimatise and find our feet. We made our way to the circuit Friday to watch the practice and soak up the atmosphere. We found our seats and had the most spectacular view over the bay. Luckily it’s a night race so your views change as the sun sets. We watched practice from bay grandstand (Fri), qualifying from Stanford (Sat) and the race from the pit straight (sun). I’d highly recommend trying a combination to get a feel for the race.

The whole circuit is spectacular and the staff work extremely hard, it’s amazing to hear that the ushers are all volunteers. Singapore should be very proud of their teenagers who take time out to support this yearly event.

Food n drink is similarly priced to the bars/ restaurants in some areas of Singapore so you don’t feel like your over paying once your in. (Apart from the ice creams $6 was pricy) They are plenty of things to do once your in the venue. Entertainment and pop up stands are spread out but be prepared to walk lots as the entrance and stands are some walk away.

Race night is filled with lots of atmosphere and the headline acts play pre-race. However you miss it if your not seated near the stage as you’d not see the pre race schedule if you watched the acts.

We were lucky enough to get a guided tour of the Parc Ferme Saturday night which allowed us to get a sneaky peak of the behind the scenes of F1. We got to meet a few of the drivers too who hung around with their crews. Total dedication to their team given the day ahead they had.",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 06:43:23.439990

Great entertainment throughout the weekend with some huge acts, this year The Killers were sensational.
Wear comfortable shoes, lots of walking required and be prepared for huge crowds.
Set right in the heart of a Singapore city, so a dramatic skyline, with amazing firework display right after the race! After the race, recommend a meal and few drinks at Boat Quay.

We were instructed to collect them from Raffles City Convention Centre which was a short walk from our hotel (Marina Mandarin) or in easy reach of City Hall MRT station, it is accessed from Raffles City Mall. We collected the tickets on Thursday and there was only a short queue.
Entrance to the circuit on Friday for Practice sessions was easy. We were told to get the MRT there but it was actually quicker to walk and we could mainly go through Malls which were air conditioned - a blessing as it is very humid indeed. We were told to get MRT from Esplanade to Nicoll Highway to Gate 1 as we were in Turn 1 Grandstand but we walked through Marina Mall and Suntec to Gate 2 and followed the signs/crowds from there. There wasn't a very big queue to get in and security was reassuringly tight with bag searches and metal detectors, security staff were friendly and welcoming.
You aren't allowed to take food in and can only take a small bottle of water in with you. You are allowed a normal camera but not supposed to take large professional cameras which is understandable as they would block the view of those around you.
The seating is typical of major events with uncomfortable seats and not much room so you really get to know your neighbours!! Volunteers and visible numbering made finding seats really easy.
Turn 1 Grandstand had a good view of the end of the start/finish straight and then turns 1 and 2 as well as the pit exit. there were 2 large screens opposite us. We were in Section A4 Row 4 which only had one row in front of us as the Marshalls area was in front of that.
We were near to the smaller Village Stage which had some of the acts on - we saw Duran Duran and Seal but the main Padang Stage was a long walk away and although we had hoped to get to see Calvin Harris there after the race on Sunday by the time we had watched the celebrations and got lost about half way there we decided not too. There wasn't enough signage between the 2 ends of the circuit.
There were food stalls but the queues were long - especially on Sunday and the food offering wasn't great particularly for veggies, its worth getting a few bottles of water early on when you go in before the queues get too big as you need to drink plenty in the humidity.
The atmosphere in the Grandstand was good - we got a lot of stick during qualifying from all the Australian Fans surrounding us when Hamilton only managed 5th! We prayed for rain and got it at just the right time at the start of the race. This was the first wet race in 10 years - we were luckily under a motorway flyover so stayed dry! We were in an ideal position for the big crash at the beginning of the race and got our own back on our neighbours as Hamilton won!
You can get onto the track for the podium from Turn 1 Grandstand but there was a big rush to get onto track so we just watched on the screen instead.
There are plenty of toilets around and they are all kept clean and stocked with toilet paper and hand towels throughout the weekend.
There were Porsche and Ferrari Challenges for the supporting races which were exciting too.

It is not by any means the cheapest and due to the track being a street circuit there isn't one place that offers brilliant views. But what it lacks in pricing and views it more than makes up for in atmosphere, organisation and off-track activities.

We were at the Bay grand stand which is the cheapest grandstand overlooking the corner before the cars drive underneath the stand. This offers limited view of the cars but a great backdrop of the Marina Bay. We also got access to the free music events each night which included Bastille, Imagine Dragons and Queen.

It really appealed to those in the party who were less interested in the grand prix. Everyone is really friendly and informative and being in the city there is plenty of choices for food and drink. With easy access to the MRT system is makes it very easy to get away from the track after.

Make sure you do as it is hot and humid and prices are expensive on the grounds. The headline ""Queen"" concert was excellent and located on zone 4. If you are a Formula One fan I suppose it would be worth it. If you are just curious don't think it is worth your time and money. Hotels charge a huge increase in price when the Grand Prix is on. Swissotel on Stamford is directly across from gate 3 and an excellent location to stay. You can pay extra and have a room facing the race track.

It was our first ever live GP and we chose Singapore because of its close proximity from Perth, and great weather. We weren't let down. The race was exhilarating!
Ticket collection was a breeze and the seats we were given were great. We sat in Padang on Friday, the Bay Saturday and Pit Straight for the race on Sunday. It was great to get a different perspective.
We absolutely loved watching the race live and having so many screens around with commentary was fantastic. We took radios but never used them. We bought food at the venue, which was pretty typical of food at most venues.
We support Daniel Riccardo and he nearly got there at the end. We really wanted to get on the track after the race to see the presentations, but only 1 gate opened along pit straight. With everyone in the grandstand trying to get through, we didn't make it onto the track until presentations had finished. This was our biggest disappointment. We could see people entering from all other directions, but we thought being so close, we would have been let out first. When we finally got onto the track, we had time for a couple of photos before being ushered off again, and the long walk out.
The only other disappointment was the size of the concert venue at Padang. I believe it was turned in the other direction from previous years. Not sure if this made the space smaller or larger but we could not get in, so had to watch the screens from outside the venue. Really wanted to see Queen, as they are one of our favourite bands. We weren't the only ones, there were 1000's who could not get in. We heard so many people complaining to the security that we were standing next to. Maybe they could increase the size next year.

Our first F1 race and boy what a race to pick
We didn't scrimp on the tickets and got a 3 day turn 1 grandstand ticket around £500 but worth every penny!
Best seat n the house you see turns 1,2 & 3 all the action on the first corner from the start
If your sat by a straight you just see a blur as the cars roar past
Other reviews mention earplugs and the noise we took them but you've just got to get in to the whole atmosphere and hear the sound of the engines
It might sound expensive but where else could you get 3 nights of racing plus 3 superb nights of concerts Kylie Minogue, Bastille, Queen, Imagine Dragons, Pentatonix & KC & the Sunshine Band plus Dynamo and scores of other local acts and entertainers
Few tips:- wear loose clothing it is hot humid and in the crowds at the end invariably uncomfortable wear flip flops take a portable fan
Eat at Singapore Flyer unless you like paying £8 for an un appetising burger or you really like nachos and hot dogs the food at the flyer is local dishes at a fraction of the price

If you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands Do Not go on to the track at the end of the race you can not get back off it and end up having to walk past your exit for the hotel by some considerable way only to then have to walk back all whilst dripping in sweat as it is so hot

The sound of their engines, ripping by you, tires sparking on the pavement, ripping around corners, you can feel the vibration of the engine on the ground, and they go sooo fast its crazy.

Was in Singapore for 2 days, didn't know the grand prix existed here until the cab driver told us. Getting tickets, was easy in thought. I walked over to Raffel City and bought tickets for the walk about in zone 4 as it was the cheapest ticket. However, my recommendation is they need a more organized and efficient way of buying and collecting tickets. As i was the only one in line and still had to wait like 20 min until someone was able to help me.

The race was great, and entry was efficient and quick. With Zone 4 walk about, you can only enter the race at 2:30pm, no earlier. They had mini races and practices going on all day, there is music and food. They could use more stands selling water as it is HOT.

Firstly, the venue. The street track is unbelievably well located around Marina Bay-- it is beautiful, interesting, and takes full advantage of everything the area has to offer. Secondly, getting there is a breeze-- lots of MRT stations service the track, and it couldn't be easier or cheaper getting there anywhere from Singapore. Thirdly, there are lots of existing bars and restaurants you can eat and drink in, plus the special pop ups for the event. The prices are pretty reasonable for a big event-- you don't feel you are getting ripped off. The security and all entry arrangements are as efficient as everything is in Singapore.

Then the races themselves. The night racing is terrific-- the cars gleam under the lights, photography is great, stands are well located, and the track is challenging and interesting. Plenty of big screens keep you up to date with all aspects of the race.

Finally, the entertainment is continuous, accessible, and of high quality. We saw Queen, Bastille and Imagine Dragon perform, and the staging and ease of access was great.

I think you need to like car racing to enjoy this. Otherwise, I'd say there's no reason to go unless you're really curious about the experience. It seems like a lot of foreigners travel here to see this. But once you're there, the cars zip past you as you spend 2-3 seconds appreciating the sight of them. After about 15 minutes, I was bored out of my mind. I don't drink alcohol so that doesn't help me either. The setup of the race is decent. It's neat to see the race in the city. The views as a spectator aren't that great in my opinion. If I had someone visiting me, I would not take them there unless they were really into this sort of thing. I also wouldn't recommend locals go here either. The only thing I hope is that I'll get an aerial view of the race someday.

I was on a basic ticket in the Bay Grandstand. The view wasn’t very good. I felt like I was watching a tennis match. Instead of following the ball from right to left it was the cars passing by. Also, as this is a street track the track is surrounded by high fencing and the track is even lower down so cars following the racing line maybe obscured even further. I appreciate this is for safety but it doesn’t really help for the viewing experience. I did go to the free viewing points at times and you could see the cars and drivers a bit closer but the view is nothing special. These points are better for the driver’s parade though.

The positive side is the atmosphere and the glamorous and stunning area it is set in. It was a buzz to be there and for me great to see my favourite driver LH44 get an amazing pole and dominate and win. But in reality the best place to watch this sport is via TV. In fact most of the time that was all I was doing watching the screens opposite the track!

The zone 3 and 4 my ticket allowed had some good restaurants and bars and there were a few concerts over the three days. As expected souvenirs and programme were quite expensive but you see that at every sporting event. I found the security and staff a mixed bunch. Some were friendly and helpful others just seemed they wanted you to leave the place as soon as the various sessions were over. A bit annoying when I wanted to buy a shirt from a shop after.

At the end of the race I noticed people walking the track but our stand and zone were not allowed. I assume the higher cost areas allowed this. Getting out and to the MRT station wasn’t too bad considering the amount of people.

I loved the setting, loved the atmosphere at times and loved the result but I would not sit in the same area again. But I heard the zone 1 and 2 areas tickets are sold for $1000s. When I win the lotto I’ll come back and enjoy this event in style.",09-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 06:44:35.725010

I have general walkabout tickets, which meant I had excess to Zone 4. This meant I had to watch the track action from the temporary bleacher. Because it's a street circuit you can't really see what's happening apart from the rest of the track, no matter where you are watching the race from, so when booking tickets keep an eye out for the screen so that you can follow the race.
After every day ends there is a international headliner which really makes the race worth it.
One major concern I have had is the main stage, there are very narrow steel gates.
It takes 20 mins or so for the crowd to get out, the risk of stamped is very high, I hope the organizers do something about this.
So in the end, if you are a F1 fan go for the race. (Keep in mind this is a street race) If you are not into F1 and are tagging along with someone, don't worry all the concerts and off stage entertainment and food will keep you happy.

After being involved in the Melbourne Grand Prix for a number of years, I always wanted to experience the the night race and all Singapore has to offer. It didn't fail to disappoint.

I spent the Thursday night walking around the precinct and surprisingly a lot it of it was not locked down and we had good access to many areas which gave us good feel for viewing platforms and locations.

For the price of the Zone Four ticket at $78 , we had great access to the practice sessions and great concerts by KC and the sunshine band and Kylie. As in previous reviews, to get to the main stage and great access you have to get their a little earlier. At the stage they has large screens and it was good chance to rest and enjoy the moment.

I enjoyed watching the qualifying session from the Marina Bay observation deck which gave a great overview of the track and Singapore city. Amazing views and well worth it. They also has screens on the observation deck which helped tracking the sessions.

The event speaks for itself. Great views, sights and the race result never failed to disappoint. Be prepared for the heat and humidity and keep your fluids up. Drinks can be quite expensive but this is not due to the event, just general Singapore pricing. Security at the event was high and I felt safe. Lots of volunteers and clearly a strong volunteering program.

Well done and be back next year no doubt. Any tips - book accomodation early as it gets quite expensive the closer you get to the track.",09-2016,Business,2020-01-30 06:45:18.623759

The grandstands are great places to watch the race, but the real feel of street circuit is being able to do the walkabouts. There are several viewing platforms which tend to get crowded, but great to catch bits and pieces of the action. But you need to catch a spot early!

Anyways, the Singapore GP was the reason why I went back to Singapore for the 2nd time this year. (First was in May with my family) I stayed with a friend who works there so I got away with free accommodations. Speaking of which, make sure to book way in advance to avoid the expensive rates especially during the race weekend. There are also tickets for the next year's race (2019) which you can buy now at a 30% discount. Make sure you familiarize yourself with Singapore's MRT as this will be your best friend going to places where the roads have been closed off due to the street circuit nature of the race. The concerts in the Padang Stadium before the race on Sunday was fun, this year (2018) Dua Lipa performed and it was a blast watching her live. (my daughter may have been jealous had she not switched to k-pop) One thing nice about the GP weekend, the air was festive, people were out in the streets up to the wee hours of the morning after the race, it was off to Clarkey for more drinks and food. And in all that, you never feel like you are in danger strolling the streets of Singapore. (Much safer than in my own country mind you) MRT and bus schedules have been extended to compensate for the influx of tourists to watch the GP (noticed that mostly were Australian? :) Rooting for their mate, Daniel Ricardo.

- Don't bother to pre book tickets. You can get so many last minute deals at throw away prices on gumtree or carousell apps. Also many try to sell off excess inventory at Raffles or City Hall MRT
- Every stand offers its own uniqueness. So chose the stand that's best for your needs speed vs turns vs grandstand etc
- If you are not too keen to watch the after race concerts you can even sell off your tickets at carousell app and recover a part of your investment :)
- If you are not that type to invest 100s of $ to buy a ticket then some places inside Marina Mall emergency exit stairs offer free views and they are quite good spots. Hunt around some places during the qualification days and geo mark them for the race day.
- You can even book some restaurants on the 3nd or 3rd floor that offer the street view to the race. Nothing Beats a beer in hand inside ACed space ;)",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:05.888732

It's so well organised and the transport in and out of the GP is second to none. Forget driving, MTR is the only way to travel.

Beware, at the end of the race the marshalls escort you in one direction which is generally away from the MTR to avoid congestion. Walk towards the pits and away from turn 1 and 2.

Not even a Formula One fan however it was an amazing event. Every day and night there was something to do and I enjoyed every bit of it from the races to concerts, both in the arena and in downtown Singapore. I would suggest it to anyone, fans or not. My only advice is to wear breathable clothing and pack a fan! It's very hot in Singapore !",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:12.540917

Went to the area every afternoon to see the GT race it's so fun. City race makes you so up close to the cars and even we bought tickets with set but still love to just find some standing spot. But the foods and drinks there are super expensive you just need to find a place near zone 3 a street with food booth you can get 8 for beer otherwise it's 12 at the most of the place.,09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:12.915796

What an amazing night view of the marina and buildings. You could hear the cars coming, and the would accelerate then do a massive deceleration into the hard left turn under the stadium. Instructions were clear to gain entry, I lived out east and would catch the 36 bus to Suntec and then walk to the 15mins into the GP areas. These tickets also gave us access to the concerts and were reasonably priced for the 3 days.

I've attended many races and if you like F1, and you're around go for this race. What is different? You're able to be so close to the track, that you can really hear and feel the sound. Next to that, there are fantastic acts and performances after the race to enjoy. ( we had kylie minogue and queen, the real queen indeed). Recommendations: Go for zone 1 or 4. 2 if you really like to be in the singapore flyer, zone 3 is basically the Marina Bay grand stand, which is nice but not the best place to stay. Zone 4 walk about give you options at many places with a good view on the screen to watch the race. So depending on your budget, this is my recommendation. Prices for food and drinks are too high, but this is normal during f1 races. Don't think about it... take it and enjoy!",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:14.368322

We had the premier 3 day walkabout tickets and made good use of them, attending all three days and sampling what the GP has to offer.

Everything was brilliant - easy to get in, get around, helpful staff, well priced food and drink, could get very close to the track - everything.

Also the fact it is a night race with the city overlooking and lit up at night is breathtaking.

A highlight off the track was the opportunity to see Queen and Adam Lambert live after the action on the Saturday. Great show and great crowd singing along.

We purchased tickets early from the official website and set ourselves up in the Bay side grandstand. The tickets were $298 for the three day pass and picked up on arrival at the track from the ticketing booth within the Swissotel hotel at Cityhall MRT.

The whole weekend was amazing with entertainment both on and off track throughout the 3 days, it was the first time I have been to this event and it was definitely world class. The ticketing was exceptional and there are no fears when purchasing online from the official website.

The seating is very good in all stands and the hospitality of the hosts was wonderful. The beer was cold and the food pretty good around the track, there really was no need to leave until closing time. Best of all was Redbull Racings Daniel Riccardo he was exceptional and out drove his cars ability yet again. In the right car this bloke is a world champion!

,1,34,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/siamwanderer,416308296,09-09-2016,3,MONEY MONEY MONEY,"Yes this is a negative review.

I've been to the F1 a few times. This is due to the friendly generosity from friends who benefitted from complimentary tickets, albeit sitting at a grandstand area.
I've had experience watching and experience the race and its surrounds from the Pit Grandstand, Turn 2 Grandstand, Padang Grandstand and walkabout.

To be very honest, it was hard to see who's driving in which car. You will still rely on the many big (mega big) tv screens to tell you what's going on track.
The race is far better to watch on your tv screen at home. At least the camera follow the track action from the leading pack through to the chasing and the pack at the end. Crashes are also shown (although see a crash LIVE on-location is far more exciting). But why are we hoping these drivers, driving at mad speeds, crash into one another? So that we can see damage? Or worse, so we can see crushed drivers corpse? Let's not be so morbid.

Anyway that's for the race.

What surrounds the race may be what others are looking for.
Stages for entertainment are set-up everywhere with the better acts at Zone1 while the mass throng to Padang for the post-race mega concert.

Let me tell you this, Zone1 is one place you'll be spending a lot of money to enter (IF you're buying, instead of benefitting from a friend's generosity). But the bands/performers... well know that it is not their solo concert and they are only there for a showpiece. So if you're a fan, track these stars to their own show instead of forking our crazy money for a 45min/1hr set. It really doesn't do justice to all your years of support. But hey, at least these stars get paid from F1 organisers. Or perhaps they've haven't been booked elsewhere so this is their only chance for an income.

Whatever the reason is, entertainment is so-so and not worth buying tickets for (unless you get them cheap/er from Carousell or eBay or some third-party seller). Lots of second hand dealers outside the gates. Some watch the race then attempt (sometimes successfully) to sell it to concert hunters who can't pay full price.
I say, that's economy. And that's also showing the F1 organisers a big bad finger for making F1 prices so damn expensive.

Oh yes, if you're from a foreign country, good luck. You'lll be paying TOP dollar for your stay in one of our hotels. Even backpack hostels have upped their prices cos we know you're coming, and you'll need at least 2 nights stay in our beautiful (money hungry) country.
So we'll bleed you.

Fancy saving your money on hotel? Sure. Here's an alternative. Buy a ticket to one of the after-race dance party. (if there are tickets still available). Perhaps cheaper than hotel. Plus you can sleep in the nightclub/disco and pretend that you're drunk. Then check into the circuit when day light comes.
Otherwise, good luck with your accomodation with some hotels even sold-out.

F&B inside the circuit is crazy. Food prices are jacked up so high. You're paying double for meals and drinks. Here's the standard. My local coffeeshop sells kopi at $1.20. Now you go compare the prices inside. Good luck.

So really, the ones who can really really really afford it are the ones in the Paddock Club. I would like to assume that they have all it takes to be there with millions of excess. (otherwise good luck to their justification for being in a zone that costs 3 months pay cheque for others).
These people get zipped around in buggies, have escorts to bring them to seats and even freeflow drinks and food (while we the paupers have to pay for our feed outside... heck they don't even leave scraps for us!)

Anyway I'm sour. I'm sour because the sheer sight of inequality... will be seen at the race. The have and the have-not.. and those trying to have (but actually have nothing).

Sad world we live in. Will share with you photos from my previous experience at F1.",10-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:22.028379

Some swear that they will get a better view by watching it on tv, live. But in all honesty, the tv doesn't allow you to smell burning rubber.
Singapore is proud to be the night street circuit host and I can see why. It's a great country, safe and clean, and very very efficient in erecting all the safety cages in preparation for the race. Price wise, it's affordable. Only a few thousands for 3-days of mad race fun.
Hotels may set you back a bit if you're a travelling tourist. But for the true love of sports, money must not matter. Start saving for next year's race, NOW!",09-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 06:46:23.151113
