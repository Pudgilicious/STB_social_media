I paid SGD 120 for 2 Adults and 2 children which is very steep. The cable cars are clean and well maintained you get amazing views of Sentosa Island and The Waterfront it's the kind of thing you might try once the kids loved it though. They also have dinning packages were you can have a meal while you enjoy the views which seems like a great option for couples but with children just riding the cable cars was fun enough just wished it was cheaper.,02-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:56:10.490544

First getting to Faber Hill or Harbour point is a challenge and then the cable car ride is only for some 10 odd minutes, which is hardly exhilarating.

Tickets are $35 at the gate however we purchased ours through Booking.com for $24.50.
On the island there are lots of tourist sites (universal studios, aquarium, beach clubs, Merlion ....). Buy the round trip ticket and it includes the second cable car ride to Siloso point. Currently there is a Star Wars themed sand sculpture exhibition plus international competition on the beach which is well worth a look.

- Our toddler was in awe of the view from above during daytime and nighttime. We are lucky that it was not that hot since the cars don't have AC. Tip: Do not ride the cable cars during summer or sunny day.
- The price is right if it means that they get to maintain it, pay there crew right and keep everyone safe and happy. I feel that they were able to do that. For discounts, try looking for package deals

And let's not forget in recent history a ship tore one of these cars off the cable. FACT.

Maybe I'm just not a cable car guy.

I would be so bold as to say The Cable Guy with Jim Carrey was more memorable. Even with Giles bringing beers along for the ride.

Maybe I should just lay cable.

HINT: so as your day doesn't just revolve around this cable, why not add a Southern Ridges walk, including Henderson Waves and gelato and art at Gillman Barracks. Tag the cable on just for bucket lists or something.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:56:19.915595

It does provide interesting views of Sentosa’s development, and this activity is enjoyable for young children. If you were to join, might as well take it from Mt. Faber to Sentosa (rather than just the portion between Harbourfront and Sentosa), as otherwise it would be too short a ride. Surprisingly, they don’t sell one-way tickets. This is annoying as the only way to find transport at Mt. Faber Station is via Grab.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:56:20.294138

If you time it well you can get both day and night views. You can also go to Mount Faber Park to get good city views from the heights. I took a one day sky pass which allows you to board and get down at each station on both the lines once. To get city views travel on Mt.Faber line. To get views of Sentosa and its beaches travel on Sentosa line. I would suggest to travel on both since both cable cars and the views you get are different.,07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:56:26.837874

We opted to take the ride around late afternoon so we can get the view of the sunset and a bit of night lights. I also advise to go around this time as the cable car can get a bit hot inside during the day since it's not air conditioned.

It would have been more sensible to renew the previous membership when it expired as the renewal rates are lower, but we didn't quite get around to it. Still, it's not bad value for $135 for a year for a family of 4. Luckily our youngest is still below the threshold level of 4 years of age - otherwise it's a full adult membership rate to add him to the package.

I'd say it was worth the price, as the views were quite good, even though not as impressive as you can get at the bay. Still not bad at all. Stations are located in strategic points from which you can walk around and explore the area. I'd say cabins are a bit dated, and windows start to hinder photo opportunities, and in general they feel a bit too closed to truly enjoy the surroundings. Nevertheless, it's fun!

Keep in mind that if you are taking it from the Mt Faber station (and returning there), then be sure you can call up a taxi (or know your bus routes), otherwise transport there is a bit scarce...

The ride itself is amazing. We started from the Mount Faber and went all the way to the Sentosa Station. The views from the Mount Faber to Harbourfront are amazing and so are the views from Harbourfront to Sentosa station.

Between the Harbourfront and Sentosa, the car goes to its highest point that provides a nice birds eye view of the entire Sentosa Island. From here, you can see the Universal Studios, Water park, Merlion, etc. This is the best part of the ride

The other line (Imbiah - Sentosa - Siloso) offers an excellent view of the beach side of the Sentosa Island. It is a good way to go to the Siloso point and Siloso Fort.

Overall, the ride itself is enjoyable, but for many the cost would be a deal breaker.

One way takes about 20 minutes (Mount Faber to Sentosa) and 10 minutes (Imbiah to Siloso)",04-2019,Family,2020-01-29 18:56:37.936877

We purchased the $55 dollar special deal. This gave us unlimited rides and entry to two Attractions. In the cable car you had the best views of this area you would want to see.
Just breathtaking views and overall a photographers delight. I know i took over 100 photos and some videos.
There is even a massive waterpak as one of the attractions.
There are far too many to list.
We went to the Butterfly Exhibit and this was wonderful. Highly Recommended. They even have bugs from giant rhino bugs right down to deadly spiders alive and on display. The scorpions made me look twice. All sizes and shapes.
The second exhibit was the Massive Merlion. A three minute video on his history than in and up you go in the lift to the 10th floor gives you access to the lookout on his head and the lookout in his mouth. Stunning views and photo opportunities from both lookouts.
This is Highly Recommended.
The entry tickets also allow you to ride the Mono Rail between different locations.

I joined as member because my kids love the ride, enjoyed the view even after riding so many times. Try to avoid HOT SUNNY day, the cable car can be a bit stuffy. AND avoid thundery lightning day, they close the service for safety concern. Best time to ride is evening and if you can get the timing right, hop on around 8pm, you get to see fireworks from the nearby universal studio entrance.
There are 2 cable car system, so if you are annual member, you ride both for free, and the car entrance to sentosa is free too. Try both cable car, the one within the island is shorter and only 3 stations, only if you are going to the beach will this make it worth the trip. If you go during day time, you see people playing the zip line across below the cable car screaming...
If there is no crowd, the staff are nice enough to allow you or your group into one cable car by themselves, no need to share and your kids can scream all they want.
Lastly, have a great dining experience on top of mount faber, the other side of the cable car station, the western food is delicious, service is great and the view is wonderful, cool and romantic.Nice toilet by the way, see thru glass to the cable car outside while washing your hands.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:57:46.054177

Lucky we did because it was a bit scary at first but fantastic experience to get a 360 degree view of parts of Singapore, the harbour & Sentosa.
For the $35 you not only get a ride to the island & back but you also get a ride on the cable car on Sentosa. This too is a great experience as you ride high above the lush green canopy & view parts of the island & outer harbour.
Have lunch & a stroll around the island & get back on the cable car to take you home.

The Cable Car is worth that one experience even if it is just a 10 minute ride with a waiting time of 10-15 minutes or worse if there are large tour groups at the same time as you. The best way to do it is to take a one way ride from Mount Faber Station to Sentosa Station or beyond. That ensure that you fly over the harbour and enter into Sentosa which is the most scenic part of the ride. It also means that you cross at least one stop and get sufficient time on the ride.
The cable car moves at a fairly slow and even pace. Those afraid of heights might feel uncomfortable especially while looking down. But my 3 year old son could handle it so it shouldn't pose too much of a risk to anyone. A one way ride is enough - you do want to see the harbour sights and also the Sentosa attraction from above.

The staff there advised that such type of tickets must be redeemed on Level 3 at Vivo City.

I went all the way to find the place as advised by the cable car staff, and came back with the formal passes redeemed.

Upon using the passes to get on the cable car, other staff told me that I had to go back down to Level 1 to exchange for the tickets for the trip, which I did.

Went all the way back to Level 1 from Level 10 in the 30 degree hot humid weather. And then surprisingly, the staff at the ticketing counter told me this time that the ""Cable Car"" included in the Fun Pass for Santosa can NOT be used for the cable car to Santosa. I questioned him why his staff didn't tell me when I first came to redeem my eTickets. The reply from him was I can make a complaint!!! That's it.

As a tourist with 2 small children from overseas, I didn't know that the Cable Car included in Santosa Fun Pass is not for Cable Car to Santosa. When I started explaining what's happened to other staff, my 7 years old son just told me in a different language ""Dad, they don't care what you have complained at all"".",07-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:58:31.394664

It is worth taking it from Mount Faber because you get to see two sets of scenery. The scenery is over the waters and it is beautiful! We took the cable car around 5:30pm the sun was starting to set and it was great! There is no air conditioning, it is open air, the doors have large slits to let in the air from outside. Note: It is free to take the tram out from Sentosa, it takes you to Vivo, a large mall, go down two escalators to the public transportation area. While at Vivo, you can go to Irvins which is in Basement 1 or 2, to buy Salted Egg Potato chips, casava chips, or fried fish skins...super yummy!",03-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:59:10.334227

It’s definitely the most expensive and the lengthiest and if you like long queues and standing out in the heat, then definitely pay the exorbitant entrance fee.

We booked online but you still have to stand in line at the ground floor of the station house to collect you actual paper ticket. Then more queueing at the top of the station house as you wait for the cable car to arrive. Granted, the views from the cable car are spectacular and our kids loved the ride, but it was very quick and we were soon on a Sentosa and walking down a long hill to the bus stop to wait 15-minutes for the Universal Studios bus, which is a misnomer as the bus serves ALL attractions so it was jammed packed. A 10 minute hard fought bus ride later we arrived at our destination.

We discovered too late that the last cable car departs Sentosa at 6:30 pm (seriously?) so we had to find an alternative route off Sentosa which was when we discovered that a regular city bus runs from the mainland directly to Universal Studios and back. And there was no charge back to the mainland (you only pay for the service to Sentosa).

So, in conclusion, don’t waste your time or money taking the cable car - take the bus. It will only cost you a $1 or $2 and will take you far less time while being a whole lot more comfortable.",02-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:59:17.303835

It was almost 3 years since our last ride when we were back to Singapore for a month. The queue was not long even though it is on a Saturday. Nevertheless, it is still the most expensive way to enter Sentosa.

Initially a little apprehensive about riding in the sky (great heights), both kids got over their fear and loved the ride a lot. For us parents, it is a joy to see their happy faces.

For residents in Singapore, suggest that you can consider getting an annual membership (SGD 39 per individual and SGD 135 for a family of four), taking a ride every quarter will more than pay for your membership fee.

Looking forward to another cable car ride with my kids in the next few weeks. Will plan for a night time ride.",03-2018,Family,2020-01-29 18:59:17.657335

It was really a very wonderful experience. It will conquer your fear of traveling via cable car and think it was a first time experience.

The Sentosa line only takes you within the island of Sentosa, while the Mt. Faber line connects the mainland to Sentosa. We had a combined pass of both the lines. We took a cab to the Mt. Faber station, which overlooks the whole city and provides a nice view. A 15 minute ride, going over the hills, the marina and the sea, catching glimpses of the cityscape brought us to Sentosa.

The Mt. Faber line starts from a hill called Mt . Faber on the mainland and takes you over the city and into the island of Sentosa. You get great views of the city and the skyline. Being a family of 4, we had the whole car to ourselves and my kids really enjoyed the view from the top and the 15 min journey. The cars have openings to let the air in and also glass windows. Interestingly when we were coming back, it started to rain and made the whole trip quite interesting with droplets of water coming. The trip also takes you over the harbour, where you can see ships docked in Singapore. If you are lucky, you might even glimpse a nice cruise liner right under your feet as you pass by !!!

We used the Sentosa line just for fun, seeing the Merlion from up in the air, seeing the shoreline and the beach etc. However one may choose to avoid it totally.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-29 18:59:54.883615

REMEMBER: if you like me and plan to visit and go around Sentosa or even universal studio for more than 3 times a year, then better get the FABER LICENSE pass -> allows you for unlimited use of the cable car AND the sentosa express train for 1 year (i got the family deal which allows me to give 4 people the license). It was 139 SGD for the whole family (110 SGD if renewal from Islander card)

I like to bring friends or family or relatives to cable car trip in Sentosa so, this card is no brainer. I can get discount when buying ticket for them too (50% sky pass ticket)

Within the 3rd visit to the isle using cable cars you have earned back your investment already compared to others who use single day pass or 1 trip pass etc.

Like best: ease of use for traveling in Sentosa, beautiful view. Safe for children and not scary since it is encapsuled.

Bring camera, selfie stick.
Sit in balanced manner (e.g., not all passengers in one side)

We boarded the cable car from Harbour Front tower 2, just 5 mins walk from VivoCity mall.

Tickets were fairly priced, $33 per adult for a return trip on the Faber and Sentosa line. Faber line is the link from Mount Faber up till Sentosa island, then we alighted and walked about 3 mins to Imbiah Lookout station to hop on the Sentosa line which we took to Siloso beach, got off for a bit of sightseeing then boarded again to Merlion station to view the famous giant Merlion statue. The price tag per ticket wasn't too bad if you have plans to visit the whole island and stop over at Mount Faber for some nice views.

The cable car itself was quite solid and it didn't shake mid air. Though it can get super hot and humid due to the hot weather and there were no fans or air cond available in the cable car except cooling fresh air from outside which we could hardly feel. So be prepared to sweat, and definitely wear beach or short clothing.

There is apparently free wifi, but none of us could log on. The staff wouldn't call us a taxi but said we could go back to Vivo City (no extra charge) and get a cab from there.

If you use govoyagin, ask your hotel reception if you can print out there most will oblige, now that I saved there will try on the night safari and gardens by the bay, every bit helps.
Also if using govoyagin on the top of page change the money to Australian dollars and use your normal credit card as would not accept nab traveler card.

Highly recommended.,"I'm not one who likes to go to high buildings or hill tops just for the view. But we got tickets from our hotel package with Rasa Sentosa and decided to utilise them. It was surprisingly great!

Next to Rasa Sentosa is the new Siloso Point Station. We started from here and did the new Sentosa Line. After that, we alighted at Imbiah Station and walked a short distance to the Sentosa Station and did a round trip on the Faber Line.

Compared to Singapore Flyer, the views you get here are more varied and interesting. On the Sentosa Line, you see Siloso Beach and the coast line and move on to lush vegetation passing several attractions, including the new skywalk to the Fort. On the Faber Line, you get to see Adventure Cove and maybe bits of Resorts World (I'm not sure), the Resorts World Beach Resort and the Keppel Bay area. It's particularly nice to get a bird's eye view of Adventure Cove. People afraid of heights may find the stretch crossing the sea a little scary.

We went at 1 p.m. so the cable car felt like a sauna when it got to open sea. Thankfully there was a nice breeze on the return trip. Highly recommended to go before it gets too hot or in the evening to catch the sunset.

I can't say if we will pay full price for this ride but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience!",06-2016,Family,2020-01-29 19:05:24.939987

If you go to Sentossa Island then the cable car is a must, it travels from the mainland to Sentossa Island and then from one side of Sentossa to the other.
Just be wary that if you scared of heights this may cause you some concern as the cable car is enclosed in a glass case and provides 360 degree views and also you are about 50 metres plus above the ground. But if you don't have a fear of heights then I highly recommend it make sure that you camera is fully charged as you will get some fantastic shots of Singapore.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-29 19:05:26.264712

There were some cars with tables (food and drinks served) as well, although I am unsure how to get those. They dont have AC inside but at such a height you will not miss AC but rather enjoy the natural wind. The speed depends upon the weather and traffic.

You can take the cable car and get down at different stations in between to enjoy them and come back! It depends upon you how long you stay at each station.

Due to being on a cruise, we were eligible for a 15% discount on the tickets (on production of your cruise passenger card).

The views as you can imagine are great (especially on a sunny day!) and, due to going fairly early, it was fairly quiet and we had a cable car to ourselves each time we needed to change. We didn’t spend as much time here as we first planned, but it was a nice way to start the day and take in some different views of Singapore. When we left, the queue had started to get quite long so I was pleased we didn’t leave it too late.

The view is absolutely outstanding and I would think you might spend most of the trip taking pictures.

The terminal on Sentosa Island gives you further travel options to get around the island, making it easy to do so.

One thing to remember is on the return journey, if you are going to catch a taxi to proceed further, it is better to get off at the Harbour Front station and not the Mount Faber. This is because Harbour Front has access to a taxi rank and an MRT station, whereas if you get off at Mt Faber, you will have to call your own taxi as there is no cab rank there.

The price seems steep if you just want to get to the island and the shuttle is probably better.

Whilst high up the views are underwhelming, so much building work is being done along with passing next to a major import shipping hub just allows you to see endless rows of shipping containers and some men pouring concrete.

There is nothing in the cars or before to tell you what you are looking towards and indeed one end of the line seems to have nothing to get off and see.

Buying tickets online beforehand did not help skip the queue. We had to stand in the same line as everyone else (who are buying tickets) to redeem tickets/vouchers. In fact we felt that people buying tickets on the counter got better bargain/discounts and free gifts while we just got a paper version of our tickets redeemed.

Directions: While arriving from VivoCity we found directions to the starting point bit tricky. It also involved significant walking while we had to keep an eye on the signage.

Review: The cable cars are one of three transport options to get to the Sentosa island. The cable cars were clean and at all the stops the cars came quite frequently. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a ride. So it's safe, fast, efficient, the views are pleasant and unlike monorail it does not get crowded.

* Faber line starts from Mountfaber and goes till Sentosa. You can also board the cable car from Harbourfront Tower 2 floor 15 and travel up to Mountfaber, there you can spend some quality time with nature and again board back cable car which will go to Sentosa via Harbourfront.
* Ticket price is 35 SGD per head if you buy it from the ticket counter , However you can purchase tickets online with much discounted prices ( we got them worth 19SGD ). This ticket includes to and fro both.
* It is a well managed and enjoyable activity. I would recommend it totally to everyone.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 19:10:27.633538

We tried Skyline Luge for 3 times. This is karting, so I recommend wearing shorts.

Adventure Cove Waterpark is a place where you float on inflatable ring
and then you get into the fish tunnel.

Sentosa Merlion is a Symbol of Singapore. You can get on both Merlion's head and mouth, but my favorite part is the pool behind Merlion. I highly recommend this pool. It is designed in the style of the Spanish architect Gaudi.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 19:11:11.415739

,1,11,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Jake G,541886815,19-11-2017,4,Lovely Views!,"My fiancee and I spent the weekend in Singapore in October. She wanted to see a new country, and I wanted to take her to a romantic location to propose. :) When she first saw the Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa line) running near the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa Island, her eyes flew open wide and she said, ""WE HAVE TO RIDE THAT!!!"" I was happy to oblige and eager to ride it myself.

The Singapore Cable Car has 2 lines, the Sentosa line that takes you along Sentosa Island and connects you to the second line, the Mount Faber line, which takes you off the island and to the top of Mount Faber. There are several stations per line that allow you to disembark or to connect to the other line. We used our round-trip ticket to get us off Sentosa (where we caught a taxi and went downtown), and later to return us to Sentosa at sunset.

The view is spectacular...ESPECIALLY at sunset!!!

Prices weren't cheap, but they weren't that expensive either. Depending on the time of day that you ride, you may get lucky and get your own car, but be prepared to share it with other groups...a ticket on the Singapore Cable Car doesn't guarantee you your own car. Each car holds 8-10 people, depending on how full they want to fill it. Cars move at a brisk pace and can sway a little if you move around or the winds are blowing. Those who have a fear of heights may want to pass on this experience.

We took many memorable pictures and had a wonderful time cuddling in our car at sunset as we returned to the Sentosa line from Mount Faber, and later as we rode the entire Sentosa line after dark to take us back to the beginning of the Sentosa line near the Sentosa Merlion. We do not regret riding and would gladly go again if we ever find ourselves in Singapore once more. Our only gripe is that we wish it would have been longer. I realize that building something of that scale is absurdly expensive, but we wished there had been a 3rd line to take us deeper into the city.

Ride away and enjoy the views!",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:12:07.557698

Why mixed feeling? I have been to many cable car trip in most cities, Singapore's cable car sky view is probably the least exciting.

The dining loop is between Mount Faber and Sentosa. Anyway, you will get a free ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber if you decided to park your car around Vivo City Shopping Mall (Why not?). The dining is around 1.5 hours, as you eat the sky get darker and more romantic along the way. The experience is very private and you can share your happiness with your partner loudly for once without bothering anyone.

I recommend one of the partner to select the vegetarian option. The dishes are more unique.

It was £32UK for the trip from Sentosa to Faber then back to Harbour for two people, £16 each. Not cheap as a form of transport but cheap for the experience.

You can buy a ticket that allows you access to both Sentosa and Faber Peak. It is a bit confusing when trying to read the information and pricing however think of it as a round trip ticket with one stop allowed at each cable car point. So you can go to Sentosa from Singapore, then hop on the line that runs across Sentosa, then back onto the line that takes you back to Singapore and up to Faber Peak then back down to your starting point. Worth going to Faber peak and having a drink up there as the view is wonderful. We went during the week and was very quiet, no queues at all, Each cable car can take 8 people and they will fill them up when there are lots of people but if not many you get your own car! May be different on the weekend when people who live in Singapore go over to Sentosa. I felt Sentosa is more for those with children however adults can enjoy the various attractions, beaches etc. The ride across is fun for everyone!",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:13:35.389277

First, you need to go to Habourfront Tower which you can ride MRT (Circle and Purple LIne). Then, head to Mount Faber First and if you want to spend sometimes there, get out off the cable car and enjoy the picturesque view. There was a souvenir shop, too. After that, go back to cable car station and take a ride to Sentosa Station via Harbourfront Station. For us, we did not get out of the cable car and took ride to Sentosa. But, one of the family who got out of the car need to get in again with our cable car to sentosa station. Whatever, we enjoyed the ride with them, too. We are amazed by the color of the sea which is very clean and green. Moreover, you can see some private boats along the shore. For the line of Harbourfront to Mount Faber, you can enjoy the green views which is the mountain sides.

It starts from Harbor Front 15th floor. You shall be surprised to note that the cable car is boarded from the 15th floor (exact floor may be different) of a building. One takes an escalator to board the cable car.

The capsule of the cable car can easily house 4-6 people; but the operators give all privacy to visitors by housing them to independent capsule on basis of their own company. Maybe that during huge visitor traffic they alter their practice.

The cable moves above the sea line that differentiates the Singapore from Sentosa island. The cable starts rising high while crossing the water beneath. You shall sight yachts, steamers in the waters below. One shall sight the approaching Sentosa island and the Singapore left behind. The Sentosa island is housed with several attractions and resorts. From that height one is able to see the top surface of most of the attractions. The journey is small but interesting.

Now, I must make the most important fact. While returning back by the same cable car do not disembark at the Harbor front point wherefrom you had embarked the cable. Keep sitting and inform the staff their that we want to see Mount Faber point. No extra amount is charged for this additional trip. They shall allow you to continue beyond and within minutes your journey explores an extension towards Mount Faber. It is a high spot encircled with many trees. It has a small shop and an open restaurant. You can spend some time over there and then return back by embarking the cable once again.

The journey shall conclude at the same place where you had started from. Good experience indeed.",03-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:14:30.816722

The cable car is so far away from the city that it wasn't even worth taking a photograph. the main view is of container ships, docks and cranes. It cost around $50 dollars for the Faber Line. When you get to Sentosa there is another cable car that crosses the island for about $13 dollars which I'm sure would be far more interesting and a third of the price. On the return we stayed on the cable car to mount Faber hoping that we might get a decent view but that was worse. Trees obscured all the possible views.
I would advise you to get the free shuttle bus or the cheap monorail (about $4 I think) across the bridge to Sentosa and use the cable car on the island itself.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:15:07.675059

It was also a unsettling to see the safety netting near the entrance. Apart from that it was a great view and it was nice to visit the cable car museum and the gift shop. We purchased two wish bells at the gift shop, wrote our wishes on the bells and tied them to fence with everyone else's outside the giftshop. It's nice to so something meaningful/sentimental on holidays. It was lovely to read the comments on other people's bells as it seems a lot of newlyweds place bells there as well as people wishing for health, happiness and prosperity for themselves and their families.

Views from the cars are excellent, and I’m pleased to say they no longer block any of the windows with pictures - it used to happen. Cars can get rather warm. The opening windows help, but on the Faber to Sentosa route, they’re only on one side of the car, and don’t get much airflow if on the downwind side. However fan have now been fitted, so we always find the temperature pleasant.
You can buy tickets to cover both the route from Sentosa to Mt Faber, and also the route on the island from Imbiah to Siloso. Although the latter is quite short, it does give some stunning views of the forest on Sentosa as well as parts of Singapore. The small extra cost of buying the ticket for both routes is well justified. I do prefer the unlimited use tickets, it’s worth the extra as it’s great to also do the ride after dark.
Local residents will find the Faber Licence outstanding value at S$39 as it gives unlimited access to the cable-cars for a year, sadly it’s not available to visitors.
Most of the time boarding is quick, with very short queues, if any. Peak times can be difficult. Tour groups on occasions will use a sequence of cars, so you have to wait until they’ve all gone through. But overall, on weekdays we’ve had little delay using the cars.
Disabled access is good, with lifts when necessary. Toilets are easily found at all Sentosa stations, naturally they are always very clean. Mt Faber can be a problem, the toilets are at the foot of the steps down from the gift shop, turn right at the bottom. The signs aren’t obvious, so ask staff for help if necessary.
Our first visit to Sentosa was by cable-car (in those days it was cable-car or ferry, the causeway did not exist). We’ve enjoyed every ride. It is expensive, but unforgettable.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 19:18:34.684910

The cable car runs form Sentosa island to Harbourfront terminal and then on to Mt. Faber.

The cable car is very expensive to ride - there are no one way fares and the fare for a return trip is $SG26 each - no discount.

As a result most people now take the monorail from the new Harbourfront terminal (some 150m away) - the cost is $SG 4 each way. The new harbourfront terminal is at the entrance to Harbourfront metro station.

At the Mt Faber terminal ther is no public transport form the top to the bottom - no bus service etc - so you either walk down the hill or catch the cable car back to Harbourfront. At Mt. Faber there is only an expensive restaurant - even the lookout is now closed and can not be accessed.

As a result the most popular route to access Sentosa Island is now the monorail.

When hopping on the cable car, the car moves slowly along the platform so you have to hop on while it's moving. Probably not recommended for anyone with walking difficulties.

There is a couple of different lines to travel and the staff were helpful with advice on which route to take to get the most from the trip.

The cable car goes quite high, but the smoothness and comfort of the cars worked well to relax my wife, who is uncomfortable with heights sometimes.

We were lucky as it wasn't that busy, but I imagine it can be sometimes.

We spent a couple of hrs getting on and off the cable car having a look around etc, and we're glad we weren't rushed.

To get the pass, you have to go back to the station that you bought your ticket from, then tell them you want to pay for a year pass. They will instruct you to go to a website then you have to wait two weeks for confirmation and I stopped there.

Although I’d made no plans to go to Sentosa Island, when I found out that’s where the cable car stops, I thought I may as well explore the island a bit.

The cable car is definitely worth doing. It’s a nice little trip and you get to see some good sights. It’s obviously a bonus if you’re on there around sunset time.

There’s a number of different ticket options which you can combine with attractions at Sentosa to make the package price a bit cheaper. There’s also a cable car on Sentosa Island, so you can even buy a ticket where you can have unlimited rides on both cable cars. I opted for just the Mount Faber cable car return ticket which was $29 / £16.

Be sure to walk around Mount Faber before or after you get the cable car. It’s a nice little walk with good photo opportunities. There’s the highest point, some colourful steps and the bell of happiness.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 19:20:13.352749

,1,11,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/yeauejen,463218387,27-02-2017,5,Best way to see Sentosa,"I am a 'frequent flyer' on the Singapore Cable Car, thanks to its attractive and affordable annual membership package. I would say that a ride on the Cable Car is a very enjoyable experience-- soaring hundreds of metres above with a very scenic view of the Keppel Harbour and Sentosa itself.

The Cable Car actually has two separate lines- Mount Faber Line running between Sentosa Island and mainland Singapore, and Sentosa Line that runs within the island. I would recommend that you buy the $33 (adult) / $22 (child) Sky Pass, which allows you one full loop each on both lines. If you want more, you could top up $1 for one additional loop or $10 for unlimited rides until the end of the day. Do note that if you wish to top up, it must be made at the time where you bought your ticket. You cannot top up additional rides after you have bought the Sky Pass.

I will usually take the Cable Car at Mount Faber Line's HarbourFront station. HarbourFront Cable Car station is located at Level 15 of HarbourFront Tower 2, a 16-storey building. From HarbourFront, take Exit B (use the ticket gates located between the North East Line and Circle Line escalators as they were less crowded and nearer to that exit) that leads you to ground floor of the HarbourFront Centre. From there I would take the escalator up to Level 2 and exit by the side entrance beside KFC. Walk straight and take the escalator down to ground floor again. Walk straight along the corridor until you walk past a real estate showroom and a chiropractic clinic. From there, turn left and walk to the back (by this time you should be able to see the cable cars right above you) until you reach a glass sliding door that says ""South Entrance"". That would be the entrance to HarbourFront Cable Car station.

At HarbourFront Cable Car station (an intermediate station between Mount Faber and Sentosa), I would usually take the cable car towards Mount Faber as they tend to be less crowded during the weekends -- Most people start and end their journey at HarbourFront, and will therefore alight at the ""platform"" where you will board the cable car.

From HarbourFront to Mount Faber, the cable car takes you high above Telok Blangah Road and West Coast Highway viaduct, a spectacular sight when there is traffic. Slightly up the route, you will get to see buses entering and exiting HarbourFront Bus Terminal located on the other side of Telok Blangah Road. The cable car then takes you up the slopes of Mount Faber to the cable car's terminus at Faber Peak.

Mount Faber station is located on the upper floor of Faber Peak, an elegant hilltop building with a souvenir shop, alfresco restaurants, and a ballroom. There is generally nothing much to see around Mount Faber, but you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Central Business District, Keppel Harbour, and even as far as the docks at Pasir Panjang. If you wish to venture further, you can take a 15-20 minutes walk down the hill to Henderson Waves, a large and magnificently designed pedestrian bridge high above a busy road. For the adventurous ones, beyond Henderson Waves you can take a 10km hike that takes you through the Southern Ridges to Kent Ridge (5 MRT stops away!).

From HarbourFront to Sentosa, you will soar high above the Keppel Harbour where you will get to see Batam ferries entering or leaving the ferry pier. If you are lucky, you can see one or two cruise ships docked at the Singapore Cruise Terminal. Moments later, you will find yourself soaring high above Adventure Cove Waterpark, with people splashing around the two waterslide features and the wave pool. If you look towards your left (facing forward), you will get to see some of the Universal Studios Singapore's attractions (most notably the Far Far Away Castle and Battlestar Galatica's twin roller coasters.

Sentosa cable car station is located at the centre of Imbiah Lookout where many of Sentosa's attractions are located -- Skyline Luge, Images of Singapore, Madame Tussauds Singapore, 4D Adventureland, etc. The station building itself has a Cable Car Souvenir Shop, a cable car museum (closed for renovations as of end Feb 2017), a Subway food outlet, and Sentosa ticketing counters where you can buy tickets for almost all attractions within the island.

To change to Sentosa cable car line, turn right after exiting the souvenir shop and head downhill (you will walk past the ticket counters and Subway). Continue downhill until you see a zebra crossing that leads you to Sentosa Line's Imbiah station.

Imbiah station is an intermediate station between Sentosa Line's terminals, Merlion and Siloso Point. I would recommend taking the cable car towards Siloso Point as the Imbiah-Siloso Point stretch is significantly longer than the Imbiah-Merlion stretch. Towards Siloso Point, the cable car will take you high above Mount Imbiah's jungle (part of Sentosa Nature Discovery). En route, you will see MegaZip Adventure Park at the top of Mount Imbiah, complete with three flying fox ropes that run all the way to an islet off Siloso Beach.

At Siloso Point station, there is a 7-Eleven and a coconut ice cream store. Attractions around the station include Fort Siloso Skywalk (an 11-storey open walkway), Fort Siloso, Rasa Sentosa Resort, and the western end of Siloso Beach. From Siloso Point station, you can change to Sentosa's free shuttle bus and Beach Tram, both of which have stops located within the station's vicinity.

From Imbiah to Merlion station, the cable car runs steeply downhill, flying directly above Skyline Luge's tracks and the Skylift. Merlion station is located at Merlion Park, directly opposite Sentosa Express' Imbiah station. From Merlion, you can visit the largest (and only) attraction in the area, Sentosa Merlion. Alternatively, you can take a leisurely stroll along the walkway to Resorts World Sentosa or to the beaches.

Here are some tips on visiting Singapore Cable Car:

- Cable car cabins can get quite warm on sunny days. Mount Faber Line's cable car cabins are fitted with two small PC fans and has a roof window that allows better ventilation. The windiest sections on the Cable Car are between HarbourFront and Sentosa on the Mount Faber LIne and between Imbiah and Siloso Point on the Sentosa Line.

- If it rains, try not to close all the windows as the cabin interior can get stuffy and warm real fast. Open the windows a little (for Mount Faber Line, just keep the roof window closed) so that some air gets into the cabin.

- All cabin windows are tinted, so you may want to try taking pictures at the door if you are particular about lighting. Cabin interiors on Sentosa Line are slightly brighter than the ones on Mount Faber Line.

- The cabins are dimly lit at night (two small LEDs).

- Consider topping up $10 for the unlimited rides option so that you can utilise the cable car as a mode of transport within the island. Shuttle buses in Sentosa have long waiting times (and they get crowded at times), and Sentosa Express has, honestly, a limited coverage within Sentosa, and can get very crowded at times.

- Try to avoid weekend late mornings and afternoons as the Mount Faber Line can get quite crowded, especially at Mount Faber and HarbourFront (towards Sentosa) stations. If you are a solo rider or your group is small (2-3 people), there is a very high chance that you will need to share cabin with another solo rider or small group during these hours.

- Waiting times at Mount Faber may be longer during busy periods as they will usually leave every other cabin empty so that more people can board at HarbourFront.

- Lifts at Sentosa Line stations are reserved for the pregnant, elderly, handicapped, and prams only. The main boarding line runs all the way to the escalators, not the lifts.

- If you want to re-board the cable car at any of the four terminal stations, you must line up again at the boarding line as the alighting and boarding areas are separated.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 19:20:39.202991

However, I do find the ticket prices rather overpriced for a relatively short journey from Harbourfront station to Sentosa that only takes a few minutes. It costs 33S$ for a return journey or 43S$ for unlimited rides all day. If you get the unlimited ticket, I recommend riding up to Mount Faber as well for a stunning view of Harbourfront and Sentosa. Be careful during the weekends as the queues for the cable car can get super long. It's probably better to travel to Sentosa first in the morning, then head to Mount Faber in the afternoon to avoid the queues.

I would also recommend travelling on the cable car only when it is a clear day as the rain would obstruct a great deal of your view. If it is raining during your travels, then the Sentosa Express is another speedy option priced at only 4S$ for a return journey.

The unlimited ticket option allows you to redeem a free souvenir magnet from the Singapore Cable Car gift shop, but make sure when you hand over your ticket stub to the staff that you get it back after redeeming your complimentary gift. The gift shop staff took away my ticket stub and I didn't think much of it at the time since I had the blue wristband on me that they give you as well at the Harbourfront ticket office. However, later on when I wanted to get on the cable car at Siloso station, the person checking the tickets said you need to show the ticket stub in addition to the blue wristband. I had to go all the way back to the gift shop and ask for the ticket stub that the staff member had forgotten to give back to me.

The cart which connects the island to Sentosa allows you to see the various hotels and theme parks on the island that you may wish to try out.

The only drawback is that I found at £15 it wasnt exactly the cheapest cable car iv been on. Certainly if you are only looking to get to Sentosa, id recommend walking from the Volvocity shopping centre, which is about a 6 minute walk and free.

Very very busy, don’t bother to access from Faber Point, lots of coach trips and the queues were massive, with the staff manning the cars themselves more interested with their phones than their jobs.
Access is better from Harbour Front, no queues and if you want to take in the views go up from there to Faber Point and don’t get off, just stay in the car for a round trip.
We purchased a day pass for 2 adults, so we could jump on and off through the day and evening (views are phenomenal at night)
Views are breathtaking, it feels really safe and is really clean. 8 people to a car, but we never had more than 4 on any trip.

I am trying to remain unbiased during writing this review but I do need to highlight how miserable my day was probably due to some bad decisions I made along the way. So first and foremost if this is the first time you are getting on a cable car then yeah you will definitely like it. But bear in mind the ride is short... like really really short it kindda finishes before it starts. They will try to make you share the cable car with others and can fit upto 8 people in one cable car! Tried to do fit 6 passengers and a buggy with us during one of our journey. It was the most uncomfortable 3/4 mins ride in the 30 degrees heat. There is no aircon so yeah be prepared to be steamed in the heat. Although i must mention there were some weak air ventilation. If you are the second group on-boarding the cars you are most certainly going to be sitting facing the opposite direction of travel and going to miss the view. If thats ok with you considering the bucks you will be paying then yeah these are no big deal. Now the big mistake I made that ruined my day...i bought cable car return tickets from my hotel concierge, trying to be clever and avoid long queues but didn’t realise this was actually voucher and not tickets. So when I went to the cable car station they sent us to the monorail office to collect tickets. This was about 20 mins walk through two shopping malls, then another 10 mins queue to redeem the tickets from the desk then 15 mins walk back to the harbourfront station. I would recommend you buy the tickets directly from the station and avoid all the extra hassle if you can. Now somehow while getting back to the station I lost my tickets, must have dropped somewhere, this never happened to me before. I went to the ticket desk to ask if they can help me in this situation, they basically told me to bugger off! Spoke to the tour company who issued the vouchers they weren’t helpful either. I was really surprised a big company like sentosa doesn’t have any system in place to assist genuine customers in this kind of situation. I had all my other papers with me showing i paid etc. How difficult was it for them to track and ticket they issued against the vouchers and block it and reissue new ones. No idea! They sympathised and was polite but basically didn’t help me at all. Lesson for me get digital tickets where I can! Given I was there for few days I repurchased the tickets and went to sentosa. But didn’t enjoy the whole experience Probably because I was let down a bit by this whole dramatic incident and ended up spending €132 for what a 15/20 mins cable car ride for two. A return trip will cost you $33 singapore dollars.",02-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 19:24:40.364777

Well worth doing & it would appear that not a lot of tourists know about this as it wasn't overcrowded at all. The cable cars are clean & it's a smooth ride - really memorable.

Yes, this is an attraction and an experience you want to leave Singapore with.
I'm Singaporean, but I've been in this car numerous occasions. The view (on a good day) is stunning. It runs so slowly, you can capture photos and videos with no blur. It is also very relaxing (on a cool day) with the breeze blowing in through specially-cut vents in the cabin. You can fit a family in it and the kids will surely have a great time trying to rock the car (please don't).

When we reached Mt Faber we passed on through the gift shop and took a short walk to a cafe nearby for cold drinks and snacks and a nice view of Singapore below. When we returned to Sentosa, we hopped aboard another cable car line that flies above the island from one end to the other. One ticket to do it all - not too bad at 29SGD per person.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 19:27:04.664304

Try to make it during sunset time on a weekday and if you're lucky you may have the gondola to yourself.
The two lines have a total of 6 stops and you may get off or on anywhere once. Gives you a flexibility to explore Mount Faber, Vivo City Mall and Sentosa Island all-in-one.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 19:27:12.894360

I definitely recommend everyone to do this at least once. Its worth every dollar! The views you get are amazing and allows you to see where everything is on the island. Its great to sit back and relax and enjoy the trip over. Maybe not for those with a big fear of heights as it goes very high.

The ride starts from Mount Fabre station which is easily accessible through HarbourFront Metro Station.. The cable car drops you to the middle of Sentosa island with complete entertainment package in your hands..

The speed of the car ride is smooth and the view is splendid.. When the car crosses jungle at the city side and ropes over the sea in between, the bird's eye view of Sentosa island is near perfect..",10-2015,Friends,2020-01-29 19:27:21.187390
