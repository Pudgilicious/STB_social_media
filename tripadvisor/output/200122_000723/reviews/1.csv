Even in the dark it's an amazing place to visit and there is lighting aplenty. Just stood in awe of the tree structures and gardens.

Along with thousands of other people we walked across to the Marina Bay Sands. Now that is an amazing structure and the place to visit, even if you are not staying there.",07-2019,,2020-01-22 00:07:33.636164

The worlds largest glass greenhouses we later learned. I kept on thinking how did they get these enormous trees into the greenhouses. Another thought that passed through my mind how can they keep these ""bubble"" soooo cold? Yes these greenhouses are cold. Bring a jacket. I also wondering about the inside temperature and the plants well being. Well they seem to be healthy. Anyway it is a must see.",01-2020,,2020-01-22 00:07:33.825007

At night time with the light show everywhere you look is amazing and a real buzz around the gardens.

Great place to take the kids as they really enjoy the different lights and colours that are on show.

Personally I think it‚Äôs best to just stay in the free zone area and not go up to see views they are just ok.

I would make this a top priority to see while in Singapore and If time permits would go in daytime and nighttime to see the difference in atmosphere.",01-2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-22 00:07:38.624359

The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.

On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don‚Äôt do refunds üôÑ, sorry but that‚Äôs poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck. üò≥
So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....
Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-22 00:07:38.812209

The path are easy to follow and not overly crowded. There are signs identifying each tree or flower. The wood sculptures are unbelievable. The free light show far surpasses going to the Night Safari. The lights dance to the classical music. Get there early for a seat on the steps. Standing and looking up for close to an hour is not comfortable. Hang back or immediately head for the exits as it is very crowded as the area empties. Access to the park is easy from the Bayfront MRT.,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:07:42.748516

There are places to eat by the domes, but the better place is Satay by the Bay which has many hawker stalls and a large variety of food.

Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance.

It's only a short ride from the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal (where you can leave you luggage). The super trees were super. Early in the day there are fewer people so we really enjoyed the Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's surprising how huge the domes really are and they have unique displays.

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:07:47.466601

Floral fantasy a little further way from the centre but well worth the hike or shuttle. A small area with floral decorations and interpretations followed by the finale of a 4d film following the path of a dragonfly.....non moving seats on request for those of us with motion sickness

Walking around the clevelry desigined trditonal gardens before going to the tree area was a quiet way to spend some time.

We went though the domes as fast as we could. The gardens are still amazing, everything is very beautiful.
I recommend not getting tickets with klook in advance because they are for the day you chose and if the weather doesn't allow you to do something, you cannot do the activity some other time or get a refund... The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...
We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.

For me, this visit was enlighting and giving a new perspective that science and technology can make our great nature even more WOW (a.k.a jaw dropping, LOL).
This area is quite huge and perhaps need ""strategy"" so you can use your time wisely and get everything=)
If the weather is good, I suggest you to go around the park first and explore the outdoor area..because the two domes (include the pathways) are totally indoor so no worries with the rain.
All the outdoor area is free to explore..no charge..But for two domes they charge entrance ticket and another charge for observation deck+OCBC skyways.
If you are too tired to walk, the outdoor area can be explored by shuttle car that costs SGD8/1 round trip, but me myself prefered to explore the park on foot. You'll have more time to oberserve and find a lot of photo-shoot spots while walking around. But if you go by shuttle, they provide a recording tape that will give you explanation about the garden. In here, you can see heritage gardens, sun pavilion (cactus) and supertrees while walking around.
After going around the outdoor areas, perhaps you can enter the observation deck and OCBC skyways, because they will close earlier than the domes. But in this visit, I didn't buy the ticket for observation deck & OCBC skyways, so I can't tell you a lot about this..may be next time I'll visit =)
After finished observing the outdoor area, I had lunch first before entering the domes. I would recommend to eat beef & prawn satay at Satay by The Bay. It tastes good, good portion, extra juicy meat and not so expensive. SGD7 for 10 beef satay & SGD2/each prawn satay. The prawn is quite big and juicy. My kids love the prawn very much.. If you don't want to be too full, you can eat with rice cake/""lontong"" (in Malay/Indonesian language) that costs SGD1/small square piece. But if you think you need more carb, maybe better if you just buy rice on other stall and you'll get more by paying the same amount. You can also try water chestnut for the drink, and refreshing tropical fruit for your dessert.
After finished my refreshing lunch, I went to the domes. There are 2 domes, the Flower Domes and the Cloud Forest Dome. I entered the Cloud Forest Dome first...From the first time the entrance door was opened, a huge tall indoor waterfall welcomed me..and it's really a jaw-dropping moment=) I think that is one of the wow-factor of this spot. Perhaps you need to bring jacket, because it's a bit cold inside (even the tap water is cold) and a bit splashy if you take photo near the fall. I was mesmerized by the building structure, how they pump gallons of water all the time to make the man-made waterfall looks alive! and how they use sun panel on the supertree top to make everything works. How smart is the creator of this place!!
This dome is bigger than the Flower Dome..you need to walk on several floors to explore all, but don't worry they have lift too and it is totally accessible for wheel chair and baby stroller. They have waterfall observation deck, the lost world zone (full of mist and you can see carnivore plants), stalagmits collection, orchids, and several unique displays & sculptures from many countries. They even have a lego flowery pond =)
After finished with the Cloud Forest Dome, we went into Flower Dome. There are so many collection of trees and flowers that are arranged to certain theme. The theme will change due to certain period. If the weather is good, you can see the sunset from here too..
The collection of the plants are so many and various and they do alive!! Imagine that many kinds of plants that usually live in different types of habitat can live in one same place.. They put complete explanation on a board in front of every plants. There are several sculpture from stem and roots and they were amazing artwork.
In my visit on January, they were in changing process from Christmas theme to Dahlia (Chinese New Year) theme..The Dahlia will be fully displayed on Jan 17 (if I'm not mistaken). But the existing flower arrangement is still even great for me=) We took several photos in front of the themed garden before leaving this dome.
Then here comes the dinner time.. I chose to eat at Pollen. I recommend you to eat here because it's very near to Supertree..so in case you bring children like me..you know, they eat so slow =) so, if they can't finished their meal before the Supertree Light Show, you can watch while you eat =) There are several restaurants that you can pick here, such as Vietnamese Pho, Japanese, Singaporean chicken/pork rice, Texas fried chicken..at that time I tried the Japanese food and it's so yummy...SGD10-12 for one menu. The portion is quite big, I can not finished myself =) If you want complete menu just add few dollars and you'll have miso soup, 2 slices of watermelon and salad. Bring your tumbler and tap water is free all over the park if you want to save money =)
Then here it is..the closing for this day..the light show...it started on 7.45 p.m and last for around 15min. It great to see the light on supertrees flipping following the music and it's a good photo-shoot spot too with the lighted supertrees behind you..=) you can see the lighted singapore flyer and marina bay sands too from here. In case you missed the show, you can wait for the next show on 8.45 p.m.

Flower Dome: Was decorated in all its Christmas glory.

Everyone was oohing & aahing as they walked around

Cloud Forest Dome: the minute you walk in and see the waterfall in all its glory.
There are different levels in this dome with different experiences and views of the dome's floral and fauna species
There are great garden sculptures and phenomenal driftwood carved sculptures.
This dome is worth experiencing!

Christmas Wonderland it wasn‚Äôt.,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.

We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn‚Äôt an option for us.

It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn‚Äôt have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.

At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??

We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn‚Äôt an option.

Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly‚Äôs promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.

After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.

Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.

All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-22 00:09:55.750313

This man-made master piece lives up to the the hype and offers a beautiful experience worth the lifetime.

The Musical Light Show is spectacular and if you fail to get a ticket (limited tickets makes it impossible to accommodate everyone so please book it way in advance) to observe it from the viewing deck

The light show takes place twice every night and is on for 15 minutes. The first show is on at 7:45pm and the second is on at 8:45pm. An extra show on Holidays is added, for which you'll have check on their official website (usually a 9.45pm show) .

There are many spots to see this beauty but our favorite (and Highly recommended) was to lie down on the concrete circles supporting the Garden Towers called Super tree Groves an hour prior to the show as they fill-in fast.

Others being:

From above, on the skywalk of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, decent view minus the music

On the promenade by the Dragonfly Lake, at the park entrance between Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

The Deck / Skywalk exactly above the public loo overlooking the Super tree Groves (have some steps to climb up)

Other than that there are observatories like Cloud Forest, Flower Forest Dome which are worth the dime.

Numerous sculptures and and arts installed in beautiful corners are worth enjoying.

Restaurants are plenty but standards aren't that great so would suggest to stick to McDs in the Garden.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:10:08.750561

I'd definitely say it's worth it and you should go. This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.
The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.
I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out.

PROS:
- Loved the waterfall and carnivorous plants
- Skywalk experience was nice and gave a better feel of the olace
- Good place to spend time wiyh family, specially the light show in evening
- Food is awesome in the food court on the other side of bridge (unable to recall the name but you will find sign boards for guidance)

CONS:
- Christmas carnival was not at all attractive and needs separate ticket.
- Light show must have been special till few years back but now its a common thing around the world, have seen similar stuff in Akshardham in New Delhi India
- The whole experience seemed to be a bit stretched over the day, specially covering everything during day and then waiting for lights to comeon at night
- OCBC Skywalk is mostly non operational in December due to climate issues. They are very cautious and dont allow operations even if there is only a chance of a rain. The online ticket that i purchased was non refundable had they not allowed a delayed entry after arguing for one hour anf waiting for 2.5 hours",12-2019,Travelled solo,2020-01-22 00:11:00.733145

The lightshow as ok, nothing to shout about but perhaps we missed the full experience not being closer and not being able to hear the music.

We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.

Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".

So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change. The MRT counter initially didn't want to assist in breaking up our $10 note, which would have left us stranded.

We visited both the flower room and the cloud forest and were amazed at the level of care, information and sheer wonder on display there. We also went on the 4d motion ride, which was surprisingly a great little diversion.
Now, with it being one of the main sites to see in Singapore, the Gardens always seem to be busy with a capital ‚ÄòB‚Äô.

But the star of the show are The Super trees ... they are FAB -U-LOUS!
We did the sky walk also which is worth doing as you walk up around top of trees on a platform.

Alice and the crew are just one of several themes. Singapore has done an amazing creative job of bringing a variety of examples of floral ecosystems from around the world all housed under an architectural master piece.

The Flower Gardens is huge! One could spend hours exploring and losing yourself in the organic fantasy sculptures. During the Christmas/New Year holiday season there‚Äôs an entire display dedicated to a secular celebration bathed in lights that will leave no doubts about the beauty and magic of the time of year.

Singapore has a reputation for being hot and humid but that‚Äôs not the case in the climate controlled air conditioning inside the Gardens building, a plus for those of us who are impacted by heat related medical issues.

There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro.

Then you can stroll to Satay by the Bay to have some satay. It can be really crowded on weekends and public holidays. Then walk to Supertree Grove to watch the night lighting show (please check the time). The show lasts for 15 minutes. If you watch the last show at 8:30pm, please take note that it is very challenging to catch a cab when the show ends. For express taxi in order to avoid queue, you will be charged $30 to Marina Bay Sands, and other destinations $50 which is ridiculous.

Cloud Forest & Flower Dome:
If you buy tickets for this combo, you‚Äôll able to enjoy it for the whole day. You could also do re entry for both venues. Just make sure to get the re entry stamp at the exit. You‚Äôll spend 45mins to 1 hour minimum at each dome. Remember you can come back to visit these domes for the whole day.

Super Grove Trees:
You will need to get the tickets separately from the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. You‚Äôll spend 45-1 hour here depending on how long you plan your visit. If you‚Äôre shooting a pro photo, it may be longer.

Flora Fantasy:
This is a separate exhibition and no re-entry is allowed. There‚Äôs a 4D Show before you exit. You will spend approximately 45 mins to 1 hour here.

Team Lab showcase:
This is showing currently till March 2020. You will need to ride on the shuttle to get here. You can purchase at the ticket counter for 3 dollars per person. Get a stamp as you are able to ride the shuttle for the whole day.

Tips:
Go early morning so you can enjoy the venues at slow pace without many people.

Go on weekdays if possible. Weekends are usually very crowded. In general, this place is very popular.

Grab Car or take a cab if you can. No need to struggle to get a parking if you‚Äôre driving in the island. This place can be quite competitive to score a parking at peak hour.

If you‚Äôve re entry stamps for Cloud Forest & Flower Dome - you can come back in the evening. You will be able to enjoy TeamLab eggs lights and also the music show at Super Grove Trees.

Hope it helps. Enjoy!",12-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-22 00:11:26.674752

It has two paid parks Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Former is a manmade representation of how forest in Amazon grows, beautiful, falls, mists and walkway created to give you a feel of what it could be.

Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.

Besides there's a OCBC skyway, good for a one time visit but reach before sunset if you want to have nice photos. However the associated laser show towards end of day ( 2 timings) is really interesting.

There's a lot of free area associated with Gardens by the bay which is a very nice 2 hours walk to the Gardens and a good day visit to locals. If you are visiting Singapore for a short time, it can be completely skipped.",01-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-22 00:11:39.691757

Bought separate ticket to the new Supertree observation deck on the first day it was open. don‚Äôt forget to go to the rooftop! Best views in Singapore because you can see the sky deck and super trees, Ferris Wheel and harbour. You don‚Äôt need to do the other Supertree walking path as the views are similar but not as high.

Good selection for lunch at the food hall including gluten free options at the Vietnamese.
We walked back over through marina bay sands and filled in the rest of the afternoon walking around marina bay. A big walking day but a great way to see the area.

The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee.

My suggestion is to visit there by late afternoon, so that you can finish it after the sunset, during which it is more admirable due to the spectacular lighting decorations.
We were little disappointed in the Flower Dome as apart from few varieties of flowers, rest everything was just green and green and lots of varieties of cactus. Nevertheless it was still good to see all that.
Cloud forest is one thing you can‚Äôt miss. Beautifully made and with a tall man made water fall.
Later in the evening, you can visit the tree groves and if u like can have a walk on the sky bridges which connects the tree groves (OCBC Skywalk).
Ince you finish there, just walk over to the other side towards the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Have a stroll and shop if you like and enjoy the Fountain Show on the river side of the Marina Bay. Two shows daily at 8:00 pm and then 9:00 pm

I would recommend the cloud forest. It is a beautiful walk and offers great views of the Marina bay Hotel, singapore flyer and the city. The misting of the mountain was a bit disappointing, but the waterfall was beautiful.

The flower dome was disappointing, they had a great display of Christmas decorations,but the flowers were limited. I wouldn't recommend spending money to see this.

The floral fantasy had a vast array of beautiful flowers, but it was a short expedition. The animation at the end was great, especially for young children.

The shuttle service is helpful, especially if elderly are travelling but it is manageable to walk from the entrance to the 2 indoor garden areas.

The gardens do allow free access to certain parts, but you have to may for the cloud forest, flower dome and floral fantasy. Shuttle service and OCBC walk also requires payment.

I would recommend a full day to take your time. Alternatively is can be done in the afternoon with the viewing at night which is spectacular.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:12:52.904878

We walked by the Dragonfly Lake and then crossed the Dragonfly Bridge into the Supertree Grove.

Unfortunately floral fantasy was closed for maintenance the day we went went, but that just gives us something to look forward to next time.

The flower dome was set up for Christmas with an amazing display and also fully air conditioned which was great given the humidity of outside. The displays were varied and well set out with character hidden through out each section.
Cloud dome how refreshing and cool that was the force of the water fall was surprising and amazing, the walk through was well set out going through each section before heading up to the top of the waterfall there was a short wait which we were well informed about before we even entered the dome they said 30 minutes but it was really only 15. The high walk down the water fall was slightly congested at some points that was more to people suddenly stopping to take photos.
We did the sky walk at night after the first light show, though I hate heights it was a view not to be missed, they limit the numbers on it and you have between 15-30 minutes to complete the walk giving you plenty of time to snap some amazing photos.

‚Ä¶..which you can do seeing admission is free and there‚Äôs a lot to see without having to spend extra.
Of course you can spend extra once inside - on entry to the CLOUD FOREST or the OCBC SKYWAY, not to mention riding the shuttle across the gardens. Of these, we did the last immediately on mainly entry to orientate ourselves to the layout ‚Äì once aware, it was a relatively short and very scenic walk back via SUPERTREE GROVE to the entry near BAYFRONT MRT.
We gave the SKYWAY a miss on account a nearby rumbling electrical storm had entry temporarily suspended and time constraints forced us to miss the CLOUD FOREST. Next time.
Speaking of time ‚Äì if you decided to take in everything on offer I reckon you could spend most of the day here ‚Äì and certainly fill a full morning or afternoon. Our truncated but very satisfying dash thru the place took up abt 2 hours.

PRACTICALITIES ‚Äì no shortage of shaded seating, rest rooms and refreshment outlets.
- the entry to the GARDENS is well signposted from within BAYFRONT MRT ‚Äì you have abt a 300m walk from the platforms.

We managed to get the two dorms and Christmas Wonderland ticket online. It was so smooth and the staff are very welcoming. At 4pm itself, we left Cloud Forest and saw so many visitor queuing up to purchase the Christmas Wonderland ticket. To me, it's worth paying the tickets to get to visit the Gardens By the Bay as a holiday activity.

Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.

Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly.

Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful and totally unique attraction and the two conservatories are (in my view) the standouts. The Cloud Forest replicates the rainforest conditions found in tropical mountain regions and has a huge 35m man made waterfall which you can get to the top of via elevator and slowly descend down via an elevated walkway. It‚Äôs stunningly beautiful with some beautiful plant life on display including different types of ferns and orchids.

The Flower Dome is actually the largest conservatory in the world and houses plant life from Mediterranean and semi-arid regions (there are some excellent cacti and succulent plants on display). It is larger than Cloud Dome but does not have multiple levels and a sky walk like the Cloud Dome.

Both conservatories are cooled and eco-friendly with rainwater collected and circulated throughout.

Tip - you can buy individual tickets to each dome separately for the same price. The Cloud Forest Dome has a lot more to see and do than the Flower Dome in my opinion (including 2 excellent short films on climate change in the Cloud Dome Theatre) so if you are pressed for time I would choose Cloud Forest. Tickets are also cheaper if you book online the day before (save $5).

This was my second trip to GBTB and it was great to be back. There are some other attractions such as OCBC Skyway and Floral Fantasy that you can check out (both require tickets) or you can stroll through the outdoor section with the towering Supertree Grove ‚Äútrees‚Äù which light up at night - this is free to enter.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-22 00:16:11.451144

The gardens are peaceful and hold a lot of interesting artful sculptures and plants.
There's a small train which doesn't charge much that will take you to the domes.
The gardens themselves are even more magnificent in the dark when the neon gardens light up.
As for the domes.
The Flower Dome had a large array of beautiful rhododendrons each flower prettier than the first, (we had missed the orchids flowing season) it also had gardens based on countries, and we were amused when a tour guide explained that the maleleuca was used to make maleleuca honey. We didn't correct him.
The Cloud Dome was even better. It has a waterfall inside. Walking along a path, when you reach the top of the dome it makes you feel like you are walking in the clouds using a specialised misting machine. The effect also assists in watering the mountain off plants that grow up the man made mountain inside the dome.
If you look hard you will see several sculptures that look like they've been made from driftwood and a lion carved from a tree.

Review focuses on the Skyway & Supertree Grove

The Gardens by the Bay is Singapore at its best. The gardens come in three parts: Bay South, Bay East & Bay Central, of which Bay South is the largest (54 ha) and attracts the majority visitors ‚Äì for most, this is the park. It registered the 50th million visitor in 2018 just six years after opening. The park skirts Marina Bay on land reclaimed from the sea and exemplifies the vision of the government of the day for the development of a ‚Äòcity in a garden‚Äô ‚Äì raising the quality of urban life by emphasizing the aesthetic values that comes from access to and/or living in green space.
Walk around the park ‚Ä¶ slowly ‚Ä¶ and the visual elegance of the place comes across immediately. But there‚Äôs more beneath the galaxy of different green/floral gardens within the park - the sophistication of the conservatories (i.e. Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), fun for kids of all ages in the water-play garden and the Supertree Grove - there are the environmental messages/systems that simulate the reality of photosynthesis, water harvesting, energy capture, heat disposal and more. This is a playground with features that entertain and inform ‚Äì what you don‚Äôt see (unless you look for it) are layers beneath layers that underlie the complexity of the bioengineering required to support, nurture and sustain the botanical heritage that has been established.
Sit at a table outside the Supertree Food Hall facing the Supertree Grove (with the iconic Marine Sands Bay Building behind) and there‚Äôs this vista of green exuberance. The Supertrees are not real trees ‚Äì but tree-like structures 25-50 m high - that resemble trees in form and symmetry, and vegetation that has been established/grown to cover the underlying structure. In fact, the ‚Äòtrees‚Äô have a reinforced concrete core with external steel frame to which are attached planting panels ‚Äì that form the basis of vertical gardens. Of course you can see it‚Äôs not a real tree, but it feels like one when up close and, more so, when seen from a distance and/or when exploring the aerial walkway halfway up the trees.
It was a Sunday, and we‚Äôd taken the MRT to Marina South Pier (end of the line terminus station) that morning to explore the Singapore Maritime Gallery and, couple hours later, figured to walk through the Gardens by the Bay, the distances are comfortable on foot ‚Äì once you‚Äôre in the park ‚Äì the main challenge. We were not certain about crossing the Marina Coastal Expressway that skirts this part of the island and tends to cut the beach off from the hinterland. People whom we asked did not seem familiar with the ‚Äòwalking‚Äô aspect (and tended to discourage it ‚Äì ‚Äòtake a taxi‚Äô etc. crept into the discussion).
Well, by chance there was a 14-seater courtesy bus that ran the route on the half-hour ‚Äì nice touch, we had the bus to ourselves with a courteous driver who dropped us off just inside the park. What could have been more convenient - thanks to the friendly man at the Information Desk at Marina South Pier.
We‚Äôve been to the Gardens a number of times over the years ‚Äì always a good half-day wandering and exploring, always new things to see. Finding a convenient lunchtime coffee/snack opportunity, however, was a key priority. Lots of signposts/maps around and there‚Äôs no issue with finding your way. We crossed the Meadow heading into the centre of the park, skirted the Supertree Grove and then into the Food Hall, and out again (too noisy). Immediately outside was the caf√© that we were seeking. First impressions? Light, spacious, dominated by high pillars holding up the concrete road/footpath above, views into the Supertree Grove and, crucially, empty tables/seats ‚Äì great.
We had not originally intended to explore the OCBC Skyway, but it was there just a few metres away. Why not! Snack finished we headed off across the grove to catch the elevator that would take us up 22 m to the walkway that loops around three of the supertrees - to hang out over the edge and take time to explore the park, buildings and distant open water by eye.
Surprisingly there were relatively few people there. The kiosk is directly opposite the elevator (inside the ‚Äòtrunk‚Äô of the nearest Supertree). We paid S$8/each for our tickets and, five minutes later, we had the walkway largely to ourselves. Lots of deck space at either end of the walkway where you gain access and then, one circuit 128 m later, where you return to the ground.
In between there‚Äôs this ‚Äòin-the-sky‚Äô feel about things given the uncluttered design of the walkway, chest-high open/netted sides topped by a handrail over which you can lean, width that varies between 1.5-3 m and oval/semi-circular curve that continues to point you in a different direction as you walk. No, there‚Äôs no issue with ‚Äòheight, exposure, apprehension, etc.‚Äô you can‚Äôt for example, see through the deck beneath your feet.
That said, leaning over the rail we lost a hat to the wind - watched it float down into a flower garden at the base of one of the Supertrees ‚Äì good no one would see it there, they didn‚Äôt and 20 minutes later we rescued it.
In the distance you can see across Marina Bay towards the Bay East Gardens and, further towards the sea, there‚Äôs the Marina Barrage (where you can cross over to the other gardens). We were heading that way to visit the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (opened June 2018) and explore the development of water resources in the island.
Key/final point ‚Äì there‚Äôs no entry fee into the park ‚Äì gardens, lakes, children‚Äôs play area too, you pay for entry into the specialized features ‚Äì conservatories, aerial walkway.

They show you a documentary about climate change in the Cloud Forest, which makes you think about your own contribution to save the planet (great!) and at the same time you find a Mc Donald's (?!) in the middle of the park, a gift shop full of stuff wrapped in plastic with loads of unnecessary souvenirs and the Flower Dome is filled with christmas decorations out of plastic (artificial snow in between the flowers). It's ironic, sad, stupid and so much else... Who worked on this concept? In the end it's only about profit, entertainment and fullfilling the visitors needs to shop and make pictures. Would be so great, if they'd have taken their own concept serious and would support local businesses f.e. - keep their carbon footprint in mind. See for yourself.

This is one of the best man made horticulture places and it contains two big glass domes, one for Green vegetation and another one for flowers. Both are beautifully designed magnificently and is covering huge landscapes. The time taken to visit these two is one hour each.
Each has entrance ticket to be purcahsed. Cloud Forest.

The first one that we saw was cloud forest. At the entrance, you are greeted with a huge man made waterfall which was very beautiful. The on the stretch you could see many trees grown in a thick forest like view and there is an elevator and escalator to its 17th floor. Here, we could take a breathtaking view of the horticulture grown inside the glass dome. You could alight down a spiral road which on the way gives luxurious sceneries.

Flower dome.

Next comes the flower dome. Here the same glass dome is prevalent but this time with more natural flowers that give colour to our life. Many unknown colourful flowers greet all the way and you will definitely get tired taking photos and selfies all along. There is another area where there is a floral fantasy world setup. You could enjoy the variety of flowers decorated all along. At the end there is a small 4d show, which has swinging seats according to the motion you see on the short movie.

Don't ever miss these two attractions.

On the southern bay, there is huge tree like iron structures called super trees which is due worsted with lighting. There is a light show, every day between 7:45 to 8:45 pm and this was really wonderful to see.

Other than these there are shops as usual which depicts the beauty. One thing I would like to mention here is the practice of taking group photos by the professionals, per family and if you are interested to have them, you have to pay and these photos are mounted on a frame with beautiful backgrounds to cherish your memory later.",11-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-22 00:17:41.891099

The Flower Dome was impressive in size - a bit difficult to navigate due to the size but spend time wandering around. The Christmas decorations were out while we were there which was fun to see. They had some really cute decorations.

The skywalk was a great view - doesn't take too long to go across but can still get some great views of the supertree grove.

There are several other gardens around worth exploring that are free to enter.

I bought a deal on Klook that provided a Singapore river cruise, cloud garden, flower dome, and the skywalk for a discounted price. I would recommend trying to find this deal if you plan on going. It was very easy to exchange for tickets (show them on your phone at the Red Dot Museum).

The flower Dome was an amazing sight of colour, flowers and plants around the world- a delight to see. The domes themselves are engineered in a way that is not hindered by support piers to intrude on the visual impact of such beauty!
The second dome ‚Äò
The ‚ÄòCloud Forest‚Äô is just that a rainforest in a dome that boosts an amazing waterfall and winding path that meanders up alongside the waterfall. The waterfall surrounded by many tropical plants, way too much to do justice to the gardens.
It would be amazing to see the Gardens by the Bay at night. Indeed a speculative show. A must do for our next visit.
The Domes are air conditioned and very comfortable to spend time in. Though the gardens are free the Domes have a cost.
A train ride and commentary will assist in orienting visitors around the gardens surrounding the domes. A small cost for train is involved. If walking signs are clear and workers happy to advise.
Sculptures in the gardens are interesting and are well placed in the garden areas. A must see is the large sculpture by Marc Quinn known as the floating baby and that‚Äôs just how it looks!

We gave up and returned on Monday morning, what a difference. Plenty of space to admire the gardens and the views. The Cloud Forest takes you to a rain forest with an amazing high waterfall.

The light show starts at 7:45pm and 8:45pm if I remembered correctly. This to me is the highlight of the whole visit to the Gardens. Do bring a picnic blanket so you could spread it on the ground and lie down to fully enjoy the light show.

All in all highly recommend you guys to give Gardens by the Bay a visit.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:19:21.302624

Should have gone hours before because there is so much to see such as Cloud Forest, Flower Dome and more as well as the Supertree Grove.
The Ticket Options I found were somewhat confusing at least by the lady I spoke to at the Ticket Office. What was particularly annoying was not being able to buy a package which included the OCBC Skywalk. For that you had to go to the Supertree Grove and find the separate Booking Office as you were advised what time the next walk was available. After booking your time you then had to join the queue and wait in my case close to an hour before my time allotted became available. I simply ran out of time before the Grove closed as I didn't want to spend my time standing in a line.
Wandered around for about 20 minutes gazing at the magnificent sight of the illuminated 'trees'. I noticed a lot of people starting to lie down in various places even on the walkway not realizing that there was an evening audio/visual display about to start (hadn't seen any signs advertising it anywhere even at the entrance). Decided to join all the people and lie down gazing up at the illuminated 'trees' and to my delight the audio/visual started at about 7:45 PM after only lying there for a minute or two.
Advice: Go for perhaps 3-4 hours and see as much as you can without it becoming just a blur. Certainly Cloud Forest and Flower Dome look interesting. See if you can get onto the OCBC Skywalk in time for the audio/visual. At least make sure you are there at night for everything to be lit up.",08-2019,,2020-01-22 00:20:47.545825

Tip: One need not go up on the OCBC skyway to see the show (which anyway is tricky due to the 'timing') - honestly think the best view is from the ground!

TRAVELLERS TIP: The plants at Cloud Forest get ‚Äúwatered‚Äù through a misting system which comes at 2-hour intervals from 10 am. You may wish to visit in the evening for the best effect, as the mist will linger for a while longer in the evening when it is cooler. The water misters give the Cloud Forest more of a mystical look - it was best described in an article I read as ""a scene from Jurassic Park"".

HELPFUL INFO: The outdoor gardens - free admission (Supertree Grove, Sun Pavillion, Heritage Gardens, World of Plants and Dragonfly & Kingfisher Lakes) are open from 5 am-2 pm. The Cooled Conservatories - $28 (for two conservatories) with the peak times being from 4 pm-7 pm.

After 2 hours I had barely touched the surface of the Gardens. Surprisingly to me, a large part of the Gardens is free to view, this including the Supertrees, which are amazing in themselves, especially during the evening light and sound show. This was truely special and not to be missed.

You do pay to enter the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. That was SGD28, which I consider money well spent as I spent probably 3 hours there in total. Times that by 2, as I went again the next day as I enjoyed it so much.

The grounds are huge and many beautiful things to see. Other than hunger preventing me, I would have spent at least an hour or two more there looking around.

I recommend you go after lunch to see everything and wait until the Supertrees light show. Otherwise, go twice like I did.",10-2019,,2020-01-22 00:22:27.946690

It is well laid out, and you can take an electric buggy ride through the gardens. There are also 2 large cooled covered enclosures, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, besides the OCBC (walking) Skyway, all 3 with ticketed entry. There is also a free open air ""Sound and Light Show"" at nights. I have seen 2 special shows in the Flower Dome, the Tulips Show and the Cherry Blossom Show, which were exquisite and most colourful.

If you are a first timer like me then I would advice that you purchase the bundle package which includes Flower Doom, Cloud Forest and shuttle ride from main entrance to the two Dooms. The walk is long and the weather is hot during the day, so I would strongly recommend it. The bundle package only can be purchase at the ticket booth.

We went to the Floral Fantasy first, which is very romantic & beautiful. Especially, we loved & enjoyed the ride at the end very much.

The Flower Doom & Cloud Forest are nice too. I was amazed by the varieties of flowers & trees that they have in the doom.

We didn't get to do the supertree's skywalk because we thought it would be better to do it around the dawn instead of morning. We were planning to go back around 5pm.
However we have encountered some incidents that our schedule got delayed by couple hrs. We went back close around 8pm and the ticket was sold out, so we weren't able to go up there.

Overall, we had great time. We ended up spending more time than we originally anticipated. I would recommend place if you like flowers and plants.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-22 00:22:41.586996

If you start the visit during the day, note that the sun is so strong and as the park is very big you need to have comfortable shoes.

While I agree with recommendations to go late afternoon to catch the light show when it gets dark (7:45 pm for 1st show), make sure you provide enough daylight time if you wish to go to the two main gardens. We ended up in the floral garden and it was too dark to appreciate it as they keep the lighting quite dim. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded. It was designed to push the crowds through so it wasn't a long wait but it distracts from the nature appreciation aspects.

The most disconcerting part are the massive bottlenecks along two narrow staircase on the path to get back to the Bayside MRT Station when everyone leaves after the light show. While the crowd during my visit was relatively well disciplined, it is a disaster waiting to happen if anything unusual occurs. The massive sway in the pedestrian bridge with a huge crowd was not the most pleasant. I am surprised these were not taken into account in the design.",10-2019,,2020-01-22 00:22:54.344499

We took the Audio tour on a buggy through the gardens and this explained all of the areas, different gardens and sculptures. This is a great way to see and hear about the gardens especially as it can be so hot and walking the gardens can take a few hours. To do all of the gardens you really need most of the the day.

The Floral Fantasy does have some very exotic and interesting flowers/plants as does the Flower Dome but it‚Äôs not really worth the entrance fee.

The Cloud Forest was unfortunately closed for maintenance, we didn‚Äôt get a chance to walk around the public gardens as it was dark when the light show finished.

The light show which is formed around and onto the Super trees is a great spectacle and was by far the best thing we saw and it‚Äôs free, the show starts at 19.45 each evening and lasts for 15 minutes.

I arrived and wanted a quick tour before walking around.
There is a bus ride you can get for around 7SPD or around this price I can‚Äôt remember exactly. This was great- English speaking tour guide pointing out all of the different sections and then ending by the cloud forest so you can buy a ticket and go inside.
There is a dual ticket for all the domes which are all worth the price.
The floral fantasy is on the other side of the park, you can get a bus over or it‚Äôs about a 10 min walk from the other domes.
You can walk around the park with no charge and do not have to pay if you don‚Äôt go into the domes / skywalk etc.
You have to pay around 7/8SPD to walk on the super tree grove skywalk, this is done in time slots and can get a bit busy but the lines move quickly. If weather is stormy they will temporarily close the walk for safety- but you can simply wait for it to clear and get a later time slot. This is what I did, I just went and had some lunch while waiting.
The food there is great there are lots of choices inside the food hall right opposite the super tree grove.

The light shows in the evening are well worth the wait ! Absolutely incredible to see, get a spot early as the lawn fills up with everyone sitting down and waiting for it to start.
Times of the shows are 7.45pm / 8.45pm last around 15 mins.

Some lovely things in the gift shops.

After the light shows it gets very busy with everyone trying to leave and get taxis
Either leave a bit early or wait for the lines to clear up. I managed to book a grab taxi instead of waiting in the line for a taxi which was about a 30 min wait.",08-2019,Travelled solo,2020-01-22 00:24:15.687934

It was just a waste of time and money! There is nothing special about the attraction. It over price and similar plantation can be found in other gardens around the world.

Also, it is hard not to be cynical about the pro-environmentalist video they show at the exit from the cloud forest.

There's a 3rd, but we only wanted to do 2 of them and was told that if we only picked 2, it was these 2 that we could only do (I assume because the 3rd dome was further out). You can pick all 3 in a package which comes with a free ride on the golf buggy.
We got there nice and early on a Monday and had breakfast there, before starting out. We did Cloud Forest first and found the dome nice and quiet - only a handful of other visitors. The place is so big, you don't really get in each other's way anyway. Bear in mind that the domes are climate controlled and it was very cool in both of them. The Cloud Forest begins with a misty waterfall, before you walk around and head up to the overhead walkway. The views around the gardens and outside through the dome windows were really cool. With the 2 kids, it took us about 40 minutes to complete the dome.
Flower dome is located next to Cloud forest and when we entered about 10.30, it was very busy. The dome is broken up into different regions of the world and is very colourful, but I didn't find it as fun as I'm not a green thumb. There were plenty of colourful photo opportunities, but as it was very busy, it was a case of waiting for your turn, or waiting for the crowd to stop walking through.
The park and the domes are very wheelchair and pram friendly - we didn't have a stroller, but noticed all the ramp and elevator options.
Once we were done, we left by walking to the MRT station. It takes about 10 minutes (adult walk) and you get to walk through those gigantic trees you can see from afar.

Garden by the bay is such a wonderful place for young kids to learn and play. My 3 years old like to go there every week. Either happy hours at the water park, or appreciate the exhibition in the Dome, or just walk along the river. You can spot monitor lizard near the river.
We also likes satay by the bay which offers good food at reasonable price.

The shortfalls are Forest is not so convenient for families bringing stroller. So we usually only visit the Dome, though they are side by side.
Also there is a small water playground in between satay by the bay and marina barrage, which is great for small kids to have fun.

I suggest to be prepared to stay longer than 3 hours especially when it's crowded and if you want to take breaks, sit down in the garden, wander around. 2-3 hours to visit the domes and skywalk.

If you have a hard time walking like I did, then buy the pass that includes the shuttle (airport cart type of transit) since it's a bit of a walk to get from entrance points to the domes.",08-2019,,2020-01-22 00:25:05.381307

The gardens are open to all visitors with no fee, and then inside the gardens you have couple of places where you can enter purchasing a ticket. The open area includes sort of a theme gardens (Chinese garden, Colonial garden, etc) and the famous flower statues. There are also caffees and places to eat, and few spots perfect for the kids to play. When it comes to areas where you need to pay to access - there are two domes, one is the cloud forest with large waterfall coming from the top of the building and inside you have different gardens/exhibitions on each floor, so you take the elevator up and as you go down you stop on each floor to see something different. The other dome is gardens of the world, so vegetation, trees and plants from all around the world (Australian garden, Mediterranean garden, etc). There is also a flower garden which we didn't manage to see.
I'm pretty sure there is also a fee to go to the top of the flower statues and walk on the bridges from one to another - we did not do it since the line was horrifying, we would need to spend at least 45 min in line to enter.
Overall I enjoyed the Gardens, I think it's a place where you can easily spend all day. In my opinion it's something that families with kids would enjoy more, nonetheless it's a interesting and fun place for grownups as well.",09-2019,,2020-01-22 00:25:50.380164

As a result, we finished ‚Äúviewing‚Äù in about 30 minutes. Exiting was an issue as we could not see the sign and ended up joining the queue to the Cloud Dome. When the usher was asked, she gave the wrong instructions not meant for a wheelchair and we ended up in the souvenir shop again, looking for an exit.

For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around.

Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area previously was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time in Singapore. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture.

So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions. But, if you want to see what Singapore is truly all about, you may have to go to other locations.",09-2019,,2020-01-22 00:26:54.107302

I think the term Gardens by the Bay refers to the gardens and the tree structures but may also include the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, each housed in their own separate very large Greenhouse - I have reviewed these separately. The tree structures are very impressive in the style of something from Avatar the movie. They are much more impressive at night when they are lit up and there is a twice nightly light show set to music. It's a surreal and futuristic experience. There is a walkway between the two 'supertrees' for which there is a small charge. We found it difficult to plan ahead to do the walkway because we were given contradictory information by ticket staff which meant we made two fruitless attempts to get tickets for a specified time. Best advice is just to turn up when you want to do the walkway and wait your turn.

As a real nature lover I am very selective and critical about places that are people-made but I love the way Singapore has a way of combining man-made structures with nature.

It is a must-see for anyone visiting Singapore. Prepare to spend the entire day here and wear good walking shoes, as there is a lot to see, with both the cloud forest and the floral gardens, where it is nice and cool.

I booked a ticket for an Audio Tour, a 20-minute tram ride around the outdoors accompanied by informative audio commentary for a full cruising around. The next step is to enjoy the Flower Dome + Cloud Forest with FREE timing. The Supertrees are the first things you will notice when approaching the Gardens. Unfortunately, the OCBC Skyway was closed for maintenance. The Flower Dome was less than what I expected, I could say that the Green Planet in Dubai is far more exciting to see (although smaller) and many comments say that the Botanical gardens of Singapore are more beautiful (I will visit this week). I seem to enjoy the Cloud Forest more, I loved the waterfall, the cooling atmosphere, and being on top of the mountain. You will find SentSational Orchids (event) until 22 September in Cloud Forest, It is a small area though. I will visit the latest attraction at the gardens, Floral Fantasy this week.

Access to the outside gardens is free but it is well worth paying the entry charges for the Flowerdome and Rainforest. A trip to the top of the Rainforest with its tumbling waterfall is quite unique and breathtaking.

I didnt take the shuttle bus because i think work through the garden would be more interesting to discover. However, if you go through the garden like flower dom feel more disappointed of the place. First step in, along the first line where some flower seem dried of water. There is only one corner look perfect when you go to the end of dom garden. And what you found is a nice orchid flower there to take a picture there. I love more at forest garden.
