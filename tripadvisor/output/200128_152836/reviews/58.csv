We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we’re back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:23.987679

Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:24.245941

#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.

Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren’t even half full.

The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.

The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.

You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.

I’d also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don’t want to fatigued when visiting.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:24.527431

The park closed at midnight so we couldn’t do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don’t recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it.

There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren’t willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don’t think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times.

Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don’t mind following trails and map guides.
The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.
All the animals were out and about.
A few pacing animals which were concerning.
Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.
The disappointment was that the show’s messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!
Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!

It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat. We didn’t see the shows as we wanted to prioritise seeing the animals as the children were tired.

There is plenty to do around the night safari entrance and the restaurants were full of people waiting their turn to ride the night train around the park. We attended the 7:30 pm session and don’t know if the time made a difference to the animals and there interactions with the tour.

It was a really interesting experience going it at night time. When watching shows I recommend sitting at the back but also at the aisle to make a quick exit for the tram. It was crowded when we went and some tourists can be quite pushy. Overall good experience. Also have dinner before you go in and have it not at the zoo or just be prepared for those tourist prices.,08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:56.777518

Possible to do the safari on foot but with two tired kids, we waited almost an hour in the queue. Tip: go on the tram first and the night creature show after.
After having seen a few animal shows (birds of prey in Alsace France, China, Manila) I wasn’t impressed. It’s a very simple show but I won’t spoil the surprise.
The actual safari takes about 35 mins, there’s no wow factor. Getting to the zoo from downtown then queuing for so long zapped my energy. However for kids it’s ok. The souvenir shop is totally generic (I already had a few of the items). SG is expensive so the tickets were also expensive. There’s a short fire show that’s impressive just after the entrance.
Hope you will have a better time than we did. Regarding transport we took a grab to east park and it was 30$ vs the transport offered at 50$",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:57.058131

Staff in the night safari are for the most part grumpy, rude and combative. Could be a result of the kind of tourist they encounter BUT that's no excuse.

It's actually harder to spot animals compared to during the day if you see them at all and because of the lighting it's hards to see them even if you do.

Its in my opinion really overated and not worth going. I can't recommend visiting.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:57.386869

Our son (4yrs) loves animals so we thought this would be a great family experience. We didnt buy tickets in advance which was a mistake, if you do go buy the tickets online, you will save yourself so much time and avoid the chaos.
Our son was excited all the way through the queue until he saw that the tram goes in the dark and he has a complete panic attack, refusing to sit on the tram. The park staff took us off and told us they would put us on the next one once my son had calmed down. But he still wouldn't. But one on the park employees - Damion was amazing, we are so grateful for how he helped us to try and calm down our son, and how he and all the other lovely employees really wanted our family to enjoy this experience.
They arranged for our family to have a private buggy, so our son wasn't overwhelmed by all the people on the tram and got to see all the animals he loves and we got to have a really cool experience! Especially seeing the elephants. They even arranged front row seats at the show, but our son was too tired by this point to cope sitting through a show.
We have so much gratitude for Damion, Femi, and the other staff who went above and beyond normal customer service. Their care and patients created a beautiful family experience for us that we will always remember. To put it in the word of my 4yr old, that was so awesome...let's go again.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:57.926571

Because of the haze in Malaysia and Singapore schools have been closed at various times over the last few weeks. As a result of this one of our children’s exam revision classes have been moved and clash with our proposed trip to the Night Safari. I spoke with Wildlife Reserves Singapore whose staff said that due to the exceptional circumstances it was happy for us to change our dates but that we had to do so via our agent Viator. Despite giving Viator the full facts, its staff said no!!!

The lesson from this is that just because Viator is a Trip Adviser Company, it does not prioritize its customers needs. It appears to be interested in nothing other than its booking fees, certainly not customer service! It is strange that when one searches for Singapore Night Safari on the Internet, Viator comes up first not WRS! With hindsight I should have booked directly with Wildlife Reserves Singapore rather than through Viator. I certainly would never use Viator again.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:58.194706

Well, night safari is not the right place to do that. At the entrace, we were greeted by lines of gift shops, and then restaurants (is this a mall or something?)
Then there’s this queue for the tram ride. We didn’t queue for a long time since I’ve read the review and so we arrived there 6.45pm (on Friday).
The tram ride is so so.. I feel like duration is too short, too many deer-like animals (my kids even said “why are we seeing deers again?”) and the tram’s length itself is too long so that the passangers at the rear end couldn’t even see anything!
After the tram ride ended, we went to see the night show.... which was also so so. Nothing impressing, animals appeared less than a minute (like they’re in rush or something). Owls appeared just once.... sorry, but super boring.
And that’s it. For 46SGD, tbh it’s not worth it. Our journey ended with the night shows, unless you want to walk the trail (in the middle of the night with very small chances to see anything) - no thanks. Better to do something else , just go to river safari or singapore zoo instead.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:29:59.015688
