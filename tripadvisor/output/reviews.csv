,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/AirFuss,739359655,Today,5,Beautiful and well maintained,"We have been here two times. The flower dome is beautiful and colorful especially with different theme each time.

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The best part for kids is the children’s gardens where they can play with water in small fountains. Kids will enjoy to their fullest here.",September 2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-16 11:46:01.982204
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/IanK2174,739332599,Today,4,A lit up night,"The light show was excellent, they have a few at separate times, we did the 7.45pm show.
A lot of people but the taxis & the buses were well organised in shambolic traffic so arriving and leaving was fine, take a cab if you can or go with an organised tour.
To me the highlights were the visit to the two domes, you had to pay an entrance fee but they were excellent.",January 2020,,2020-01-16 11:46:02.453262
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/danae_mily,739323402,Today,5,Simply amazing,"We enjoyed it so much. You can visit them just to make a walk and enjoy the fantastic show with the trees ( at 19:45 & 20:45 every day) which is free of charge. Instead, along with the walk you can visit a variety of sightseeing such as the CLoud Forest , the Flower Dome and the OCBC Skywalk.",January 2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-16 11:46:02.768167
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/minnesotans4,739268448,Today,5,Unbelievably beautiful!,"Few people can adequately describe the stunning beauty of the Gardens by the Bay and I am certainly not one of them just know it is a must see. We purchased the garden tour package which included admissions to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and a 20 minute audio tour on a tram going by the art sculptures, Supertree grove, and outdoor gardens.
The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, “it replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world”. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.
The Cloud Forest displayed the “cool moist climate of the tropical highlands of Southeast Asia, tropical America and Africa. The 35 foot cascading waterfall with plants on the wall was breathtaking.",December 2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-16 11:46:03.080023
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Kevin_Mumbai,739232013,Today,5,Definitely worth every penny,"Was a beautiful experience overall and a perfect place for a family visit. The flower dome, cloud forest, the far east kids playground, the supertrees and the rest of the gardens are a must-do while in Singapore. Save a full day to experience the whole area if travelling with kids. Perfect spot for some memorable photographs.",January 2020,Travelled with family,2020-01-16 11:46:03.409640
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/richardhayes2,739231483,Yesterday,5,New Year Holiday,What a fantastic free attraction. The Gardens By The Bay are probably the best gardens that we have visited in the world and are free to walk around. The Sky walk was excellent value for money. At night the light displays are out of this world. A short walk back to the marina on new years eve and we were treated to a fantastic firework display that seemed to go on forever (from 21:30hrs to 00:20hrs and all free to view.,December 2019,,2020-01-16 11:46:06.404630

I did the Floral Fantasy and Dome and enjoyed it thoroughly. I had heard of this garden and seen pictures but it was better than I had expected,January 2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-16 11:46:06.709587
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JoeGoGoGo,739223479,14 Jan,3,Don’t bother with a ticket.,"It’s a delightful place, but all the best bits are free.
The Sky Walk is pretty short, crowded and no big deal.
The temperate (?) flower dome is full of daft lego exhibits.",January 2020,,2020-01-16 11:46:07.039416
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/paulchickensoup,739217417,14 Jan,4,Must Visit,"Inspiring! With the supertree grove in particular, stunning garden with loss to check out. Great establishment with restaurants, downside is that different attraction got its individual ticketing. Waste quite a lot of time just to line up.",January 2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-16 11:46:07.348408
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/MinnFamily070,739216041,14 Jan,5,What a Beautiful Park,"This place was absolutely amazing , what a treat. We arrived at 4pm and walked around took pictures then we got dinner. After dinner walked over to Sands Skypark Observation Deck which is 52 floors up. The view of the park looking down was so cool.

Then when it became dark all the lights came on!! It is difficult to describe how beautiful it looked. This is something you need to see if you are visiting Singapore.",January 2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-16 11:46:07.677165
,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/andy19283,739354755,Today,4,All the hype!,"I went up to the bar at the sky park and what a view. The skies were a little cloudy hence not a clear vision. But I enjoyed a cocktail and relaxed during sunset. Lovely hotel but lots of people.
Best to visit during early hours. There is a shopping mall at the hotel and many eateries as well.",January 2020,,2020-01-16 11:46:18.098911
,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Serial_Traveller,739270354,Today,3,There's Far More Impressive Skylines,"The creator of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark was smart. It was a license to print money. Of course, you're in Singapore, you have to go. But the Singapore skyline is not very impressive. It sure isn't New York, London, Tokyo, Bangkok or many others. It's a pretty small skyline. And as for the lightshow. That's incredibly weak. Not a patch on the one at the Bellagio, Las Vegas, or the one by The Address in Dubai. Singapore really needs to try better.",January 2020,,2020-01-16 11:46:18.451783

,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/shaniPiccolotti,739134647,Yesterday,4,Amazing Pool,"You honestly stay here for the Pool. The hotel room was really basic for how much it costs to stay here. Nothing special, very basic and clean but not worth the price tag. The food, shops, and the service are amazing. There's a lot to do at all times either shopping, eating, dancing etc but the pool is where its at. The view, the food and drink was just amazing. It could have been a little warmer, the water is freezing but it was worth it to stay for one night.",December 2019,,2020-01-16 11:46:19.280150

Great view, especially at night, but not really worth the fee or the crowd. Getting up was easy but had to wait in line 20mins for an elevator down.",January 2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-16 11:46:22.872970
,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/xAZAMBx,738977553,13 Jan,3,Spoilt by inconsiderate campers!,"The view was nice and you could see a big part of singapore and (especially) gardens by the bay area. However, there were many people sitting down right beside the glass viewing ares and sits there for HOURS just to wait for the Supergrove light show at 8pm. Because of this, it is really hard to get a closer view of the city since space taken up by these INCONSIDERATE PEOPLE!. There is a restaurant above as well, however only open to hotel guests. The small beverage stand had very little variety of drinks and serves no food. And charges MIND BENDING prices for Tiger Beer (which is a horrible beer i might add). And in case youre wondering....no the pool is not accessible by non-hotel guests.",December 2019,,2020-01-16 11:46:23.192327
