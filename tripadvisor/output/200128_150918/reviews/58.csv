Had to get there by metro and shuttle bus and managedto get last shuttle bus and,Reallly worthwhile trip from hotel via metro and shuttle bus. Caught the tram ride around the site followed by 10.30pm creature show which was great. Managed to get last shuttle bus and last metro then taxi back to hotel. Thoroughly enjoyable but the Rainforest Lumina was disappointing.,01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:37.910975

We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we’re back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:38.462998

Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:38.715829

#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.

Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren’t even half full.

The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.

The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.

You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.

I’d also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don’t want to fatigued when visiting.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:39.003984

Used the food court before going in which was good value and tasty. The land train around the zoo was great and saw most of the animals. This lasted about 30 minutes. Then walking around the zoo and having time to properly see the animals was great. At times a little freaky when hyenas disappear into the shadows not that far from you. Couldn't get into the creatures show as always fully booked and wasn't wasting 45 minutes queuing for it. We'll worth it.,12-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:39.273221

Lots of encounters and close ups with the animals. Amazing dining places and an excellent show called Creatures of the night which is a must watch. Night safari is one of the top best attractions in Singapore and is a must visit with friends family etc.,01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:39.518458

Naively I thought, oh with pre-determined times there must not be a lot of people. Wrong! The queue to the tram was huge. The tour is nice, well put and designed. They do a good job ensuring the animals are visible. There are 2 beginning trails - fishing cat or wallaby. From there you can decide to continue onto other trails or return. The park closed at midnight so we couldn’t do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don’t recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it. I wish the trams stopped more so we could take decent pictures. All in all, ok activity to do with the children but make sure you plan it well.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:39.774766

There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren’t willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don’t think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times. There are still people there from the earlier entrance time.
Great place to see some animals and lots of people queuing.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:40.030994

Oh yea, you might be able to see 1 tiger, 1 lion, rhinoceros, and a school of flamingos. That's all!
I would rather pay a visit to the zoo in the opposite during the day time instead in the future, if I visit Singapore again, at least I can see more animals clearly, instead of spotting only few animals in dark.
Totally not worthy and not recommended.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:46.332779

Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don’t mind following trails and map guides.
The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.
All the animals were out and about.
A few pacing animals which were concerning.
Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.
The disappointment was that the show’s messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!
Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!

Super long queues for taxis at the end of the night. We waited 40 mins for a taxi! If you have grab app or can order a taxi before the last show ends, do it!",12-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:46.581186

Then get into the line for tram. Tram ride is for 45min. Then go for fishing cat trail walk (do not miss it) will see there pangolin, Armadillo, clouded Leopard etc.
If you want you may spend the whole day by going to zoo during the day and night safari in the evening.

Overall good experience. You are out around 10am. Board the bus to reach your hotel or nearest point to your stay, it will be difficult to get a taxi.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:09:47.375271
