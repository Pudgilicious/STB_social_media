You can reach there easily by public transport (subway, buses...).

The historical significance emerges as you pass the cannon and figurines of soldiers with their artillery as it was in the defence of the island against theJapanese in the Pacific War. There's even a tunnel where artillery was stored..
Further up it's the waterfront where you can see boats, container ships and the cable cars above. Unfortunately there are picnic grounds with barbecue pots resembling East Coast Park which mar the natural surroundings. Hopefully the groups which make use of them clear their refuse as we could see large numbers of plastic wrappers, bottles etc floating in the sea at the breakwater near where people were fishing (thought this wasn't allowed?)
The boardwalk was good, passing a green mangrove pool, very picturesque, and delightfully, we saw a monitor lizard in the leaf litter, four monkeys on the rail of the boardwalk and a family of hens and chickens, a couple of squirrels.
You can exit at the other gate of the Labrador mrt station and walk across to the PSA building for lunch..
It's a one hour walk in the park, not counting time spent on the Mrt and walking to the PSA building. Not as challenging and interesting as the Southern Ridges as it's a shorter walk, less steep but noisier with visitors and their food and hilarity.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-31 17:22:57.480694

Singapore.
“Built on the edge of the secondary forest with a prime vantage point of the cliff-side vegetation and a picturesque view of the sea, Labrador Nature Reserve is an oasis of tranquility and natural wonders. Thriving with wildlife, the park is a favorite haunt of nature lovers.”
That was the Singapore Parks Authorities’ somewhat exaggerated version of what Labrador Park is today. Vegetation has covered all of the escarpment and the density prevents any reasonable view of the park and the beach below. As for the ‘thriving wildlife’ no animals bigger than a squirrel can be seen except a resident peacock and some jungle fowls loitering around near the creek area.
The Labrador Park I knew when I was young was a rocky beach at the foot of cliffs, that was some parts cover with coarse vegetation and some parts bare, with a narrow rocky path. We would navigate the path down to the beach to swim. It was crowded during the weekends, only with locals, mainly youths. Reclamation had erased what little beach there was and you can’t swim there anymore.
Today Labrador has been transformed into a busy recreation ground where tourists came to view the war remains of British War embankments and a sixteen inch gun and to learn of the history on how the guns were facing the wrong direction when the Japanese invaders came during the WW2. A guide would take the tourist down the to the sea side where one end of the esplanade is long jetty with a history of it being used by a Japanese Oil Refinery to convey its products to small tankers. At the other end the tourist would come across a pill box preserved as a reminder of a beach machine gun defense post standing next to an obelisk. No sign of explanation of what the object was doing there, can be found. As the tourists venture further they would come across a strange looking rock that has a history of a meeting point for pirates coming to shore. Though it doesn’t has any resemblance to a dragon it has an imaginary name ‘Dragon’s Teeth Gate’. There used to be a small cave somewhere along the cliff, but there is none to be seen.
The mouth of the creek is where the people usually end their walks, however there is an extension by way of a board walk. Berlayer creek used to be a muddy clogged up stream. It is now a beautiful rivulet that is pleasant to walk along to the MRT station at the main road. Bukit Chermin Boardwalk is best for evening and morning walks when the sun is not so strong. Great sunset can be seen along the boardwalk as you stroll along the mangrove, and one can gaze at the ferries coming into port from Batam. At the farthest point out to sea the Red Beacon stands, to warn ships from the rocky shore.
Labrador is not a large park by Singapore standards but its amenities far out shines other bigger parks. One plus factor are the clean washrooms which are well placed throughout. There is a campsite, BBQ pits, Children’s playground, exercise areas, drinks fountains, drinks machines, benches (are everywhere) and designated areas where the angler can pitch his rod.
In my younger days, buses were infrequent and we used to walk uphill to Labrador Villa Road then down a cliff path to the beach. Now there is a Labrador Station MRT with many buses stopping alongside, and all you need is a pleasant walk along the Berlayer Creek. Cars go right up to the park using Port Road which runs alongside Berlayer Creek and Labrador Villa Road. At the end of Labrador Villa Road a holiday hostel for nurses, used to stand. Now in its place is a restored 1920 colonial garrison that has been taken over by Villa Samadhi Hotel with its popular in-house restaurant Tamarind Hill. After a hot day in the sun at the park it is refreshing to chill out and have tea at Tamarind Hill Restaurant.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-31 17:22:58.986515

The drive in to the most distant car park (C) is spookily quiet, but once at C, there was lighting and a well constructed footpath. At the starting point, the lights of the Pasir Panjang port shimmer across the water, and the continuous rumble of machinery reminds you that you are still in the city. The path took us around the Dragon's Teeth gate, and meandered along the coastline to the Bukit Chermin boardwalk. There is a branch along the Berlayer Creek walk which leads to the Labrador Park MRT, but we didn't take this. There are some tranquil views along the way of Keppel Island and Sentosa Island, but you are constantly aware that you are still in the heart of one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Turning westward from the carpark, you stroll along a parklike stretch of greenery, complete with roosters, hens and a solitary peacock. Access to the gun batteries is from Car park A; we didn't have time for that this time, but will return to explore that side of the park.

Thriving with wildlife, the park is a favourite haunt of nature lovers. I could hear songs from a variety of bird species, including those of the Oriental Magpie-robin and Black-naped Oriole. Took a leisurely stroll through the Berlayer creek mangrove trail and reached the coastal cliff.

The Berlayer Creek mangrove trail is 960m long and is one of the few remaining mangrove areas in the city area which is home to back mangrove species, as well as a myriad of fauna and flora, including one of the highest densities of molluscs in Singapore.

The coastal area is the most developed part of Labrador Park and this paved pedestrian path runs along the water. This is where I saw a few visitors can be found make in the children’s playground, scenic jogging trails and barbecue pits. There’s also an elevated boardwalk over the water where I spotted mudskippers, sea grasses and small crabs.
If the Berlayer Creek was all about mangroves, then the 330m Bukit Chermin Boardwalk was where we got close to the sea.

Behind the developed coastal area is the jungle. This is where Labrador Park feels a world away from urban Singapore. The trees covered with vines were so dense they practically blocked out the sun . The limited network of trails were paved and had stairs and hand railings where necessary, making Labrador Park one of Singapore’s easiest nature reserves for walking. The park is home to more than 70 species of birds including wild parrots and bright yellow orioles.

Amid the jungle I saw some moss-covered remains from World War II including bunkers and gun batteries. The area that is now Labrador Nature Reserve was once Fort Pasir Panjang, one of the military forts built by the British to protect the port of Singapore. Informational signs dispel common myths like that Singapore lost to the Japanese invaders because the guns at these coastal forts were pointed facing the wrong direction (in fact, they could rotate 360-degrees but were not placed for firing inland and had the wrong kind of ammo).

Combining forest trails rich in birdlife and a beachfront park, Labrador Park is scattered with evocative British war relics, only rediscovered in the 1980s. The reserve’s hilly terrain sweeps down to the shore, where expansive lawn, shade and the sound of lapping waves invited a lazy picnic.

Labrador Nature Reserve is part of the Southern Ridges, which also comprises Mount Faber Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park, and Kent Ridge Park.
To Reach: Take the MRT to Labrador Park and you will find the entrance right next to the exit. There are no admission charges. Remember to take your water bottles, there are no water stations here.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:23:09.504082

Visitors to the park will enjoy the peacefulness of its surroundings, water views (with the port on the opposite), and even a little bit of Singapore's history. An old fort used by the resistance force in defending the southern shore of Singapore against enemy attacks during the Second World War still stands close to the water.

This will take you soon beside a very unique architecture, the Reflections condominium...and if you have the energy you could even cross the bridge after reaching the end of the marina to go to Keppel Island, where you could walk around the island.

This is a favorite place to go for family, couples and friends to hang out in the weekend.
It was kind of crowded when we were there.
The view is lovely, one can get to see the new cargo port and Jurong Island at the West and on the East, one can see the Iconic condo Reflection, Keppel Bay and Harbour Front. And right at the front the Sentosa Island can view from afar.
Apart from this view, for the history buff, you can get to learn a bit more of the Singapore history here, such as viewing the replica of Dragon Teeth Gate, or Lot's Wife as called by some. (Original was blow up by the British in 1848 to widen the channel. Damn you, British!), the story of the British war with the Pirates (yes, there were pirates then) and the machine gun fort that still stood at site.
With the sea breeze and the sun setting over the horizon.

There are a couple of highlights (e.g. Dragon’s Teeth Gate replica) but the favourite for me was to walk up through the old fort Pasir Panjang brick wall entrance on a wide easy road to the 6in gun and other battery positions. The gun was originally installed around the 1890s (found I think in 2001), but this whole section was of course a key position for WW2.

I didn't know to expect the military history. Pillboxes still in situ and battery guns along with children's playgrounds. This really brought Singapore's past to life for me. There are paths along the beach, but also through the forest along the ridge.

It is possible to make a circuit through the Nature Reserve and return to the MRT by backtracking the same road as when arriving. But, I choose to follow the path along Berlayer Creek, a wise choice, I think. This is a mangrove area with very interesting wildlife. This trail also returns you to the Labrador Park MRT.
