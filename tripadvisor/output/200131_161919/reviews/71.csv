Interesting gargoyles decorate the outer facade of the building, while the surrounding grounds below resembles Venice's San Marco's Square. One could easily forget that they are in the midst of a busy city when strolling through the open grounds below. It is not a retail mall though, but an office building. Not a usual tourist spot, but you could pass by it if you are walking towards DUO or Haji Lane. Worth taking a look if only to marvel at the building and the many interesting sculptures and statues dotting the ground.

We went on a fabulous walking tour (Indie Singapore tours) and our fantastic guide Wei stopped to show us this Art Deco gem of a building. It's hard to believe that it was built in 2000! The lobby area is open to the public, but as the building houses three embassies, there is a security presence. The lobby area has the most fantastic bar with a 4 storey high wine cabinet. The only way to get the wine down is by way of a silver wine fairy (the waitress is dressed as a silver fairy and uses a pulley to get around the cabinet -one must see it to believe it!).

We got off the subway to go to Little India and saw this amazing building about a block away. It was a Saturday, and the area was totally deserted. If you have money and want to spend it ostentatiously and you love Art Deco, this is what you do. What an indulgence! From the exterior gates to the amazing forecourt, which I later read was fashioned after the Piazza San Marco in Venice, with bronze statues of famous historical figures and a golden crane that faces mainland China, the owner's homeland. There is not a nook or cranny that isn't decorated with precision style. Gargoyles, fountains, you name it. The office building appeared off-limits, but the guard let us in for a few moments to look at the lobby. Again, all you can do is gape in amazement at what went into this creation. We were too early to see the ""wine fairy"" (check out YouTube...) retrieve wine from the two story wine rack, but we could still admire the extraordinary effort put into decorating this building. In my later reading, it said that it is one of the most expensive office buildings in Singapore (and that's saying something), with several consulates, and office space with no pillars so tenants can design the space as they like. It was only just built in 2002, but what a tribute to the Art Deco style. If you are wandering around Singapore, take a look.

Inside the main courtyard were a number of unusual statues that ranged from massive in size to whimsical. Palm trees provided welcoming shade from the hot sun while lots of greenery and a waterfall made this a nice spot to relax.

Walking into the building, I came face to face with the over the top Divine Wine Bar with its gilded ceiling and walls, huge murals and the wine storage that rose all the way to the ceiling.

There is a small museum on the third floor of Parkview. It is more like a gallery yet it is worthwhile for visiting. The paintings and artworks there are creative. I especially like the Aldo Mondino painting which really can bring out the Turkish dancing motion and act like the music is on.

We were unaware of the 'sharks and humanity' exhibition and after admiring the exterior statues and crane the mesh shark fin didn't give us any idea of what was in store for us on the upper floor.
The ground floor is truly a blast from the past, but being late morning we didn't see the wine fairy. The staff didn't mind us wandering around admiring and photographing the interior. A visit to the ladies cloakroom was a revelation - heated loo seats!!
The exhibition was in several rooms,each shark [probably 1/4 size?] was depicted in different materials: metals, acrylics and like a helium balloons looking as if swimming, either suspended on steel ropes or supported on a couple of poles.
Fortunate that this special exhibition coincided with our tine in Singapore. Park View Square is definitely somewhere I would visit again when next in Singapore,",03-2017,Friends,2020-01-31 16:25:49.883036

You will definitely need your camera as you will be taking photos inside and out (day time). The wine fairy is great to see too!

And there it was, Parkview. My age-old gripe is that buildings these days (in the UK at least) are built to last 30 years. I disagreed with m friend - I didn't see it as over-the-top, but a fabulous building which makes a huge statement. You can read its history elsewhere, but I would say without hesitation that it's worth a short MRT or bus ride. The building is a recreation of one in New York, but there is fantastic design and detail both inside and out (although sadly the inside was being renovated when we visited, so I missed the flying fairy retrieving wine from the 30m rack. Maybe that would have been over-the-top!). Go and be glad that someone cared enough to make something beautiful.",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:25:56.237000

This place is just gorgeous. It's actually a hotel lobby, but it's so incredibly decorous besides that that it's definitely worth visiting.",08-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:25:56.589918

I believe the locals call it the Batman Building because it looks like it belongs in Gotham City, it is a lovely building, with a very nice bar that takes up the majority of the lobby; with a piano player and singer on the mezzanine it felt more like a cool hotel lobby than that of an office building. You don't have to wait long for the Wine Angel to fly up the vertical cellar and retrieve a bottle of wine, I think people order a bottle of wine just for the theatrics.
I also had the best Singapore Sling at this bar.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:25:56.955350
