Sure, the young kids weren't so fascinated with the teeny weeny details as would an all-out adult nerd. That's where the other exhibits such as the dinosaur skeletons, life-sized crocodiles, bears etc come into place to keep them entertained. It would be great if you could catch some of the activities such as terrarium building, that would involve the kids more and groom them to be nature observers and lovers too!

Established only in April 2015, so its fairly new actually. You can get the tickets from the ticketing counter near the entrance.

It is small, don't expect a huge museum like you would see in other countries, but you get a really extensive display of national history specimens in Southeast Asia. I was initially worried that the size of the museum wouldn't keep me and my son long, but because it was so interesting, we spent 1.5 hours in the museum. We would probably have stayed longer if we didn't have another appointment to go to.

Although its school holidays in Singapore, there isn't really a crowd when we visited, giving us the opportunity to take our time exploring each zone and reading through most of the exhibits. The ability for him to see dinosaurs fossils rather than watching them in movies was much more worth it I feel, and he truly enjoyed the visit too.

Took my young kids to this museum, there were many informative displays and things to touch and see. We taught them that if humans do not take care of the earth and animals, this is probably where the future will ever get to know about animals.

The dinosaur fossils were the highlight of coz, so was the sperm whale bones on display. We used it as an educational tour for our kids to teach them about conserving the planet.

What we like:
- Collection and space is relatively small as compared to other natural history museums
- The location is not exactly accessible or convenient

What we did not like:
- Visited a number of natural history museums in the world and this by far, is the most disappointing as the items did not feel like they were carefully curated. Yes, they had an impressive collection but it was more of 'I have so much items, what do I do with it? Oh let's open a museum'.

We spent a good 3 hours there (and I had to hurry my children along). The 2nd floor were mostly taxidermy animals (not sure if that's what I should be calling mummified animals) accompanied with history of the museum and the must-watch video of the process of preserving the skeleton of the sperm whale that was discovered dead on the beach of Singapore along with other exhibits and awareness of how pollution is affecting our environment.

The floor area is small, and can be covered in under 3 hours. It definitely cannot be compared with the other natural history museums in other parts of the world.

However, what impressed me was the showcase of biodiversity in South East Asia (or in Singapore) that was captured by this museum. It's a good platform for our young to first learn about the animals and environment, esp for 9-10 year old who are first learning about science. There are quite a lot to see, from taxidermied mammals to fishes to whale bones to dinosaur bones to fungi to butterflies & insects to sea creatures like turtles... the list goes on.

Other than that this museum is not worth visiting because it is one of the most boring natural history museums I have ever been to. There is virtually nothing for kids (who love dinosaurs). The so-called ""interactive"" displays are basically grad students and professors from China droning on and on about ecological concepts that would bore a fourth year undergrad.

The top floor has information of Singapore's biodiversity which is basically confined to static displays of bird and insect carcasses. No attempt is made to present this information in an engaging or interesting manner. The stuffed tiger looks old and mouldy, and the whole museum is basically one large exercise in disappointment.

My dad and I went in with a question, ""who would be the museum's target audience?"" We came out asking the same question.

That much work went into making the museum exhibits reality cannot be denied... The gallery is quite professionally designed, and they manage to include everything from microbes to mushrooms to plants and animals within a relatively small space.

I have a soft spot for the herbarium corner, having spent some of my happiest student days in herbariums (plant libraries). I liked how the liverworts and mosses were presented, it was like having a look at nature. It was also a pleasant surprise to see the bed frame from Lucy Davis' Migrant Ecologies.

Having said that, I was surprised that the exhibits space seem much smaller than the size of the building. The style of presentation is quite predictable. After a while, the animal specimens took a toll on me, and I simply couldn't look beyond a few seconds at the mammal and bird exhibits.

There were some nice animations, but it takes a while to figure out what they were trying to say. There was an animation of how the world's land masses will be millions of years into the future. It reminded me that humans' time on Earth is really so minuscule, and all the country borders etc simply don't make sense when one looks millions of years into the future.

What I think the museum needs - more intuitive exhibits that are immersive and/or engaging. Since visitors are allocated timings for visits, perhaps each visitor group could have a guided tour? Or at least some volunteers ready to engage.

My recent memories of the National Museum and Science Centre exhibits are, ""that's so amazing, I can't wait to be back!!!"" I hope that my next LCK natural history museum visit will be just as amazing, if not better.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:07:15.076181

,1,77,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/gumbokins,379801330,05-06-2016,4,The Wonderful World of Biodiversity,"I visited the original museum at NUS as an educator...it was a small, run down musty room packed to the brim with collections and specimens. I later learnt that the bulk of their collection was in storage, away from public viewing and thought it was such a pity that such a monumental collection of Singapore's natural history would not be seen by many.

The Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum is located deep in Clementi, making it a little far off for the average visitor. There are no other real places of interest nearby. You could spend maybe 3 hours here (that includes following a guided tour). There also isn't anywhere to eat, the gift shop sells some snacks and instant cup noodles to stave off the hunger pangs.Perhaps if you visited on a weekday, you could wander around the university campus and look for cheap eats at the many campus canteens but we were there on a Saturday and things were pretty quiet.

As far as museums go, the LCHNHM is beautiful. The specimens and models are displayed beautifully, and it's great to see all the weird and wonderful creatures. The 3 sauropods are certainly something to behold but yet, somehow, pale in comparison to the other specimens (foreign import vs local biodiversity heehee). The museum is spacious and the collection is interesting. Singapore is richly biodiverse, after all it was in this region that Albert Wallace came up with the theory of evolution through his extensive study of the local flora and fauna. Unfortunately, in the name of progress, many Singaporeans don't know/don't care about this.

Tickets can (only?) be bought online, they impose timed entry to manage the crowd but there were maybe 50 people there when we visited on a Saturday afternoon so I'm not sure what is considered peak. A little steep, considering but if you love natural history museums, this should be quite high up on your list of things to do.

We would have loved something interactive for the younger children to do; an activity booklet with kid sized info, a colouring station etc

It was just a short visit for the kids to show them the 3 dinosaur fossils. Boy, was I wrong. The place is packed with so much information, especially the diverse collection of local flora and fauna; and some only found in Southeast Asia, and probably none as well documented as here.

This is not a large museum but it does have some interesting exhibits. While the exhibits are very neat, well labelled and has clear notations, the museum is very much designed like a textbook - informative but sterile. But with the commentary provided by our guide, the exhibits became far more interesting as the guide brought up funny and unique characteristics of the various organisms, places in Singapore where certain species can be found, anecdotes and personal experiences when dealing with specimens etc.

It is a great place to spend some time with the kids, but it does take a little effort to keep the kids interested after the first 5 minutes of staring at the dinosaur bones in the center of the room.

The exhibits on the first floor are arranged in a way to communicate the narrative of how nature around us developed. It tries to serve as a scientific story about the world, as opposed to fables and myths. Some of the sections have a screen where you can watch biologists talk about their research specific to a specie. I particularly liked this because it was a nice little tribute to the scientists who have dedicated their lives to studying nature. Also, it adds a little bit of that personal touch if reading the numerous descriptions get a tad tiring. Particularly enjoyed the tropical forest section where they had videos explaining 'flying' animals.

Impossible to miss are the two dinosaur exhibits near the start of the exhibits. I think the museum conducts dinosaur light shows almost every half hour, so the museum is punctuated with dino roars periodically. When the shows aren't on, the museum plays an ambient forest noise which enhances the experience.

I enjoyed the Singapore-specific second floor the most. This section has exhibits and stories about pre-colonial and post-colonial natural history of this tropical island's rich biodiversity.

The upstairs section with cabinets reminiscent of the old Raffles Museum (now the National Museum of Singapore) told the story of early naturalists perfectly. A field shirt, a pair of binos and an old hasselblad on a chair and a case of stuffed bird specimens.

The museum is laid out very well, beginning with well... the beginning of nature. And ending at the top floor with highlighting the important natural historians and biologists such as Charles Darwin, Sir Stamford Raffles and Alfred R. Wallace.

Some of the highlights of the museum were the whale skeleton which was found off the shores of Singapore, the taxidermy mammals and the large collection of marine invertebrates (shells of all kinds, crabs, clams). Don't forget to check out the outdoor garden where various mangroves and plants are situated for the public to view as examples. The giant dinosaur skeletons were also a great touch to the overall experience. Whilst there, I also got to see the exhibition on the whale carcass excavation that took place in Singapore. If you're a student, bring your student card (international also accepted) and get a discount on ticket prices.

The museum takes approx 2-3 hours to walk through (considering you read nearly everything).

The fossil collections are cool too, e.g., Ammonites, Coelacanth, Lungfish, and... too many to mention. This is a must-visit for people who are interested in biology, paleontology, and just animals and plants in general. Quite a worthwhile visit even though it is a bit far from the nearest MRT station (Clementi). Will definitely go again here someday.

To get here:

1. Take an MRT, Get off Clementi Station, and go to the Bus Interchange inside Clementi Mall.

2. Take the bus number 96. The waiting time is 5-10 minutes (On a Tuesday morning).

3. Get off at the bus stop 16169, that is Kent Ridge Crescent facing the NUS Museum (I think this is the bus' last stop). From there you can already see the LKCNH Museum building just beside the NUS Museum, then just walk over there.

Some Tips:
1. If you are a non-Singaporean, buy the tickets on klook.com because it's much cheaper there.
2. Tickets are via reservation only. You can't just walk in there to buy.

The exterior of the building was impressive and the media hype surrounding this museum when it first opened gave me a certain high expectation.
LKCNHM pales in comparison with Smithsonian Museum, British Natural History Museum or Vienna's Natural History Museum - these are really world class but It would be unfair to compare.
But the small size is not the factor for my low rating. The educational objective is what really matters - who is the target audience, what education level & what level of knowledge to impart. Currently it's neither here nor there.
I mean, this museum is probably good for local visitors or a local school's field trip. If I were a foreign tourist, I would feel this was a great waste of my precious time.
The 3 dinosaur fossils, acquired at a substantial cost, were too lightly treated or dumbed down. More information could be shared around the exhibit - their life, diet, predator, locomotion etc. Berlin Natural History Museum did a good job with their fossil of a T-Rex. Oh, one more thing, the dinosaurs 'light show' was a total farce. As one of the world's top universities, NUS could surely do better.
Similarly the sperm whale skeleton is accompanied with barely there information about these magnificent mammals - how & what they feed on, their reproduction, how human impact their population, how whalers exploit them etc.
On the positive side, I applaud LKCNHM's effort to focus on Singapore and regional biodiversity. There is relevance in the way of story telling in order to impart knowledge or to pique curiosity. The small Heritage Gallery featuring collections from the original Raffles Museum is nicely presented.

Inside this building, there is a huge load of information but this small natural museum tries too much to show a lot of species of the biodiversity in this region. The new exhibits and the rows and rows of specimens, nicely arranged and/or in their preservation bottles, felt, well, very clinical.
Only a true blooded naturalist or those scientifically inclined, would enjoy a few hours in this museum.
The star of the museum is the 3 dinosaur skeletons that the museum had purchased. Though magnificent, I failed to see the relevance of the dinosaur bones to this museum as huge dinosaurs like these were probably not in this region during the age of the dinosaurs.
Lots of the exhibits were also from the collections from the National Museum of Singapore, especially the collections of the early British administrators of the colony of Singapore.

Clearly the dinosaur skeletons are the highlight, but if you've been to bigger museums like the Natural History Museum in London, it may be underwhelming.
However, the other displays are pretty good - more interesting than the dinosaurs skeletons in a way. They've made an effort to showcase local flora and fauna where possible, with the whale skeleton (as others have mentioned) being the next big display after the dinosaurs.

Entry to the museum is staggered in order to control the crowd. Given the size of the museum, I can see how this makes sense. But I don't think it gets crowded very often so it should be ok to buy tickets at the venue most of the time. If you prefer to be on the safe side, you can buy tickets online.

Saw families with schooling children who were sketching and reading up on the exhibits. Seems like a good weekend activity for families.",08-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:09:22.259853

The animals are beautifully displayed and the guide provided meaningful information in a very lively and accessible way. Very enjoyable for both adults and children!
After the tour, we followed the guide's advice and went upstairs. Again the display enhances the history of the collections in very accessible ways for abroad visitors and the display of the local flora is simply amazing!
I encourage you to hop on a bus and visit this wonderful museum!",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:09:22.989303

Wish they had done more to make the information (lots of text based panels) more relatable to the general public. e.g - the dinosaurs - could have been compared to the Jurassic age and t-rex because everyone has that basic dino knowledge and then layered the info so we would know if the dinos we have were before or after the Jurassic age - not just by reading the text but perhaps with images/sticker info panels. Would have preferred that to the ""light show"" they put on.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:09:23.363278
