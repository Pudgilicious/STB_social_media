Great Atmosphere!,"So I have not been to many stadiums to watch football, however I am quite certain this is one of the best stadiums to watch football in SE Asia. The atmosphere is great - there were supposedly 50k people and the noise was excellent. It was just a friendly game so I can just imagine if Singapore played another country. The place would be so crazy happening! Additionally, the grounds had air-conditioning which is such a blessing! I expected to be sweating and although it was still a little warm it was relatively comfortable. I truly enjoyed myself and I think going to a stadium in Malaysia will be quite tough to enjoy now.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-31 16:49:51.485381

An elevated outdoor running track on the upper deck covered by the geometrical shades makes for a blissful walk, or jog, whatever that fancies you on the synthetic ground, no rush. Some cycled, like I do.
The stadium is a super structure with a motorised roof over its dome, and the 360 deg seting affords a well placed view of the action on the field below.

It as sold out so 50,000 people attending which is a lot of people but the stadium did not feel overcrowded.

It was well signposted to find our gate and lots of ushers to direct us to our seats.

Note for my next visit to a concert - find out in advance where the merchandise kiosks are as they are likely to be outside and once you enter there is no re-entry.

Taxi ranks and cars are a bit of a mess as there were roadworks and so traffic management was not that great, we managed to get a taxi to leave but it took some 20 minutes to travel the few hundred meters to get to the main road.

Surely this could have been better managed.

,1,73,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/MelvinLin,464504528,04-03-2017,1,This place is run by amateurs!,"We went to watch a rugby match at one of the hospitality suites. By the end of it, we were not sure if it was a hospitality suite or prison.

At half time, we wanted to take a quick walk, and also visit the snack kiosk. We were directed to Level 3 by different members of staff all along the way there.

After we grabbed some drinks at the kiosk, we were stopped while returning to our suite. One of the staff members, let's call her Ms A, insisted that snacks and drinks bought from other sections within the stadium were not allowed to be brought into the suite, for some unknown reason. Suite guests could only consume snacks and drinks ordered by phone from inside the suite. We highlighted the fact that we had previously asked for directions to the snack kiosk with several other staff members, and none of them had brought this up with us.

A few other members of staff then gathered and engaged in a heated discussion, arguing in favour of their own varying interpretations of that policy, all the while not allowing us to proceed back to our suite before they came to a conclusion. During our wait, another guest from the suite next to ours returned from the same kiosk we went to with a tray of beers. He was stopped. He ignored the staff and continued on his way, and nobody made any further effort to stop him.

Next, another guest from another suite approached the gathering and enquired where the merchandise stand was. The reply, by that same Ms A who insisted we could not return to our suite, but who did not enforce the same rule with the other guest with the tray full of beer:

""It is at Gate 3.""

""How can I get to Gate 3?""

""You have to exit, and purchase another ticket at Gate 3 to enter.

""Sorry, purchase another ticket just to buy merchandise? You can't be serious?""

""Yes, that is how it works. And you will not be able to return to your suite after that, because re-entries using the same ticket is not allowed.""

""Great. Thanks for effectively forbidding me from purchasing merchandise just because of the section I am seated at.""

At this point, the match was resuming, and we wanted to quickly return. We went up to Ms A again, and told her that if even among her team they could not agree on what the policy exactly was, with some saying we were allowed to bring those staff back to the suite, and a few others insisting otherwise, then it would be unfair to penalise us for that ambiguity, and deprive us of catching part of the match by holding us back. This was especially, as mentioned, we had made known our intention to patronise the snack kiosk, and were not warned that we should not do that.

She refused to address the part about being fair to us, and just insisted her decision was final, and that whoever else disagreed with her would be ""counselled"". She also promised to investigate and track down whoever had failed to make known the policy to us before we made the purchase. Apparently pointing fingers and disciplining staff (justly, or otherwise) took priority over avoiding inconvenience to guests.

Our previous couple of visits to the sports hub had not impressed, but today's experience was just by far the worst of the lot. Lots of work to be done to avoid continuing to embarrass the nation.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-31 16:50:03.097352

,1,73,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Nicole R,354934390,13-03-2016,4,Still Thirsty,"Went to watch the first Super Rugby match here last night between the Sunwolves and the Cheetahs.
There was a small but vocal crowd and the atmosphere inside was enthusiastic. The seating here is terrific, with unobstructed views and it's a light-filled, airy space. The roof was partially closed so it wasn't too hot, though it was early evening.
There is a glaring issue though, and it was the same when I first went after the stadium opened initially. At that time, I assumed there were very few food and beverage outlets open because the stadium was new.
But last night, with a small crowd of just 8000 people, there were just 8 outlets open. Think about that......
The staff seemed to be trying as best they could, but there are major problems with organisation here. For instance, you cannot do single pours for a thirsty, international rugby crowd, nor can you or should you offer just one type of beer. And you CANNOT ask people to wait 10 minutes for a small batch of soggy fries, after they have already queued for 30 minutes.
I have tickets to the Rugby 7s in April. A large crowd is to be expected for this 2 day, international event.
I sincerely hope the peeps in charge of FnB get their act together and look to places like Hong Kong, to see how they so brilliantly handle the 7s .",03-2016,Family,2020-01-31 16:50:10.036879

We went for the U2 concert and we were advised to come early and glad we did!

When you emerge from the metro at the stadium you arrive in an entertainment town with cafes and bars in full swing. You can get any type of drink and food desired and because there are so many outlets you do not have queue for most of the day like you do in other stadiums. People were sat everywhere on the walls and stairs just eating and drinking and feeling good before the concert. Loads of toilets and everything way signed clearly enough but plenty of Marshall’s and security staff walking around who are mor than willing to direct or assist you.

We had seen the stadium from the train window and several other places while in Singapore. It looked quite impressive from a distance and we decided to take a short walk around it just to say we had been there.

We got off our regular the train to the city at Kallang, and walked perhaps 2 km to the stadium. It was very well signed from the MRT station and easy to find. It looked totally deserted so we were about to turn around and go back to Kallang. We climbed several flights of stairs and strolled across a walkway toward the stadium. There were people riding a bikes and several people walking. Then there was a skateboard park where some guys were training and videoing their tricks. We walked a bit further and saw a running track, a massive array of solar panels, and what looked like a swimming area.

It turned out that even though the stadium was closed there was a lot of activity and things to do. There were life guards at the water park and a couple of people in tubes floating around a flowing pool. It looked very inviting. I saw the Stingray surfing activity and asked the staff when it ran. The staff member got a lifeguard to attend and turned on the water jets for the surf ride, and two of the staff showed off their skills on the board. It looked tons of fun and I was nearly tempted to have a go. The staff were informative and helpful and made a point that safety was priority with all the water activities. There was also a toddlers wading pool with water jets and the kids looked entertained. It was not packed and

The undercover running track around the stadium was being used by joggers, and the stadium roof was open so you could see the magnificent structure. It really was a marvel of engineering. So large and so amazing to look at. It all looked very spread out with plenty of room to walk around.

By this time we were interested in coffee and a bite to eat. Just underneath the stadium was a huge shopping area with a large food hall, an indoor climbing area, shops and directly on the Stadium MRT station.

I would recommend heading to the National Stadium just to look around. You can get there by MRT Stadium station, or from Kallang which requires a 10 minute walk. If you are a sporty person, get your swim suit or running shoes and enjoy the facilities. Afterwards you can grab something to eat or drink. 10/10 for engineering and 5/5 for a fantastic location to visit.",07-2017,Couples,2020-01-31 16:50:37.208594

A fully covered stadium, you will not get rained on, plenty of food and drinks outlets, a mall close by with a food court if you want a better lunch than what you will get at the stadium. Stadium is air conditioned to a degree, makes watching a game more pleasant. Overall enjoyed the HSBC sevens here and look forward to more in the future.

The new venue is stunning, and is a great place to watch any sporting event, I would expect. Public access via taxi or MRT is easy, and signage clear and helpful once the stadium is entered. On line ticketing was less helpful, with apparant mis-information on the availability of tickets being used to sell higher priced tickets suspected. This elevated our seats to a higher level where the availability of food and drink was limited, with a particular complaint being that neither coffee or tea was available, despite being advertised. Not everyone wants to drink alcohol!! Nevertheless, it was the first 7's in this venue, and hopefully the event organisation should improve!",04-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 16:50:45.490116

The stadium is new, with good views of the pitch (although it was clear the pitch surface was poor), covered stadium except for a port hole which gives a cinema style view of the City skyline. Very impressive. Except for the pitch.

I used the underground rail to get to the stadium, 2 stops and about 15 minutes door to door from my Suntech located hotel. Excellent. Drinks available and you can take them to your seat.

The problem was the atmosphere. It was not like a football game. I put it down to two reasons. One if the crowd, not used to big games or team sin competitive games. This wasn't and it was treated like a gig - lots of screaming high pitch voices when certain players were mentioned. Lots of local sin replica shirts but not knowing the game. The other is the acoustics - with the roof the not match related sounds echoed a lot. At least until Chelsea were 0-2 down and the blue replica wearing Singaporeans around me went silent and into a sulk. Interesting in itself, but still not football.

Special allocation of areas for disabled with wheel chair. Many toilets are found by the sides, both male and female. There are food stalls selling food and drinks. A cloak room is available for those who need to deposit big bags which cannot be stored below the seat.

A few important things to take note. The National Stadium has no smoking area for the smokers. All tickets for the entrance is only valid for one entry. Thus, if you exit the stadium, you will not be allowed to enter again, as the tickets are scanned and you enter the stadium by the turnstile, and the tickets could only be used once.
So, it is better that all smokers go for their last cigarette away from the stadium before the entry.

Get your tickets ready when approaching the entrance gate. You must enter via the Gate Number which is indicated on your ticket. When you arrive at Stadium MRT Station, it is better you take the EXIT B, towards the OCBC Arena. Turn Right after your exit and you will go up the escalator to Gate 6.

Refer to the Block Number, 113 to find your seat allocation. The rows of the seats are given alphabet from A from the bottom up to Z to the TOP. After Z, the next row is AA, then BB, CC, and so forth.

No large lens, tripod, monopod or selfie sticks are allowed. Do wear comfortable cotton t-shirt, bermudas, shorts to the stadium as Singapore is a tropical country with temperatures in the 30 degrees.

It's a great place to view sporting events live and in comfort. It was a much needed stadium - its predecessor was prehistoric! Good television relay to both ends. No supports partially blocking views - so it has positive attributes.

You need to avoid promo packages offering food and drink - food is absolutely atrocious and I mean absolutely atrocious!! My package at the Rugby 7's included two meals per day. Chicken curry hawkers style in a plastic economy class airline packing. Not good - but the second meal was even worse - cold hot dogs - they couldn't give them away, no one was eating them. Beer was reasonable however.

The toilets are interesting - there are no locks on the cubicle doors - I guess this must be influenced by rural China where toilets very often have no doors at all. I have put in a photo and all doors have no lock or closing device.

Singaporeans are not very into sport despite having a swimming Gold in the last olympics- sports events have frequent blasts of loud music - even whilst the match is in play. Irritating to the sportsman but amusing to the drunkard who's had a few too many and has no respect for the team, other than his own that are playing their best for their country.

Ventilation of the stadium is surprisingly good although they just open a small part of rooftop, website has stated it will be as cooling as the aircon, in real, when too many people in there, it's not cold anymore.

Other than that, they sell food and snacks after they check in your ticket. They have pizza, expensive snacks and drinks, $4 for 100plus, $4 for cheap snacks. Well, that's the only event day they can make money.

Stadium is way too big for concert. After the most expensive seats and vip, more than half of the field were kept empty! Then followed by second floor far far away of medium prices of tickets. I can hardly find the singer. I was sitting at the side, $138 ticket, yes cheap ticket but at least you have big screen yes they have but they don't have close up of Amei's face!!!! Terrible director or producer of that night.

I look back the previous concert back in 2012, old indoor stadium it was perfectly done! I can see the singer's close up on few big screens! Sound was bad, when everybody singing along, singer's voice gone. So disappointed!",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:52:22.380548
