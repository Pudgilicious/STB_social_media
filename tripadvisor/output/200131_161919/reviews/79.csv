It is large and offers a good variety of fashion and specialty retail outlets for the dedicated shopper. However, we found it difficult to get very excited about this shopping mall. It appeared to be a bit tired and in need of some rejuvenation.
The most positive thing that can be said about this mall is that it is well served by public transport. There is a rapid transit railway station located immediately below it and public buses run by it, along Orchard Road.
However there are other much better shopping malls located elsewhere along Orchard Road.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-31 17:20:14.082333

They also have a small shop for those who want to order curtains.
But wow the fabric and yarn shop is huge! Roll upon roll of fabric with jelly rolls and fat quarters.
There are lots and lots of deals on but many of them are for members only eg batik fat quarters are S$7.99 each or 10 for S$30 if you are a member. It's free to be one just fill in a form and get your membership card. Each time you buy something they scan your card.
Easy to pay by UK credit card, they swipe it and you put your pin number in.
I also got 2 jelly rolls of batiks, 20 in a roll, for S$15 for the two.
A lot of the signs for the deals are misleading - most people wouldn't know many are for members only and the others say eg 40percent off the fabric. A few signs say 40percent off if you buy 4 yards or more. Some is $30/yard.
There is a similar deal on some of the ribbons ranging up to $18 a yard. So you have to buy 4 yards of any to get 50percent off.
I also bought a remnant, 1 metre (they appear to use both yards and metres) at 60% off.
To pay or have your fabric cut you press a button for a numbered ticket and then wait a few minutes for your turn. It seems much fairer that way.
I spent hours in Spotlight and could have spent a lot more time here but I thought it polite to get back to the family.
It's easy to find a toilet as they are well sign posted. So is the taxi rank. The buses stop outside and the metro is either in the basement of the building or over the road.

Plaza Singapura is located at the eastern end of Orchard Road, Singapore’s famous shopping strip. Easily reached by bus and MRT, the mall sits atop of Dhoby Ghaut MRT station. Escalators from the platforms take you to the basement floor of the mall, but if you’ve never been before make sure to read the signs carefully as Dhoby Ghaut is a major interchange for three MRT lines, North South Line (red), North East Line (purple) and Circle Line (yellow). I usually come from Bras Basah on the Circle Line, a one station hop to the terminus and a short escalator ride to the entrance of the food court on the basement floor. Still using the MRT it’s easily reachable from other touristy areas of Singapore: Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Little India and the western end of Orchard Road. The multi-level shopping mall has a large central atrium with escalators on each end. Lifts are also available for the elderly, disable and families. You’ll find all manner of retail shops, from clothing, shoes, homewares, to luggage, art and craft, etc. Cafes and restaurants are also plentiful. On the top floor there’s an entertainment area with arcade games and a cinema. Back on the ground floor in the middle of the atrium, a street style market sets up every day with tables of clothes, shoes, cosmetics, small electrical gear, phone accessories, etc. Vendors change day by day. If you are a collector of figurines and movie replicas I recommend this mall. Several shops are scattered on lower floors, the majority on the top 7th floor. Plaza Singapura is also connected to The Atrium at Orchard via internal walkways on levels 1, 3 and 4.

However, not recommended if you are in a hurry and not familiar with it. There are no signages to help you locate a specific unit, and this means you have to walk every lane on the floor to locate it. The management could have easily made it more friendly by having directory signs on unit numbers. The escalators are set in such a way that you have to walk around nearly the full floor to get to the next one. If you are intending to just travel up or down the escalator just to get to your destination and not window shop- time is wasted with the extra walk. Customer Service counter is curiously placed on level 4 and behind the restaurants. Better naming of the building could help - for instance, there is Plaza Singapura Extension and I took me a long time to learn that it is the larger annex of the entire mall. Not even the shop assistants could help as they only know the place as Plaza Singapura.

After the game we went down to the food hall on the 6th level - so many food stalls to choose from - we had two dishes from the dessert stall - I enjoyed the durian ice dish. Very tasty.

I visited a few other times while transiting at Dhauby Ghaut SMRT station.
