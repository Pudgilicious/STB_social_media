It is definitely worth the visit if you are into war time nostalgia.
Regardless, honouring the dead who fought for their country is a wonderful thing to do, when you look at the young ages of the soldiers, you have a sense of great loss for the communities they came from.
The memorial honours the men and women from Britain, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, India, Malaya, the Netherlands and New Zealand who died in the line of duty during World War II.
There are more than 4,400 white gravestones lined up in rows on the cemetery’s gentle slope. Significantly the Chinese Memorial in plot 44 marks a mass grave for 69 Chinese servicemen who fought for Singapore.

There is a memorial book that you can sign.. even some of those messages were sad.

If you expect to take a taxi, you may find if very difficult to get another taxi back, so I would recommend organising transport there and back. For those with an interest in world war two, its a sobering walk back in time as you really that the solders are buried in units and on the days that they were killed. As a consequence you can easily get a feeling for the battles that were fought on a daily basis. It also hits home that many young men and women gave their lives defending Singapore against an invader and that taking time to walk around is the least that we all can do given the sacrifice they made.

Its a reality check as for me, any worries or stress that I had walking into the place was instantly forgotten and afterwards seemed to be rather petty given the history of what this place represents.

I highly recommend it, I found it a humbling place and moving reading the headstones of many who had fallen all those years ago.",09-2015,Family,2020-01-31 16:53:28.317940

We spent about three hours there moving around the different parts of the cemetery
at the top part of the area, all names of those buried there are engraved on the walls.

This was a very moving part as my wife found several of her family there which she did not know about. There is one section for family members as well

The whole area is very well laid out and kept very clean and tidy by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

A very quiet place as well even though two motorways are very close by.

The steps leading up to the memorial is through a well tended cemetery that makes very sober reading of the gravestone memorials. The range of military units and more importantly the ages of the fallen make one realise the enormity of the sacrifices made by our ancestors.
The memorial is as many throughout the world similar, however the effort in in its making and the recording of the names brings home the futility of war. Reading the names and seeing your own makes one question, was that a relation. or just a coincidence? Perhaps it would be better to visit this area independently.

I was waiting for the sun to go down to take sunset pictures with the backdrop of the Memorial Walls of the Kranji War Memorial when dark clouds were fast coming my direction. I had a choice to brave the rain and continue to wait for the sun to go down or make a break out of the War Memorial. I was lucky to head down the hill as the guard was about to close the gates. It was already 6.30 pm, the closing time. I cannot imagine how I were to keep the war casualties company, for the night, if the rain wasn’t on the way.
I managed to capture a few shots of my imaginary sunset at the Memorial.

I started early (3.30 pm) as I wanted to reach Kranji to catch the sunset using the graves as a backdrop. Arriving early I had time to locate the State Cemetery which hangs on the left front and at the far north, and partially hidden, I found the burial place of the First President of Singapore, Inche Yusof bin Ishak. The second President, Benjamin Henry Sheares, sleeps in a simple grave nearer to the entrance and can be seen clearly from the road to the entrance of the Memorial.

But my second walk-by was different. I stopped to take in how significant it truly is.

I had mixed feelings about this memorial: respect for the brutality that befell the armed services of so many nations that fought to protect Singapore; a moment of reflection for the fallen in the line of duty; the horrors that the local Singaporeans endured at the hands of the brutal Japanese invaders. And then the thoughts of young people who never knew any of this. Even Japanese tourists.

There is no question that the Kranji Memorial is poignant and thought-provoking.

It's 1.1km from the MRT, so I headed out fairly early to avoid the midday sun. You can take a bus two stops from the Kranji MRT, but you'd still have to walk about half the distance up the driveway, so if that's an issue, a taxi may be a better option.",11-2016,Business,2020-01-31 16:58:19.888040

There are two cemeteries here: the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery and the State Cemetery.

The State Cemetery on the right after the main gate is the final resting place of Singapores first and second Presidents. The first, Yusof Ishak who tomb is in the far corner, surrounded by a hedge is the same President who's head appears on the banknotes. Benjamin Shears is the other President here.

We then enter the main gate - so many war dead. Singapore fell in February 1942 and many of the graves stem from this time. There are British, Australian, New Zealand, Indian and others. How sad is war - look no further. The cemetery is immaculately kept and is serene and embraces solitude. It abounds in wildlife also - birds, butterflies and reptiles. Take a while and walk around. If you took a taxi there, you could walk back to the station as it's all downhill from the cemetery. It will also afford opportunities to spot birds and butterflies.

It is quite a distance from the centre of the city but worth the time it takes to get there. The easiest way is by taxi which is not too expensive. A tip however, if you go ask the taxi to wait for you or make sure you have numbers to ring for a taxi to get you back to your hotel. Otherwise you might have a long wait ! As with all cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commmission, the grounds and graves themselves were immaculately kept and it was a very peaceful place",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:59:24.682766

Worth it if you are interested in war history.
Take the MRT to Kranji stn. Come out and turn left. Go past the turf club on your left.
