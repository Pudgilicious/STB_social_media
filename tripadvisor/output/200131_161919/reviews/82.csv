I love visiting different temples and naturally when in Singapore I wanted to go to the local Hindu temples. The Mariamman temple located at Chinatown Singapore is a major tourist attraction - you can see by the number of persons visiting. People from all faiths are welcome inside but kindly refrain from taking pictures of the deity inside the main sanctum sanctorium. Being here makes you almost forget that you are not in Tamil Nadu. It is an incredibly beautiful temple and very well maintained. Visitors are requested to dress modestly and remove footwear before entering the temple.,03-2019,Family,2020-01-31 17:28:02.136748

With that aim in mind we visited Buddhist, Hindu temples, mosques and churches as much locales.

At these sites found the experience spiritual, in terms of seeing folks find meaning in worship. One doesn't need to believe in a value system to see its impact on people.

Regrettably, we found Hindu temples for some odd reason appeared unkept and ill attended. Sri Mariamman was no exception. We arrived with high hopes given all the reviews on TA and elsewhere. There was not a single soul worshipping or in any activity that would indicate a ritual even. A few people was sitting near the door inside and engaged in an what appeared to be a loud altercation.

The management needs to clean the place thoroughly and bring it up to its historic significance.

Due to this underwhelming experience our trip to the site was not memorable at all and we are perplexed at the high rating on TA. The only saving grace was that we were able to walk to the Buddhist temple and to a very different experience.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-31 17:28:20.099604

Every October, the temple hosts the Thimithi festival (Fire Walk) devotees queue along South Bridge Rd to hotfoot it over burning coals!
The fire-walking ceremony is held in honour of Draupadi Amman, who is considered the reincarnation of the Hindu goddess Mariamman. Married to the five Pandava brothers, Draupadi was forced to prove her purity by walking on fire, and emerged unharmed. The festival of Thimithi is celebrated to commemorate this event.

During the ceremony, the chief priest leads the festival procession from Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple at Serangoon Road and reaches Sri Mariamman Temple after a four-kilometre walk. There, devotees will walk across hot coals to prove their faith.",08-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:28:31.430783

,1,82,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,650930880,08-02-2019,4,Singapore’s First Mandir,"Sri Mariammam is the first mandir ever built in Singapore, dating from 1827, a few years after Raffles had secured a lease from the Sultan of Johore. Its founder, an East India Company clerk, had actually arrived with Raffles, but due to protracted difficulties in securing a permanent location for a Hindu place of worship, it took three moves and almost a decade before construction began in 1826. In the early days of Singapore, most Hindus were from South India (Tamil is still the official Indian tongue in Singapore), so it’s no surprise that this mandir is South Indian in spirit. Mariammam—Mother Mari—is the mother goddess in South India, and the goddess of rain.

As you approach Sri Mariammam, you’ll immediately be struck by the colourful monumental entrance into the temple compound. This is a gopuram, a hallmark of Dravidian architecture (as well as Khmer architecture, derived from South India: you can see gopurams, now colourless, at Angkor Wat). Sri Mariammam’s five-story gopuram consists of the actual gateway below, recapitulated by five “doorways” above, each slightly smaller than the one below, and each surrounded by colourful deities; at the very top is an ornamental cylinder, which itself is topped by a row of small golden kalasams. In India, kalasams with much longer upper points often serve as flagpoles for temple banners, but I’d be surprised if you could hoist a handkerchief onto these stub-topped kalasams. (See Gopuram photo; if you look to the extreme right of this photo, you’ll see the Buddha Tooth Temple, the most important Chinese Buddhist site in Singapore, not quite a stone’s throw away, but perhaps within sling-shot range if you’re good with a sling).

On top of the walls leading up to the gopuram, you’ll see a veritable herd of zebu, the venerable sacred white cows of India, with a pair of lions as well, one on either side of the gopuram. The cows are rather complacent about these lions, apparently having read up on the subject and realizing that lions pose no real threat in Singapore (see Zebu Lion and Gopuram photo). Look up once you’re inside the mandir compound and you’ll see additional zebu as well, sometimes flanking Lord Krishna with his flute (see Lord Krishna 1 and Lord Krishna 2 photos).

There’s a colourful and elaborately-decorated onion dome above the main shrine itself, with deities and demons, sambars and lions (separated from each other), lots of saris, and a golden finial on top, one you actually could attach a banner to (see Dome 1 and Dome 2 photos). Going past an elaborate and colourful standing column gets you to the heart of the mandir, where you’ll be greeted by the gigantic head of a fearsome warrior, sitting in a box. I have no idea what his head is doing there, but I’m confident that either it’s serving a useful purpose, or he was decapitated for a good reason. (See Entry and Decapitation photo.)

Inside, there are additional colourful deities, including Sri Mariammam herself with her scimitar protecting the main altar (see Mariammam photo). Ceilings and walls are all bright pastels; the least colourful thing I saw inside the inner sanctum was the television set. I’m not quite sure what a TV is doing inside a mandir, but if India is up by 3 wickets over Australia in the next World Cup final, a ready TV might be useful to have (see Colourful Corridors photo). Inside the mandir compound, you may see monks burning incense (easily obtained almost everywhere over in Little India) or just wandering on various errands round the grounds (see Incense and Monk photos).

If you’re lucky and there’s a festival going on, you’re certain to get a concert by the classic Carnatic musical duo of nadaswaram and thavil. The first is a double-reed wind instrument, and the second a drum; both are classic instruments of Tamil Nadu. We were lucky: a wedding started up a few minutes after we arrived. The music of the nadaswaram is believed to be auspicious and it is so loud that when played at Sri Mariamman, you can hear it in Chinatown. Proud Tamils will assure you with a straight face that the nadaswaram is the loudest wind instrument in the world that is not brass. Presumably they’ve never heard Scottish bagpipes (see Nadaswaram and Thavil photo).

Two final comments: (1) TA, following Western tourist usage, tends to call any place of worship except Christian churches and Muslim mosques, either a “temple” or a “pagoda.” Hindu places of worship are mandirs in most of India, and I use that word here, but technically, Sri Mariammam, being Dravidian, is a kovil. “Temple” will do. (2) Five years ago I was delighted to discover—and bring to TripAdvisor’s attention—a sister-kovil to this one, Sri Muthamariammam, with a spectacular nine-story Dravidian gopuram, in the spice-trading city of Matale; since then, over 200 other reviews have been submitted and it’s now one of the top-5 rated attractions there. If you’re ever in Sri Lanka, travelling between Kandy and Sigiriya, don’t miss it.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-31 17:29:24.622682

Throughout the temple, there is much decorative detailing throughout. There are a series of small altars where you would find people worshipping.

It is still a practicing Temple with many worshipers there the day I went. There are some restricted areas, admission is free but the place charges a small amount if you want to take photos which you should.

You can walk around behind the main room and there are many areas with separate prayer areas and shrines. These were particularly interesting to me and quite photogenic too. Mostly in 3d instead of paint which is a very cool effect. The temple facade is particularly interesting.

Be prepared to take off your shoes in order to enter.
