According to their website the Cathedral is ‘a busy church but we will always try and make you welcome’. We didn’t feel welcome at all. We attend church every week (I’m an ordained Christian minister in the UK) found the worship to be very standard - not particularly inspiring. My husband has coeliac disease so asked about gluten free wafers for communion - no one seemed to have heard of gluten free so he couldn’t take communion. One reason we wanted to go was to see the Coventry Cathedral cross of nails - an amazing symbol of hope and reconciliation - it’s hidden in the pulpit and no one but the preacher is allowed near it - what a shame - the story of the Cross of Nails and the movement for peace and reconciliation should be told not hidden away. My husband stood on the pulpit steps to try and take a photo (there was nothing to say he shouldn’t) and he was told very rudely that he shouldn’t have stood on the steps and a chain (not there before was placed across. When we asked about seeing the cross we were told that we couldn’t. Even when I explained a link between my late father and Coventry and also between him and Singapore we were still not allowed to see the cross. Apart from this encounter no one spoke to us (apart from the person who’d led the service saying goodbye on the way out) Very sad - I certainly wouldn’t go back. Fortunately our day was redeemed by the very helpful welcome we received an hour later at the botanical gardens which are stunningly beautiful.

Take a look at the stained glass windows and if a sunny day as when we visited look at the patterns projected as the sun shines through.

The open windows provide a great view across the grounds to the cricket ground just a short distance away from where from time to time you can hear the sound of willow striking the ball.

But its all-white exterior catches your attention as you drive or walk past on St Andrews Road.

The original St Andrew's Church was built in 1835 and the second was built in 1842.

It was demolished in 1855 after two lightening strikes and rumours of evil spirits and devils spiting the church.

The new foundation stone was laid in 1856 and the first service was in 1861.

Today St Andrew's Cathedral is the focal point of the Anglican community in Singapore.

It is open to the public, and even if you are not a Christian, it is worth visiting, sitting in a pew, and quietly contemplating how peaceful it is inside compared the the hustle and bustle of outside modern Singapore City.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:41:19.869994

St Andrew's has very nice architecture and we saw two couples taking wedding photos. Take some time to visit the interior as it is just as beautiful inside.
