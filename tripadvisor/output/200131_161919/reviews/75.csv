This is a place of worship, and you need to take your shoes off when you enter the temple.

It is reputed to be one of the oldest temples in Singapore. It is beautifully decorated with statues of Hindu Gods. I guess most had a coating of gold coloured paint.

The priests were saying prayers and then sprinkling the worshippers with holy water.

The temple is at its most evocative during each of the four daily puja (prayer) sessions.

The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore and is believed to have been founded in 1881 by labourers from the North Indian state of Bengal. Being so far from home, it’s no wonder they chose such a powerful and protective goddess to dedicate the temple to.

Of course, the temple has undergone extensive renovations and rebuilding since it was founded. Its most distinguishing feature, the entrance tower with intricate carvings of Hindu deities, was added in the 1980s and is actually of a South Indian design, in contrast to the temple’s North Indian heritage.

The location is good, a ten minute walk from Mustafa Centre and just across the road from many Indian restaurants and also a short walk from Bukit TImah road so quite close to Sim Lim Square one of Singapore's most famous computer and mobile phone electronic centres.

As with all Indian temples you need to leave your shoes outside and fortunately there are lots and lots of shelving to place your shoes. The entrance of the temple has two very large wooden doors with big metal studs all over it. The grounds of the temple are not that large but with many colourful statues and you will see lots of people praying here.The temple is quite abuzz with activity and you are freely allowed to wander around inside taking photos.

I actually have found that many Hindu temples are really big but this one is a good size for tourists such as myself to visit and therefore quite busy and certainly a good example of a beautiful Hindu temple. It is well worth the visit when in Little India.",06-2019,Solo,2020-01-31 17:02:14.386401

On most occasions I went there was an elderly man seated outside, whom many worshippers acknowledged. I spoke with him on several occasions at length and he was fascinating to listen to as he gave great insights into religion generally and what was taking place at this temple specifically.

This is an active vibrant Temple, where there are more locals worshipping than tourists, but where tourists are welcome in most parts of the Temple also. There is a great front facade with three dimensional figures which are representations of a wide variety of deities. There are also many small other side places to worship each with its own unique meaning.

I enjoyed the vibrancy of the Temple even though I did not understand some of it until I read about it online. Still, it was worth taking in the essence of a true Temple in the middle of a vibrant neighborhood where the Temple is the center of the spiritual and neighborhood life nearby. Many many families there, they served dinner to the congregants also.

Note, that this place is closed each afternoon for several hours, currently between 12:30pm to 4:00pm, so no access then. I went around 6pm so that I could see the place in daylight, in dusk, and then at night. The street scene is also worth checking out after dark too.

This ceremony (which seems to have repeatedly held each day) consists of public prayers to Kali goddess (the deity to whom the temple is dedicated, and whose frightening statue dominates the interior) and of distribution of blessed rice morsels to the faithful, or however, to whom wants to participate (as our case was). All the ceremony is accompanied by the sound of characteristic hand bells.
The temple is located along Serangoon Road, then the central axis of Little India. Built in the last decades of the nineteenth century as a religious landmark for the many Indian workers in Singapore, it has been restored several times (the last time since 1983).
The traveler who knows the temples of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu (especially renowned those in Madurai) will recognize here the architectural models of that part of India (models which are also found in many other Hindu temples in Singapore and Malaysia): especially the slender pyramid above the temple's facade (gopura), covered with brightly painted statues.
The gopura, inserted in recent renovations, strongly contrasts with the history of the temple, which was originally built for the Indians from Bengal (north-east India), because they constituted the majority of immigrants in Singapore.
So it isn't a temple venerable for its antiquity or authenticity; it is rather significant for its role, in that it illustrates the culture of Hindu immigrants and ultimately the Singapore multiethnic character.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:03:38.954171

Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple, one of the oldest temples in Singapore, was built by Indian pioneers and became the focus of early Indian social and cultural life.

Sri Veeramakaliamman was selected as the chief diety of the temple, being a powerful goddess and the ""Destroyer of Evil"", answering the need of the early Indian migrants for a feeling of security in a new and strange land.

The temple is a riot of colour, and in addition to Sri Veeramakaliamman, there is a confusing pantheon of Hindu dieties and mythological creatures depicted.

The temple is colour and a lot of painting and sculpture found although it is not a big temple. The place are full of Hindu while we are there so I think it is really famous among the local indian people. If you are in little India, i do recommend this temple. It is very close to MRT and easy to get there.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:03:47.066435

However, the grounds did not do justice to the beautiful facade and interior. But then most of Little India's exterior was just a little poorly maintained compared to the rest of Singapore.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:03:47.448357
