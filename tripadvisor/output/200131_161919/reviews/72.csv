During the day we walked around sightseeing and took the day river cruise.
There is so much to see and one has to visit the Merlion water spout.
Cross between lion and mermaid. Sensational day photo locations and a must see.
In saying that you return at night for the light show at 8pm and 10pm. A must see.
Taking the night river cruise gets you up close to the night lights show they stop in front of the display giving you a great uninterrupted view. .
At night the riverfront is a sea of lights, rest and entertainment. Vibrant area one has to see. Great to photograph day and night here to see the vast difference.

Most tourists take a river cruise. I found that walking along both banks of the river gave you a different perspective of the city. There are cafes, bars and restaurants - and there is something for everyone. The high rise buildings of the financial centre of the city overlook the river. Fullerton Hotel has a rooftop bar which has some very nice panoramic views of the city. It is a great sight to watch the sun set.

One of the famous quays is Clarke Quay which is a very lively place at night. You can sit on the banks and just watch the world go by.

The river forms part of the Barina Bay reservoir. Historically it was used a lot for trade - but this led to pollution. As a result, the river has undergone a clean up - and is no longer used for trade purposes - but more for leisure purposes.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-31 16:26:42.152532

We got in from Clark Quay and it was lovely to walk through the the area with the live bands playing, the lights and the party crowd moving around. I wished I would stay on and party but we were flying out the next morning (very early). hence we had dinner at Violet Oon Satay Bar & grill (which was FAB) and then went on the river cruise. lovely ending to our holiday in Singapore.
The Best thing about the cruise to me was the commentary. It brought Singapore alive to me.

,1,72,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/chew eng o,502086292,15-07-2017,5,River of life.,"SINGAPORE RIVER

The Singapore River is approximately 3.2 kilometers long from its current source at Kim Seng Bridge to where it empties into Marina Bay, after Anderson Bridge. When the building of the Barrage at the seaward mouth of Marina Bay is completed a reservoir was formed with the Kallang River and Singapore River both empting it waters into the Bay. Hence both rivers stop receiving tides from the sea. The Barrage also controls flood water from the two rivers in cases of heavy downpour.

The Singapore River may be a short river but it has a history of importance since the days of its founding of modern Singapore, by Sir Stamford Raffles in 1918. What Raffles founded was a good safe harbor with trade soon blossom with the River playing an important part in the landing of lighters bringing goods from ships to its quays. With the construction of the Port of Singapore and the introduction of containers the River soon lost it’s importance as a landing for goods.

By then the River had been over polluted with waste, sludge and oil deposits by boats, and slit. It was smelly and an eye-sore. Lee Kuan Yew the then Prime Minister then threw a challenge to the authorities to clean up the River and to have fish swimming in it one day. Today there are fresh water fishes in the two rivers.

Today the River is clean. Good landscaping and proper planning of the surroundings make the banks a vibrant avenue of restaurants, hotels, banks, and shops. Many 4 to 5 stars hotels such as the Fullerton Hotel, the Novotel, Four Horizons, Holiday Inn, and the iconic Marina Sands Hotel, are here. Many old warehouses were redeveloped and repainted into hotels, restaurants, shops and night clubs. The river cruise program is very popular with the tourist especially the evening cruises.

I had no trouble walking without interruption of vehicle, using the Park Connector (Promenade), from the source at Kim Seng Bridge to its mouth in 55 minutes. The Park Connector is also a good place to jog and I found many expatriates running alongside me.

The actual founding of Singapore was by a Sumatran Prince, Sang Nila Utama, who upon landing on the banks of the River and seeing an animal that looked like a lion, to him, he name the place Singapura, meaning Lion City. In the days of Raffles, The Singapore River was filled with sand bars, salt marshes and mangrove swamps. The River then flowed from Fort Canning Hills and from the marshes behind Kim Seng Bridge, in Havelock area. The Black Bridge was found in this area. In those days bridges was name by color, namely the White Bridge, the Green Bridge and the Black Bridge. The Read Bridge, which was also called the Green Bridge because of its color, is located in Clark Quay, was originally built in 1889, and was named after William Henry Macleod Read. Bridges have their history too. Kim Seng Bridge is named after Tan Kim Seng a wealthy merchant from Malacca who was well known for his donation to the people suffering from various draughts in Singapore. It is interesting to note that the bridge nearby, Jiak Kim Bridge, was named after Kim Seng’s grandson Tan Jiak Kim. Jiak Kim was the founder member of the Straits Chinese British Association and a Legislative Member for 16 years.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-31 16:27:44.952040

At the Merlion Park you can get a Singapore River boat ride. The boat ride lasts an hour and you can see the Singapore River, Clarke Quay, Marina Bay, the Singapore sky line, the Marina Bay Sands and many other things. I would also like to add that before entering the Fullerton Hotel you can also turn left and cross a foot bridge. On the other side are many things like the Asia Civilization Museum and the Raffles Statue.

You can also see the unique lotus shaped ArtScience Museum and the Singapore Flyer across the Helix Bridge.This is also an ideal time to look back and take photos of the Merlion statue from a distance. Coming around before you enter the river, you can see buildings shaped like local durian fruit, which are actually the spectacular Esplande - Theatres on the Bay. As you proceed under the Esplanade and Anderson bridges, you get to see other historic sights on the north side of the river including Raffles Landing Site, and McDonald's Boat Quay on the south. The Boat Quay is home to a lively night scene with numerous restaurants and pubs right on the waterfront. Proceeding along the river, you will pass Clarke Quay, and other historic bridges and and sites. It's an absolutely lovely way to spend an hour or so. If you take the cruise in the evening, you may see some of the sound, light and fountain shows in front of Raffles Landing Site or at Spectra - A Light and Water Show in front of the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Afterwards, you can spend some time at the Merlion, wandering around the harbour, or having a cool drink at McDonald's Boat Quay. Perfect!",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-31 16:30:08.594997

The river and surrounds were hives of activity and the landscape much different to today's. The place was dirty and smelly, all types of refuse in the river; but it was exciting and exotic, my first taste of the Orient. So much change, the river now a reservoir and included in the plan to make Singapore self sufficient in water resources in the not too distant future. The bumboats and junks are gone, no more raucous banter as the workers went about their tasks; the area is sanitised, surrounded by high-rises buildings, restored shophouses, shopping malls, restaurants, cultural facilities, tourists attractions and the preserved remnants of the colonial past, and you now travel the river in comfort in a river taxi or cruise boat powered by electric motors. No more 'putt, putt' of the old motors on the bumboats.",10-2018,Couples,2020-01-31 16:30:46.938558

This time we were staying in Singapore over New Year and left the boat cruise until the afternoon at the end of over trip before leaving for the airport. It was a very pleasant way of saying goodbye and enjoying seeing the ever changing Singapore skyline from a different perspective at a very leisurely pace.

We went for a boat with a large open area at the rear of the deck to get the best views and were rewarded.

We had also visited the Sky Park above the Marina Bay which gives you a bird’s eye perspective which contrasts really well with the fish eye perspective provided by the boat.

Another thing of note was the number of boats that left Clarke Quay to see the fireworks in the Bay – they were packed but once again I am not sure how good a view you would have had from inside the boat.

Trade exploded, and other quays, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, for instance were developed. This humble river is where Sir Stamford Raffles first stepped on the island in 1819. In the 1970s when shipping trade was moved, the river underwent a transformation. There are many hotspots dotted along the river, you can cool down with a drink and enjoy mouth-watering cuisines at Boat Quay. Keen for more heart-pumping entertainment? Dance the night away at Clarke Quay at the trendy nightspots that once were warehouses. For a slice of nostalgia, stop by the moored Chinese junks ('tongkangs') that have been beautifully refurbished into floating restaurants. You’ll find laid-back charm at Robertson Quay’s converted godowns, perfect for a morning coffee. Or stroll down the river and spot the sculptural artworks that depict Singapore’s past and present.

To tourists, the Singapore River is largely divided into three quays:

Boat Quay (pubs and small eateries, restaurants)
Clarke Quay (clubs, pubs, some overpriced food and then some activities)
Robertson Quay (mostly residential with a number of good dining options)

For tourists coming to Singapore River, I'd strongly suggest that you'd figure out where you want to end the evening, because the three quays are strongest in the later part of the day with its choice of dinner and drinking places.

For the highest energy person, you should end in Clarke Quay, that's where all the music and action is. For something a bit less formal, Boat Quay, and if you want more laid back, Robertson Quay.

I'd strongly suggest you take a river boat tour which starts in Clarke Quay, it gives you a quick overview of the most exciting bits of the river and its history.

<Trivia> The river has changed tremendously over the past 15 years since they converted it into a reservoir, so there are no longer any tides. This had an interesting upside as during low tide in the past, the water levels would dip and there would be a stench from the mud underneath, this is no longer a problem.",04-2018,Solo,2020-01-31 16:36:36.454053

There are some interesting statues on the Riverside and you can easily stroll down one bank and cross over to the other to return to your start point dropping in for refreshments or meal in one of the many places on the Riverside. The round trip is probably just over 2km and bearing in mind the heat and humidity could easily take half a day depending on pit stops.",06-2017,Solo,2020-01-31 16:36:47.750886

To tourists, the Singapore River is largely divided into three quays:

Boat Quay (pubs and small eateries, restaurants)
Clarke Quay (clubs, pubs, some overpriced food and then some activities)
Robertson Quay (mostly residential with a number of good dining options)

For tourists coming to Singapore River, I'd strongly suggest that you'd figure out where you want to end the evening, because the three quays are strongest in the later part of the day with its choice of dinner and drinking places.

For the highest energy person, you should end in Clarke Quay, that's where all the music and action is. For something a bit less formal, Boat Quay, and if you want more laid back, Robertson Quay.

I'd strongly suggest you take a river boat tour which starts in Clarke Quay, it gives you a quick overview of the most exciting bits of the river and its history.

<Trivia> The river has changed tremendously over the past 15 years since they converted it into a reservoir, so there are no longer any tides. This had an interesting upside as during low tide in the past, the water levels would dip and there would be a stench from the mud underneath, this is no longer a problem.",04-2018,Solo,2020-01-31 16:44:48.227815

It extends to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay and each quite different to the other. It would worth learning a little bit of its history to appreciate its current beauty.
Boat Quay is right smack in the CBD area and where those working in the Raffles Place area and its vicinity go for their lunch at one of the many bars, cafes and restaurants along the river or the street parallel to it. In the evenings this is also where the working professionals mingle and have drinks after office hours. The area comes alive. On Friday and Saturday evenings, the street is closed to traffic from 6pm to 1am.
Clarke Quay is party central where there are not only restaurants and bars but also night clus, a favourite of the young when the sun sets. Food wise, there are plenty of good restaurants offering Asian, Western, Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean and many other cuisines.
Robertson Quay is probably the most finesse of the 3. Families with young kids tend to prefer here as there is a ""promenade"" by the river where the kids can scooter/cycle while the parents chill at a bar/cafe/restaurant. Restaurants aplenty and with no night club in the vicinity, it is more sedated and relaxing.",07-2018,Friends,2020-01-31 16:47:47.374968

I stayed at Robertson Quay 3 weeks and didn't realise it was the Singapore River until one day I was crossing Jiak Kim bridge at the Robertson Quay end and read a manhole cover. I asked my friend (who has lived at Robertson Quay nearly 3 years) if it was indeed the Singapore River and she didn't know. I needed confirmation, so eventually found someone who did know. Well anyway, you don't have to know what it's called to enjoy strolling along the River Walk and there are a myriad options for dining, drinking, or both. You won't see any dragon or even dragon boats, but you might just be lucky enough (as I was) to see a giant lizard basking on it's (concrete) banks or an otter or two frolicking in the murky waters under the bridge up near Jiak Kim Street.

Little boat trips to be had from Clarke Quay down to MBS - probably best at night for the laser show.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:49:17.226475

Much of the Singapore River walk actually has charm but Clarke Quay has overlaid the old godowns and warehoues with martian umbrellas that don;t really keep out the sun or the rain! Robertson Quay has more charm, fine dining but remains the quieter end. Boat Quay section of pubs and restaurants has managed to retain some of the charm.
San Antonio has many small shops with quality souvenirs and wide range in prices.. That is lacking in Singapore river area except for Selangor Pewter shop and 1-2 others! AFter drinking and dinner, many visitors may want to ""walk it off"" by doing some souvenir and luxury shopping?",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:49:19.475651

All of these places are fairly quiet during the day, but come to life as soon as the sun sets.
It may be rather warm during the day, but if you can take the heat it is enjoyable to walk along the river where people bike, walk their dogs or play with their children.
After sunset it becomes cooler and much more lively! There is a great choice of all sorts of restaurants, bars, wine-bars etc.
Robertson Quay is a bit more local / expat and less 'touristic' (less noisy) then Boat & Clarke Quay.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 16:49:20.626579
