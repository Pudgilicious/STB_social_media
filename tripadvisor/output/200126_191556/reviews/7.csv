Carriages are very large holding up to 12 people. We were there in late August and were the only people in the carriage so we didn't have to push past others to take in the stunning views. Carriages move very slowly, I believe it took about 30 minutes for a single revolution. You can easily pick out many of Singapore's landmarks including Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore F1 motor racing track.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-26 19:16:30.060155
,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/glenndjangkar,707822971,08-09-2019,5,Unique View of Singapore,"Visited this site with my wife and son during the first night of our September 2019 visit.

As a first timer to this place, the best way to describe it is that it looks like a giant wheel that spins slowly and carries its riders to the top. Upon getting close, you realize how big the compartments are given that it seats about 10 and thereâ€™s space for people to walk around inside and enjoy the view.

As the wheel begins to take you up, there is a voiceover describing the things that you are seeing as well as promoting the various tourist attractions to visit in Singapore. A victorious-sounding jingle plays when your compartment reaches the top.

The Singapore Flyer is a safe place. You donâ€™t feel the discomfort of going at such tall heights. I would advice you to keep a close watch of your children when going into or going down from the Singapore Flyer compartment. This is because you go on and off with the compartment still moving albeit slowly. Even so you should take care of your little ones.

Speaking on behalf of the argument of visiting Singapore Flyer at 6-7 PM, I can say that the highlight of the ride was seeing all the lights being turned on at the various buildings.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-26 19:16:30.233616

remember to get your tickets on the ground floor not as we did get upstairs and then to go down again.

the only down thing was that we had to have our photos taken - after the flight we bought two copies of two photos and were told we could download the others from a website - this I was not able to do and chasing the company they did not help at all
