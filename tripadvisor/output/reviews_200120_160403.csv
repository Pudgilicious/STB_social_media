Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance.

It's only a short ride from the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal (where you can leave you luggage). The super trees were super. Early in the day there are fewer people so we really enjoyed the Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's surprising how huge the domes really are and they have unique displays.

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-20 16:04:22.159855

Floral fantasy a little further way from the centre but well worth the hike or shuttle. A small area with floral decorations and interpretations followed by the finale of a 4d film following the path of a dragonfly.....non moving seats on request for those of us with motion sickness

Walking around the clevelry desigined trditonal gardens before going to the tree area was a quiet way to spend some time.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The best part for kids is the children‚Äôs gardens where they can play with water in small fountains. Kids will enjoy to their fullest here.",09-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 16:05:29.615529

For me, this visit was enlighting and giving a new perspective that science and technology can make our great nature even more WOW (a.k.a jaw dropping, LOL).
This area is quite huge and perhaps need ""strategy"" so you can use your time wisely and get everything=)
If the weather is good, I suggest you to go around the park first and explore the outdoor area..because the two domes (include the pathways) are totally indoor so no worries with the rain.
All the outdoor area is free to explore..no charge..But for two domes they charge entrance ticket and another charge for observation deck+OCBC skyways.
If you are too tired to walk, the outdoor area can be explored by shuttle car that costs SGD8/1 round trip, but me myself prefered to explore the park on foot. You'll have more time to oberserve and find a lot of photo-shoot spots while walking around. But if you go by shuttle, they provide a recording tape that will give you explanation about the garden. In here, you can see heritage gardens, sun pavilion (cactus) and supertrees while walking around.
After going around the outdoor areas, perhaps you can enter the observation deck and OCBC skyways, because they will close earlier than the domes. But in this visit, I didn't buy the ticket for observation deck & OCBC skyways, so I can't tell you a lot about this..may be next time I'll visit =)
After finished observing the outdoor area, I had lunch first before entering the domes. I would recommend to eat beef & prawn satay at Satay by The Bay. It tastes good, good portion, extra juicy meat and not so expensive. SGD7 for 10 beef satay & SGD2/each prawn satay. The prawn is quite big and juicy. My kids love the prawn very much.. If you don't want to be too full, you can eat with rice cake/""lontong"" (in Malay/Indonesian language) that costs SGD1/small square piece. But if you think you need more carb, maybe better if you just buy rice on other stall and you'll get more by paying the same amount. You can also try water chestnut for the drink, and refreshing tropical fruit for your dessert.
After finished my refreshing lunch, I went to the domes. There are 2 domes, the Flower Domes and the Cloud Forest Dome. I entered the Cloud Forest Dome first...From the first time the entrance door was opened, a huge tall indoor waterfall welcomed me..and it's really a jaw-dropping moment=) I think that is one of the wow-factor of this spot. Perhaps you need to bring jacket, because it's a bit cold inside (even the tap water is cold) and a bit splashy if you take photo near the fall. I was mesmerized by the building structure, how they pump gallons of water all the time to make the man-made waterfall looks alive! and how they use sun panel on the supertree top to make everything works. How smart is the creator of this place!!
This dome is bigger than the Flower Dome..you need to walk on several floors to explore all, but don't worry they have lift too and it is totally accessible for wheel chair and baby stroller. They have waterfall observation deck, the lost world zone (full of mist and you can see carnivore plants), stalagmits collection, orchids, and several unique displays & sculptures from many countries. They even have a lego flowery pond =)
After finished with the Cloud Forest Dome, we went into Flower Dome. There are so many collection of trees and flowers that are arranged to certain theme. The theme will change due to certain period. If the weather is good, you can see the sunset from here too..
The collection of the plants are so many and various and they do alive!! Imagine that many kinds of plants that usually live in different types of habitat can live in one same place.. They put complete explanation on a board in front of every plants. There are several sculpture from stem and roots and they were amazing artwork.
In my visit on January, they were in changing process from Christmas theme to Dahlia (Chinese New Year) theme..The Dahlia will be fully displayed on Jan 17 (if I'm not mistaken). But the existing flower arrangement is still even great for me=) We took several photos in front of the themed garden before leaving this dome.
Then here comes the dinner time.. I chose to eat at Pollen. I recommend you to eat here because it's very near to Supertree..so in case you bring children like me..you know, they eat so slow =) so, if they can't finished their meal before the Supertree Light Show, you can watch while you eat =) There are several restaurants that you can pick here, such as Vietnamese Pho, Japanese, Singaporean chicken/pork rice, Texas fried chicken..at that time I tried the Japanese food and it's so yummy...SGD10-12 for one menu. The portion is quite big, I can not finished myself =) If you want complete menu just add few dollars and you'll have miso soup, 2 slices of watermelon and salad. Bring your tumbler and tap water is free all over the park if you want to save money =)
Then here it is..the closing for this day..the light show...it started on 7.45 p.m and last for around 15min. It great to see the light on supertrees flipping following the music and it's a good photo-shoot spot too with the lighted supertrees behind you..=) you can see the lighted singapore flyer and marina bay sands too from here. In case you missed the show, you can wait for the next show on 8.45 p.m.

Christmas Wonderland it wasn‚Äôt.,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.

We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn‚Äôt an option for us.

It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn‚Äôt have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.

At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??

We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn‚Äôt an option.

Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly‚Äôs promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.

After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.

Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.

All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 16:07:18.926442

This man-made master piece lives up to the the hype and offers a beautiful experience worth the lifetime.

The Musical Light Show is spectacular and if you fail to get a ticket (limited tickets makes it impossible to accommodate everyone so please book it way in advance) to observe it from the viewing deck

The light show takes place twice every night and is on for 15 minutes. The first show is on at 7:45pm and the second is on at 8:45pm. An extra show on Holidays is added, for which you'll have check on their official website (usually a 9.45pm show) .

There are many spots to see this beauty but our favorite (and Highly recommended) was to lie down on the concrete circles supporting the Garden Towers called Super tree Groves an hour prior to the show as they fill-in fast.

Others being:

From above, on the skywalk of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, decent view minus the music

On the promenade by the Dragonfly Lake, at the park entrance between Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

The Deck / Skywalk exactly above the public loo overlooking the Super tree Groves (have some steps to climb up)

Other than that there are observatories like Cloud Forest, Flower Forest Dome which are worth the dime.

Numerous sculptures and and arts installed in beautiful corners are worth enjoying.

Restaurants are plenty but standards aren't that great so would suggest to stick to McDs in the Garden.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-20 16:07:35.175311

The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.
I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in.

Lots of flowers, plants, trees and a magnificent water fall. Easy to walk around with kids. Costs 12 SD for a kid and 20 SD for an adult. Worth visiting. Apparently you need to pay similar fee to the Flower Dome, but did not visit that this time.

Then to the OCBC Skyway. Last time you get up there is at 9PM and you will need to get a time slot from the ticket booth after 7.30PM. The light show will be at 19.45 and 20.45 and we managed to see it first from the ground and then from the Skyway. Both were impressive but you get better pictures from the ground :)

Very easy to access by metro and you can find a lot of signs whos here so you cannot get lost. I was really impressed and wasnt expect that good. If you want to go up in the trees you must pay another 7 Dollar inside the garden. This is seprate from the enrance fee. Food is kinda cheap but beers are expensive.

- Loved the waterfall and carnivorous plants
- Skywalk experience was nice and gave a better feel of the olace
- Good place to spend time wiyh family, specially the light show in evening
- Food is awesome in the food court on the other side of bridge (unable to recall the name but you will find sign boards for guidance)

CONS:
- Christmas carnival was not at all attractive and needs separate ticket.
- Light show must have been special till few years back but now its a common thing around the world, have seen similar stuff in Akshardham in New Delhi India
- The whole experience seemed to be a bit stretched over the day, specially covering everything during day and then waiting for lights to comeon at night
- OCBC Skywalk is mostly non operational in December due to climate issues. They are very cautious and dont allow operations even if there is only a chance of a rain.

We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.

Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".

So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change.

If you want a crash course in why, get yourselves on down to Gardens by The Bay.
My partner and I are no stranger to botanical gardens, which is the most boujey thing I have ever written I am so sorry, but all I‚Äôm saying is that it takes a lot to impress us when it comes to flowers. We bought an all-inclusive ticket and, needless to say, were not disappointed.
We visited both the flower room and the cloud forest and were amazed at the level of care, information and sheer wonder on display there. We also went on the 4d motion ride, which was surprisingly a great little diversion.
Now, with it being one of the main sites to see in Singapore, the Gardens always seem to be busy with a capital ‚ÄòB‚Äô. Be prepared for crowds, but also be prepared for what can only be described as floral fireworks. You owe it to yourselves to see the nightly light shows, everyone.

It‚Äôs it spectacular !!!
The sheer scale and size and wonderment of it is beautiful. We come from Ireland, and though my kids are well travelled they were STILL blown away by it!!!
So was I ! It‚Äôs hard not too.
It has the two domes, flower dome and cloud dome. For us we preferred the cloud dome as it had mist, height, water, flowers etc.....in an unreal structure!!! The flower dome still impresssive, but just more like really nice gardens, so I‚Äôd visit that one first. . There is more to the Cloud dome.
But the star of the show are The Super trees ... they are FAB -U-LOUS!
We did the sky walk also which is worth doing as you walk up around top of trees on a platform.
The light show is a moment I will cherish forever. We lay on the ground with our kids and looked up and this light show....it was one of those moments where I was telling myself to remember this and I said it also to my daughters. It‚Äôs not something you see everyday that‚Äôs for sure!

If you‚Äôve got any doubts then the Alice in Wonderland themed sculptures should put your mind to rest. If you‚Äôre getting the impression that it‚Äôs solely about Alice, the Hare, and the other characters, then I must say...Nay!
Alice and the crew are just one of several themes. Singapore has done an amazing creative job of bringing a variety of examples of floral ecosystems from around the world all housed under an architectural master piece.

The Flower Gardens is huge! One could spend hours exploring and losing yourself in the organic fantasy sculptures. During the Christmas/New Year holiday season there‚Äôs an entire display dedicated to a secular celebration bathed in lights that will leave no doubts about the beauty and magic of the time of year.

Singapore has a reputation for being hot and humid but that‚Äôs not the case in the climate controlled air conditioning inside the Gardens building, a plus for those of us who are impacted by heat related medical issues.

There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro.

There were throngs of people trying to leave at around 8 with lots more trying to get in via one staircase from the Gardens to the bridge leading to marina Bay Sands through one set of escalators down to the shopping complex. Just imagine the chaos if there was an incident that triggered a stampede.

The show itself was nice but a bit repetitive. We werent told the ODBC skyway was closed at 4 so we would have to come back another day to that. The Flower dome was a bit ordinary but the Cloud Forest was great with fantastic architecture. The Skyway itself was short but we were fortunate to visit during a solar eclipse so spent time up there watching the eclipse. It's certainly unique enough to visit once and tick that off your list.

Then buy tickets to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest if you want and take a stroll to the venue. With a stroller, I recommend the Flower Dome but not the Cloud Forest as the queue for lifts can be long. Then you can stroll to Satay by the Bay to have some satay. It can be really crowded on weekends and public holidays. Then walk to Supertree Grove to watch the night lighting show (please check the time). The show lasts for 15 minutes. If you watch the last show at 8:30pm, please take note that it is very challenging to catch a cab when the show ends. For express taxi in order to avoid queue, you will be charged $30 to Marina Bay Sands, and other destinations $50 which is ridiculous. To avoid that, take a stroll and locate Silver Garden and then cross the link to Marina Bay Sands for Bayfront MRT Station.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 16:09:17.682353

Cloud Forest & Flower Dome:
If you buy tickets for this combo, you‚Äôll able to enjoy it for the whole day. You could also do re entry for both venues. Just make sure to get the re entry stamp at the exit. You‚Äôll spend 45mins to 1 hour minimum at each dome. Remember you can come back to visit these domes for the whole day.

Super Grove Trees:
You will need to get the tickets separately from the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. You‚Äôll spend 45-1 hour here depending on how long you plan your visit. If you‚Äôre shooting a pro photo, it may be longer.

Flora Fantasy:
This is a separate exhibition and no re-entry is allowed. There‚Äôs a 4D Show before you exit. You will spend approximately 45 mins to 1 hour here.

Team Lab showcase:
This is showing currently till March 2020. You will need to ride on the shuttle to get here. You can purchase at the ticket counter for 3 dollars per person. Get a stamp as you are able to ride the shuttle for the whole day.

Tips:
Go early morning so you can enjoy the venues at slow pace without many people.

Go on weekdays if possible. Weekends are usually very crowded. In general, this place is very popular.

Grab Car or take a cab if you can. No need to struggle to get a parking if you‚Äôre driving in the island. This place can be quite competitive to score a parking at peak hour.

If you‚Äôve re entry stamps for Cloud Forest & Flower Dome - you can come back in the evening. You will be able to enjoy TeamLab eggs lights and also the music show at Super Grove Trees.

Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.

At the gardens; barely any lines if you‚Äôre there at 10am.
We bought the pass combined for these attractions with included shuttle (which is so worth it on a hot day). Floral fantasy had the nicest flowers but cloud Forrest was just amazing especially with the mist going. Flower dome was also nice but my least favourite.

Bought separate ticket to the new Supertree observation deck on the first day it was open. don‚Äôt forget to go to the rooftop! Best views in Singapore because you can see the sky deck and super trees, Ferris Wheel and harbour. You don‚Äôt need to do the other Supertree walking path as the views are similar but not as high.

Good selection for lunch at the food hall including gluten free options at the Vietnamese.
We walked back over through marina bay sands and filled in the rest of the afternoon walking around marina bay. A big walking day but a great way to see the area.

We came back that night to watch the super trees light show. It was amazing. You also don‚Äôt need a ticket to enter the park and watch the show. Tip; watch from down amongst the trees themselves!

The flower done was basically the plants we grow in our garden (which are not native to Singapore) and the cloud dome was mildly interesting, but the crowds and wait times put us off. The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee.

My suggestion is to visit there by late afternoon, so that you can finish it after the sunset, during which it is more admirable due to the spectacular lighting decorations.
We were little disappointed in the Flower Dome as apart from few varieties of flowers, rest everything was just green and green and lots of varieties of cactus. Nevertheless it was still good to see all that.
Cloud forest is one thing you can‚Äôt miss. Beautifully made and with a tall man made water fall.
Later in the evening, you can visit the tree groves and if u like can have a walk on the sky bridges which connects the tree groves (OCBC Skywalk).
Ince you finish there, just walk over to the other side towards the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Have a stroll and shop if you like and enjoy the Fountain Show on the river side of the Marina Bay. Two shows daily at 8:00 pm and then 9:00 pm

The other indooor garden is floral fantasy which was decorated for Christmas with every type of poinsettia you could possoibly imagine which came as a bit of a surprise to us!

After the rain stopped we were advised to head to the Supertree grove for the free nightly sound and light show.

So tourist, buy your tickets first.
I wonder the management can do something about ticketing information.

7.30pm light show, best enjoy on the ground, avoid go up to the OCBC skywalk during that time.

The view on the bridge was breath taking, however, the bridge has only 80 people capacity, there are sign to tell tourist keep to 15 minutes stay so others have chance to enjoy the view too.

I was there on 22 Dec 2019, 8:40pm was just a nice slot after the light show.

The floral fantasy had a vast array of beautiful flowers, but it was a short expedition. The animation at the end was great, especially for young children.

The shuttle service is helpful, especially if elderly are travelling but it is manageable to walk from the entrance to the 2 indoor garden areas.

The gardens do allow free access to certain parts, but you have to may for the cloud forest, flower dome and floral fantasy. Shuttle service and OCBC walk also requires payment.

We visited here a couple of times during our recent visit to Singapore, once was not enough. One visit was during the day when we visited the amazing Supertrees Grove and the OCBC Skyway.

We walked by the Dragonfly Lake and then crossed the Dragonfly Bridge into the Supertree Grove.

The meadow is a vast expanse of grassland it is 22,000 square metres. It is Singapore's largest outdoor event garden. It is home to a number of statues/sculptures including the Floating Baby.

We did not visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, these are 2 domed enclosures within the Gardens. The metal and glass structures are a feature of Singapore's skyline.

The Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world.

There are a number of other attractions within the Gardens, such as the Silver forest, Golden garden and the Large Floral Clock.

On Tuesday evening 24th October we returned to the Gardens to watch the Garden Rhapsody Show, reviewed separately, admission is free

Cloud dome how refreshing and cool that was the force of the water fall was surprising and amazing, the walk through was well set out going through each section before heading up to the top of the waterfall there was a short wait which we were well informed about before we even entered the dome they said 30 minutes but it was really only 15.

We did the sky walk at night after the first light show, though I hate heights it was a view not to be missed, they limit the numbers on it and you have between 15-30 minutes to complete the walk giving you plenty of time to snap some amazing photos.

1. There is a free outdoor water park for kids. Swimsuits are not compulsory (but recommended) Remember to bring along a change of clothes so they can enjoy it!
2. The lunch options are not great, with limited places and a huge crowd forming long queues all the time. Pack some snacks for quick bites so the kids don't feel too hungry while you head over to nearby Marina Bay Sands with plenty of options. Or if you are there in the evening, you can bring a picnic mat and stroll over to nearby Marina barrage for a picnic!

A MUST DO whilst in Singapore really, was as reasonable priced as you could expect for Singapore and we spent roughly 3-4 hours there if I remember correctly. The flowers, trees and everything in the gardens are absolutely beautiful and as for the SuperTrees and the show it was absolutely spectacular, really was blown away by it!

It is 100 hectares of lush tropical forest with walkways and water features. There are play parks for kids and designated picnic areas but the main event is the pay to enter attractions namely the misty mountain and floral garden both of which are a must see and worth the entrance fee. In the mountain walk you can see meat eating plants and walk through a corridor of orchids. There a huge waterfall and tropical plants and trees from all around the world. Inside, it is a riot of colors and smells wonderful.
In the floral gardens they already had a Christmas theme set up so you can walk through pine trees to Santa‚Äôs cabin and all the rest of it. Needles to say, it wears packed full of super happy kids!
Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.
A must see.
Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly.

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges.

It was so crowded there was no space and as seen everywhere in Singapore there was no planning or crowd management. They were giving tickets to any number of people creating a fish market and as per review and research it's the case most of times.

Would suggest to book a table at CAfe la ve, you don't have to take the entry ticket of 32 SGD and can actually eat/drink something for that money.

Also such a waste of paper with printing everyone's pic and trying to sell it with no luck, obviously MBS will throw all the pics which were not sold. Again a very bad practice seen all over singapore.

There is no real refreshment stalls and one tacky souvenir shop.

There is NO access to the swimming pool, which is actually what the MBS is famous for, it is only for hotel guests, even hotel guests visitors can not access it.

Save your money and go on the Singapore Flyer (wheel) which is nearby. You will get a much better view of the city, albeit another $10 or $15 more.

So do not waste your money at the Skypark.

Incidentally, we live in Singapore and have stayed at the hotel, the pool is not all it is cracked up to be anyway, my wife has also visited the skypark and said it was a waste of money.
We take all visitors on the Flyer, this is the best way to get a view of Singapore and pick out places of interest to visit later.

For an extra ¬£2 we all enjoyed a fabulous cocktail with a much better atmosphere and incredible views. For the same price there were people just walking around a plain observation deck!!!

The skypark is at one end and wasn‚Äôt that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.

We then decided to have something to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the skypark, but were informed that we could not enter the restaurant from the skydeck and would have to leave the skypark via the lift and return to a different level before entering this restaurant. This seemed a little bit odd considering there was an entrance via a couple of stairs from the skydeck. We were also informed that once we left the skypark we would not be able to return. Apparently the operators of the 'Skypark' and the adjacent restaurant were not prepared to co-operate, hence the ludicrous decision to prevent people on the skydeck entering the restaurant.

The observation platform is on the 56th floor and is 12,400 metres high and is located on the rooftop of one of the most recognisable and iconic buildings on Singapore's skyline.

The ticket price was 23$SD, however, when purchasing our ticket we received a 15% discount because we were travelling with Singapore Airlines. The actual ticket price was 19.55 $SD, roughly ¬£11 each.

There was no time limit to the length of stay up on the platform, we spend roughly 1 hour up there.

From the observation deck it is possible to see the landmarks and places of interest in Singapore. There were information boards around pointing out the sights. We were able to see, Singapore Flyer, Supertree Grove,The Quays, Science Museum, Merlion and so much more.

While on the platform it was possible to climb the steps to the 57 floor for a brief higher vista. This floor had bar, restaurant and swimming pool, this was for the Sands Hotel guests and those that purchased the package. For us access to the viewing platform was good enough. There was a kiosk there which was charging 4$SD about ¬£2.30 for a can of Coke Cola.

A part from walking around admiring the views there isn't much else to do up there. It is not possible to walk all the way around the observation deck as it did not go all the way around.",10-2019,,2020-01-20 16:17:10.338461

At 9 p.m, standing at Skypark, you can see whole of musical fountain show is performed at Marina Bay. It‚Äôs very nice. But there is one thing that i feel unhappy at here. Gate pass price is expensive, about 25 SGD for one person but they don‚Äôt offer any complimentary drink, even one simple and cheap kind of drinks is mineral water. And they don‚Äôt have any free chair for you can sit. You must sit on the floor if you don‚Äôt want to stand for a long time. If you want to sit on chair, you must come in the restaurant there and pay for drinks.

There are different ticket options so decide what you really want. I.e if you only want to take fantastic photos and get a clear view of the city then get a ticket for the observation platform.

If you simply want to see the views, have a drink and/or something to eat then get the free drink ticket......this does not allow you on the observation platform!!!!

You can obviously still take some good photos from the restaurant areas but they are limited by the deck and it‚Äôs hand railing in some areas as this area is higher and in the middle of the deck.

When you buy your ticket you walk round and you have to get your picture taken which you can get later a copy later on before you get in the lift on the way down from the sky deck.

You are only allowed around a small part of the deck as the restaurant and pool area are only for hotel guests. The views are great from the deck but there isn't much else to do up there. It is greatly overpriced for the experience and is something like 50 SD just for the photo on its own or 80 SD if you want the key ring and something else.

Yes it can be. However not everyone wades to infinity side of pool and stay there for two hours from the best time of the day to soak in an awesome view of the city skyline and Bay between 6pm to nearly 8pm. If you stay at this hotel but do not find time to take a quick plunge, it‚Äôs a real pity as I strongly believe a huge part of your hotel bill is incorporated here. We stayed in a high floor VIP room with balcony and a view on the opposite side, the entire Gardens by the Bay. Good news is you can catch both of these views from the top floor pool area. There‚Äôs a laser light show around 8pm but not much to appreciate as it‚Äôs better viewed from opposite side of the hotel across the Bay. After your pool experience ending 7pm ish, head opposite to Gluttons corner or MakanSutra if you wish to avoid the expensive MBS restaurants, some over rated. From there, aside to catching the laser show, you get to experience all the common famous local cuisine from one place with multiple food hawkers, Bring your own napkins as it‚Äôs not a napkin friendly place for the OCD types!:) There is a hidden rest room at MakanSutra where you could also wash your hands after indulging with crabs and other dishes but you have to ask one of the stall owners to know that little small ‚Äúalley‚Äù to the rest rooms.",03-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 16:19:33.501014

If you stay in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then you should have no problem accessing the sky park or finding it. Getting to it from elsewhere, please make sure you tell the driver that you are visiting the sky park as there is a drop off for both hotel and park although you can get to it from pretty much any entrance, one puts you closer. There are signs to help you navigate to get to it. The lady at the desk/counter where we bought our tickets was very helpful. She even helped us sign up in order to get a percentage off one of our tickets. They also have staff on hand to take your photo so once you are finished with your tour, you have the option of purchasing the photo.

This is the exclusive lift that takes you to the top bar. If you go to the viewing platform that's $25 SGD. The difference is there is no bar at the viewing platform, but amazing views. To go to the bar you get your $22 back via food or drink. So we get to the top with $44 SGD credit for the bar. We order the cheapest beer $16 and a Singapore sling $22 and some bar food, burger sliders $28, paying the difference. There are plenty of places to take pictures, there are two bars and you are welcome to go either side or both. There is no entrance to the pool except for guests but from one of the bars you can see the pool in all its Glory. There is not a lot of shade on the patio so take your hat or shade umbrella. Bottle if champagne starts about $130, wine is about the same. A glass or either is $30. We think it gets dearer as you go up each floor! Highly a brilliant experience. The hotel seemed really busy with guests, I am not sure about room size. There seemed to be three towers with loads of guests and lots of check in check out desks scattered around the ground floor. Well worth the experience and easy to get by bus from harbour town with bus 197. Take plenty of cash or coins because you need the correct money for the bus, it cost SGD $2.20 for two. Our day started when we went by taxi from the Marriott Tang Plaza to the sky rail, sky rail gondola costs a bit but we'll worth the ride, caught the sky rail to Sentosa and went to the Merlion, then SeaWorld, then left Sentosa by monorail to Harbour town which is free. This is a big shopping plaza with everything. We crossed the road out the front to go to the bus station to go to the Marina Bay Hotel.

The only good thing about this hotel is obviously the infinity pool at the top of MBS, as seen by the numerous tourists on the first floor buying access passes to the skypark (they cannot access the pool though, it is for guests only).

The pool was great, but it wasn't like 'OMG!!!!!' great either, but maybe I set my expectations too high to begin with. It did have a nice view and food/drinks were expensive, but unless you're in the adults only pool, you won't get much peace. The other pools are filled with kids with floaties and their parents taking photos of everything.

I'd recommend just purchasing the skypark access ticket instead of staying at MBS. There are higher rated infinity pools than MBS.",05-2019,,2020-01-20 16:21:11.841306

But most people went right for some reason so we went to the bar next to pool on left and there was plenty space and a credit towards your drink. We got 3 cocktails and it cost us $11 total after they deducted the entry fees. There are lounges if you lucky enough to snag one. We did after a while and enjoyed it so much we bought another round of drinks. At one stage during the night there was 2 sofas free so wasn't overcrowded at all. We got there at 7 and a lot of the crowd left around 830 after the light show at marina bay. The area we sat in closed at 10 so everyone had to move to the other bar on right which was packed. I was thinking of not going after reading reviews there. So glad I went.

P.s you could pay $30 for the observation deck but i dont think it's worth it. We walked past it and it's just a platform that extends out from area you are already in enjoying the views from.

There are also reasonable priced restaurants on the bay side of the building at ground level just outside the shopping center.

I could see everyone on the deck felt uncomfortable in the heat, trying to find shade. The Singapore Sling was a tiny plastic cup and very overpriced for the $10 price tag.
