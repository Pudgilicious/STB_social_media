It was totally awesome and my young kids love this place more. Lots of interactive exhibition and don't miss its science show.

,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/weikurk,728573942,24-11-2019,4,Amazed that there’s so much to do,"I probably last visited the Science Centre when I was a primary school kid and was surprised at how much it has changed since! Since our main purpose was to catch the Omni-Theatre show, I was somewhat disappointed to find out that I’d have to wait 2 hours for the next show timing as I was wondering what we’d do to kill time for the next 2 hours. Turns out we didn’t even have enough time to cover more than half of the areas in the science centre! Not only is it a highly educational trip, it is also great fun for the kids. The kids absolutely loved The Great Bear Rainforest show at the Omni-Theatre as well. Will be back for more!",11-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:48.767739

They take so much care to spread knowledge, especially for young kids. Apart from knowledge, there are various fun actives there too. The live performance on tesla machine is something unreal.

,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/hiiong888,710966868,19-09-2019,2,DinoQuest,"Actually we seldom go here (re: science centre), because everytime come here feel that the place is not well maintained and service staff not kid friendly (quite rude)

For this exibition, again first step, we ‘greeted’ by extremely rude staffs. Everytime we ask, they just anyhow answer. Some of them also raise the tone when we don’t quite understand the answer.

Anyway, cut the story short and finally we can buy the ticket and check in.
Right after they scan our ticket, the staff give each of us a tag (with one is faulty!!) and a torchlight to my son. Fyi, i don’t even know if the torchlight is UV light until i shock he on it and point to his face and also his eye. Point to note here : UV light is not for children to play with, eventhough in this exibition is a tool to support but at least the staff need to inform the parents right before they hand the torch to us!!! Not only inform us when we enter briefing room. Fyi too before enter briefing room we need to wait at about 10-20 minutes and during this period i witness with my own eyes that many children play with the torchlight. Pls don’t say if point to the eye just a few second it does not matter. I quite pissed off to listen to this explanation.

Short after briefing finally we can enter the exibition.

We go zone by zone and so far nothing really impress us. When we at the briefing room, my impression is seems our children will become a junior archaeologist that study Dinosaur. But when we come and going through zone by zone seems like the knowledge, display etc about Dinosaur or about archaeologist is very limited.
And also, inside there is one section that suppose to have a demo, but the timing thoughout the day is very very limited. Despite we come during peak hour in the weekend. And during no demo time, the staff only sit and chit chat - ing. I feel even the demo only during specific timing (eventhough i hope for more timing during peak period) at least the staff can do some interaction with the children.

At the end of our journey we can rename our own Dinosaur, colour it and make it 3D at the screen.

Overall, not worth the $$$ for $15/child and $18/ adult for exibition like this.

My sugestion is that this place definitely can educate young children. But year by year i feel that this place (Science Centre Singapore) not well maintained. And the staff also really do not have passion to take care the children visitor and some of them quite disrespectful to the adult guest despite we definitely quite polite to them.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:49.438529

,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Dawitango,693032483,27-07-2019,3,Pricey for what it has,"We were four ( 2 adults +2 kids 5& 7 yes old). Paid SGD 48 for 7 days pass ( you can come & visit the science centre till the last 7th date). It had Science+Butterfly+omni theatre+Dino quest+Laser Maze. With our ticket you can repeat only science. It's pricey for the given contents. Actually we believed that the science should have been free especially for kids and students. I mean having seen gardens by bay and marina bay for free this ought have been as it is educational.

If you try to read & understand the whole thing in the science it'll be tiresome. If some were illustrated either through voice or computerized it would be entertaining and understandable more.

The omni theatre is great but the film we saw was the origin of life so it was beyond the scope of the understanding of my kids, but was cool though.

The butterfly was great but if you already went to the Singapore Zoo, it's by far small area and will not meet your expectations.

The rest are v.good I.e dino quest & laser maze.

If you plan to go there with kids do plan to carry their swimming outfits. There is a mini water park for kids. They'll enjoy it.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:50.200992

,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/KJO74,686911674,05-07-2019,5,Very interactive...,"Our little one (4 years old) had an absolute ball at the Centre. It focus is on providing interactive play for the children, and the big children!

Of note was the Tesla talk and show and the 8k movie! Those in its self is worth the visit.

We spent 4 hours there and all but had to drag our little one out kicking and crying! Yes crying!!

Tip 1: take your children’s swimmers, the water area is a good way to end the day!

Tip 2: if you have been to the butterfly enclosure at the airport it probably worth giving this exhibit a miss...it was not inspiring at all.

Really easy to get there and only a 10 min walk from the train station.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:51.315750
,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/TifKoh,685932940,02-07-2019,3,Not very impressive.,"We arrived at the centre by bus number 335. We took MRT to Jurong East, walked toward the bus interchange. We could take either 335 or 66. Alighted at the 4th bus stop (including the interchange’s as first).

It was a shame that the Laser Maze was under maintenance. We paid for $33 per pax for entry to 5 stations, also included Dino Quest to see the new exhibits (excluding Snow City). We were told to return within 7 days for the Maze, if not, they could give us some souvenirs from the Info Counter. We didn’t plan to return so we collected some pin-badges.

My kids enjoyed the Mirror Maze & the Science of Fear very much. They visited them repeatedly. They also loved the Up Close with Butterflies. They loved to feel the ever-fluttering butterflies above their heads. There was a holder with butterfly information leaflets depicting the species that you could spot in this Station. Very informative. Thank God, a station guard was there to prevent kids from shouting & tourists from pinning the wings of butterflies at their feeding areas. This Station could become crowded, yet I personally liked the most.

Another of my favourite was watching the documentary show at the Omni-theatre. Please note that there are certain time slots and you adhere to it. Be there 10 mins earlier. We sat on the highest level, loved the show about Earth - snow, polar bears, big brown bears, human inhabitants living side by side with them. Pretty exciting & moving in fact. The sound system & lighting were pretty good.

Some foreign students in groups were a little pushy when we spent a little more time maneuvering the exhibits at the electrical & voltage station. Demo of the voltage speed & power wasn’t fantastic, though the lady commentator was very jovial & eloquent.

The fire tornado demo was good, but it was so hot around the cylinder where fire was ragingly spinning within it. We couldn’t bear the heat, we went to scout for the Dino Quest.

The Dino Quest Station had the longest wait & queue of all. The queue snaked all the way to the exterior of the entrance, it was rather warm, so all of us were sweaty! When we got into the exhibit hall, we didn’t find it impressive. Our kids didn’t want to participate in the drawing activities. Those seemed to attract younger children more. There were some interactive games that required us to scan our badges against the screen if we got our answers correct. The hall was very small. We expected more could be felt with our hands. The skeletal system of the Dino’s (T-Rex) was of good size.

McDonalds near the ticketing counter was small & crowded with lunch time crowd. No seats were available. We went further in & ate at Coffee Bee, average food quality & service. Self-service.

We left the centre around 5.30pm. An announcement informing that the centre would be closed at 6pm could be heard over the PA system. The souvenirs weren’t impressive too.

We had a tiring day. Would not consider returning till some spots were properly maintained (they were getting old, very worn out & some were spoilt).",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:51.718568

I m sure they could have done a much better job. It’s not very interactive. It’s good for kids ages 4-10 or 12 maybe. The only good part that I enjoyed was the butterfly arena. They let the butterflies fly around and it’s pretty cool, snow city I found was pretty pricy as you have to buy ticket as well as the rental outfits. For us coming from Canada it was not worth it :)",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:57.564422

The parts that have already been modernised are really great. We spent hours and hours in this place and had the best day with our son. So much to see and learn about.

,1,46,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Porkfloss,679118789,05-06-2019,1,Dino Quest exhibition is very disappointing,"Thee Dino Quest exhibition was held from 1 June to 31 Aug 2019. The o ly reason we visited is because my young kiddos are big fans of dinosaurs.

The exhibition was held at the annexe building of Science Centre (note that its not inside the main hall). The entrance is the registration where every person was issued a themed landyard and a RFID card that is used for some interactive elements in various parts of the exhibition. Note that both items need to be returned and are not given as souvenirs.

The exhibition is divided I to about 7 zones, 2 of which are videos. The exhibits are unfortunately not display of dinosaur fossils or skeletons but just some posters, a few models that can move, some videos amd only very limited dinosaur related items. I only took less than an hour to complete my tour.

Tickets are priced at $18/adult and $15/child and seriously its a ripoff. This is not the first time I visited the Science Centre for such special exhibits and everytime I am disappointed with the experience I derived. This time even my kids (6 and 4 years old) complained that it's boring and lousy.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:31:58.681125

We heard a baby crying at the volcano as the noise the ""explosion"" made was quite loud. The human body was fun, letting the kids slide down a slide and walk through the intestines. When they came out, the human body let out a fart, like they were poop! We went to the earthquake exhibit, which let the kids, who had never experienced an earthquake in their life, learn how it felt like. There was also a wind simulator which showed us how fast the wind was going per km/h . We watched a man perform a show with dry ice and learnt about dry ice.

It was not originally on my to visit list but It was one of the best places to visit. We took the combo ticket with Omni theatre, butterfly dome and science center. The omni theatre had a documentary on the great rainforest bears. The 40 min documentary had us all enthralled with beautiful visuals and the heart warming tale of the spirit bear ( white in colour). We learnt so much of these lovely creatures and their cousins and the efforts of the native Americans to help save these beautiful beings.
The Science center in itself was a great learning experience for all age groups. So many activities and working models. The mirror maze is a must do. The cloud shaper is another excellent exhibit. The kinetic park outside the center has some amazing working models and a small fountain where the young ones can jump around.The activity area can keep the little ones occupied for hours. The staff was extremely polite and helpful. Last but not the least,the butterfly dome was a great way to see butterflies. We saw the crysalis, puppa and adults butterflies. They were sitting on our backpacks. It was so much fun to be up close and personal with them.Lastly, the McDonald's outside the center has an amazing variety of food for young ones.

My 6 and 3 year old kids enjoys the activities offered at kidstop. Expect groups of young school kids visiting the centre if you decide to come during weekdays.

There is a cafe just outside Kidstop. Not much foods apart from some puffs and cakes. There is a Chinese restaurant in the centre itself. However, son and daughter still prefer to have McDonald’s which is located at the far end of the centre. The walk from Kidstop to McDonald’s was shades and stroller friendly.

Kids enjoyed the snow city too! Don’t expect too much from it. My kids, having never experienced snow before, enjoyed them. Slipping and falling on their bums were something they both could not stop laughing about. It’s more of an ice city than now - just like a big freezer. There is 1hr time limit to play in ice city. There are photographers available in the play area - photos need to be bought off them upon checking out.

There is only 1 waiting area at snow city -where my wife and 10months old kid had to wait us. Not the most convenient place to wait - cafeteria setup.

Overall, good place to spend times with your kids. Spent a good 3hours at this place. Kids had fun and that’s most important to me.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:32:06.929308

We previously lived in Singapore about 10 years ago so were keen to see how it had changed and compare it to our local Scitech in Perth. As its quite far from the ""city"" and public buses required walking in the humidity and heat, we took a cab there and back which was costly (~$25 each way). Sadly a lot of the exhibits were unchanged from a decade ago. They were tired and old looking. The only highlight was the butterfly garden and wind fire tunnel. There was a small cafe selling snacks and local fare. We didn't revisit snow city so cannot say whether that has been upgraded. We spent less than 2 hours there.

The Center inside is spacious and welcoming,with lots of exciting and informative exhibits right from the starwt of your journey. There were plentiful exhibits concerning illusions and how our minds perceives them,as well as an exciting simulation that actually lets you experience the force of a earthquake without being in a real one. There was one simulating a tornado too, and we could feel the wind blasting through our hair and faces above impressive speeds of 100km/hr.

There were also sections dedicated to the Earth , as well as Sounds, interactive games to play, Becoming A Scientist for a Day and much more. We also got to experience VR, as if we riding on a roller coaster through different environments, which was a new experience.

We particularly enjoyed the Fear exhibit and the one about how our brains work. Both were very interesting and informative, especially the Fear one which was engaging and certainly an experience not to forget too soon!

In this review I would also like to thank the customer service, particularly Mr Alfred who was very patient and helpful throughout the entire experience. We had unexpectedly lost something in one of the exhibits and was frantic. We were sure it had gone forever, reporting it as lost to customer service. Not only did Mr Alfred followed up with us about the lost item, but also genuinely took the time and liberty to help mail it back to us which was a surprise! (We live in Malaysia, next to Singapore.) Thank you Mr Alfred, your kindness will not be forgotten :) we are immensely grateful and appreciative of your help.

But on Diwali day, we were left disappointed when the 2 guides kept repeatedly told us not to touch them even though we knew we were allowed to based on our past several visits. As a result, my son was very disappointed and we left less than spending 30mins there.
I would like to enquire is there a change in the training on your guides to tell your guests not to hold or touch them. If so, I don't think it is worth to pay $10 admission to see these beautiful butterflies because it is not considered 'up close' anymore.
My son grew to love them and even remembers all their species names. We also breed our own common lime butterflies at home.

My friend and I went to attend the tour under the exhibition named Dialogue with time-Embrace Ageing given by the staffs there. Since our tour is about ageing, our tour guide is actually from pioneers generation that is experiencing the stages ageing which I find it relatable because it is rare to have pioneers giving a tour since they are now experiencing the ageing process. Throughout the whole tour, my friends and I enjoyed ourselves very much and we are grateful to go on a tour conducted by the pioneers generation.

During the tour, we get to experience the ageing process through the hands-on activities & interactive panels such as walking up the staircase with an two 4kg or 2kg weight tied on your leg, opening a door with the shaking effects, hearing problems when answering a phone call etc so as to experience the struggle that the pioneers faced in their daily life and there is an audio area where we can listen to the stories of the pioneers of how they faced ageing process. In all, it is really a good educational and fun tour which I would recommend people to go for when they are visiting the Science Centre!!

Not only that, I love the intangibility services that they provided to us! Their friendliness and enthusiasm really make the tour a wonderful memory for us as they conduct the tour through the bottom of their hearts, telling us interesting facts and sharing of knowledge. Not only that, when we are enjoying the activities there, the tour guides are very helpful as they help us if we needed help such as helping us to tie the 4kg or 2kg weight as we do not know tie and adjust it, how to execute the activity there etc. Also, they go the extra mile by sharing their own personal experiences!

However, this most recent trip was wonderful. yes, this is a bit old now but they have a lot of different activities. top of the list for my daughter was the butterfly experience where she spent a full hour. butterfly places can be boring because, frankly, butterflies are there or they aren't - but in our case, there were enough to make it interesting in a circular exhibit area, available with magnifying glasses for up close viewing. After that, we toured the 'centre' which had a lot of new exhibits, most notably one based on ' fear' which was a lot of fun and indeed educational. inside, you can trace the history of what scared people, but in fun ways, and enjoy more than a few interactive exhibits. Then there is a floor on medical science, the fire demonstration, etc., etc. That said, there were at least several interesting areas which were not working or just a bit neglected - for example, a kids workshop which seemed to have all kinds of things to do but so many broken and no one staffing it. Anyway, the kids seemed to have a good time and the staff were quite helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a trip at least once a year.

We took the MRT back to our hotel and it was pretty straightforward. The station is about a 10 minutes walk and the trains took about 50 minutes.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 10:32:53.115764

It is so informative for learning and experimenting, the kids are attracted to most of the exhibits. The fire tornado, mirror maze are amongst the unique exhibit. I would say this is the best science centre in the region and it is so well maintained and up to date since my first visit back in 80s.

The omni theatre is yet another highlights that even the adults will also be enjoyed. We opt for the Aurora movie and it is so wonderful that one would really feel like sitting under the sky with thousand stars and with the amazing northern lights.

A friend had recommended it highly and since my son (6 years) enjoys science we decided to devote a full day to this attraction. The only problem was that we were quite late in reaching the place (it is located in Jurong East and can take up to an hour from downtown if using public transport). We reached around 12, thankfully there was very little queue at the ticketing and we quickly made it to the main gallery. The exhibits are arranged thematically and are uniformly interactive and informative. It is the interactivity (as in being able to touch, turn, push, talk, play etc.) that made the place interesting (especially for those who may not usually be inclined towards science). A few hours in we realized how big the gallery was, and how little we had actually covered. But nevertheless we took a quick lunch break (at the McD located inside) and went back in to continue. A note of caution for those going in to the Mirror Maze, we made the mistake of spending too much time in there, and as a result i started feeling dizzy and confused (!) after a point and made a quick exit through the emergency doors! We also purchased tickets for the Butterflies Up Close gallery. This is a special section devoted to Butterflies - after a few somewhat boring indoor displays there is an open area where different species of butterflies are bred. There are stands on which they have placed orange pieces, you can touch the juice with your finger tips to attract the butterflies. After some failed attempts, a few different species hopped on to our fingers and these provided for great photo ops and fun. But some visitors were a little more aggressive and were catching the butterflies by their wings and placing them on their children's hair for the purpose of pics, maybe this activity needs better monitoring. Though this is not a must-do, it provided a change of scene and allowed us to spend sometime outdoors. So go only if you really like butterflies (the entry fee for Butterflies Up Close is SGD10 for both adults and children). Back at the Science Centre, we spent more time exploring the other exhibits, and caught an interactive session on planets done by one of the staff, which was pretty engaging. We then moved on to the Tinkering Studio - where children were encouraged to construct their own path for a marble to make its way through a path on the wall. My son got very absorbed in to this activity and was it at it for a long time (and was also somewhat upset that his marble didn't make it all the way through his construction). This and the illusion themed exhibits at the front entrance where his most favourite parts. There were so many others we didn't see, due to the paucity of time. But on the whole, it was a fun-filled and curious day and i have promised to take my son back there the next time we make our way to SG. Will surely plan the next visit better in order to cover more of the exhibits.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 10:33:03.140551

As my niece loves butterflies, we bought tickets for the so-called ""Singapore's First Indoor Butterfly Sanctuary"" (normally $10 per person). When purchasing the tickets, we were ""advised"" that the population of butterflies will not be ""so much"". I was told it used to be over 300, but now, only 100+. I asked the guy, shouldn't the tickets be discounted then? He said yes, we were only paying $8 as part of the package price.

While the Science Centre itself (especially the Mirror Maze) was definitely huge value for money and we did spend several hours there, the same cannot be said of this butterfly exhibition which we had to pay an undeserved separate charge.

When we went in, we were shocked - it was NOTHING like what was shown in the Science centre website. Only 1 butterfly was brought to my niece, with the rest of the butterflies - all black - high up on a net (look at photo attached). My niece was so disappointed and even though she is only 6 years old, she remarked, ""Cheat people's money!""

We could not agree with her more. We were out in less than 15 mins.

Perhaps when the exhibition started in April 2016, it was as vibrant as what the video showed. I am not sure in the past year and a half, how many butterflies have died under the stress and duress of having so many visitors. What we saw today was a sorry sight.

But after 24 years, it brings back fond memories where almost everything looks the same but maintained well.
Lots of things to see, many halls to discover. My one complaint is the exhibits could have more of a reaction after the kids press the buttons. Some of the buttons pushed had little or even dull activations. Kids want to see things light up to keep their attention. Some didnt work at all. The kid in me was disappointed. I suppose it is a lot of work to do on each exhibit and it takes a lot to engage kids nowadays. Especially the iPad generation.
But i have nothing to moan about as it was very good value for money where me and my son as locals paid only $6 for me and $4 for him.
Highlight was that crazy mirror maze, thought itd be easy but was quite a challenge and i got a bit of a panic attack as we went deeper and deeper into it. Had to keep cool for my boy but i was like omg omg omg. We managed to escape. I mean exit. Weirdly, reminded me of my first marriage.

Not much of a line there compared to the ticketing office at the main entrance.

There was another short line to get into the Avengers exhibit. Things were slightly slow but smooth.

Content wise, it looked like an extended edition of the Revenge of Ultron. Snippets of the movie accompanied by more details and background. These were mostly on large TV screens. There isn't much in terms of interactivity. In fact, for those, a number of stations were malfunctioning.

The main point of going for this would probably be the AR experience; to control Ironman's suit. However, the line was moving much too slow. After waiting for an hour, we abandoned the line.

Many of the exhibits didn't work, none of the staff seemed particularly interested, and most of the remaining exhibits were just not that interesting. The whole place has a musty smell, which after a while made me feel quite nauseous.

Don't take children younger than 10 years! The Science Centre should specify the age appropriateness clearly. The fact that they don't, makes it seem like a scam, just to make money!

About the exhibit itself-it's a superbly created walk through but way too cumbersome. Too many things to do-first download an app to enter the exhibition; this takes a good 15 minutes and several tries! Then, upon entering the 'Briefing Room' the 'Training' starts. This is a laborious process-read through all the backstories of all the characters, then complete the assessments in the app and ultimately fight Ultron to be a successful agent. The whole exercise would take a good 2-3 hours if one needs to get value for money.

This appears to be their attempt to keep the entrance fee affordable, if you only intend to visit part of it. However, not knowing what to expect, we end up purchasing all the tickets (except Snow City) and turns out to be quite expensive.

Science Centre:
Not worth visiting, most display exhibition are very old and have not been updated recently. The whole complex is missing its ‘vibrancy and life’. It has potential and the floor space, but being a science centre, it needs to be updated constantly to keep up with the times. Judging by the attendance on a weekend, it is losing its relevance unless a major update is undertaken. Also, to charge an additional $10 pp for each of the butterflies and Human Bodies interactive is expensive.

KidStop:
For parents with toddlers and preschoolers – the kidStop will be entertaining for the kids. It is an indoor playground with a Science Theme. So rather than the normal slides/swings, etc it has sandpit to ‘dig’ fossils, cockpit of an plane, doctor’s office, etc. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed her time there.

The Omni-Theatre is an unique experience as it provides really wide screen (not just left and right, but also above your head) to provide images to your peripheral visions. So, it does feel that you are almost there in the movie, similar concept to IMAX. We watched the movie about the Dinosaurs, quite interesting and educational.

I would rate is a 5 for the kidStop and Omni-Theatre, but deduct 2 points for Science Centre.

HINTS:
Best seating for Omni-Theatre: middle top part of the hall, in the section with lesser seat count.
Purchasing Omni-Theatre and KidStop as a package saves $2 pp. Go during off-peak period where are savings to the admission charges. Off-peak is weekdays outside school holidays.
KidStop open from 9 am - 1.30pm AND reopen again after 2pm. Plan your timing properly for max value.",08-2016,Family,2020-01-30 10:34:07.602722

We went on the first Monday after schools went back and the place was nearly deserted. We literally had it to our selves. I guess this place would get busy at other times.
We were there soon after opening and stayed until it literally closed. Even then we didn't get a chance to see all of it. In fact, while I was elsewhere my husband returned with our two boys and found another large section we'd not even seen the first visit.
There are so many hands on exhibits that our boys were entertained for the whole time. We went through the human body section which was lots of fun but I believe a temporary exhibit. There was also plenty of information for adults. I especially liked the section upstairs on Russell Wallace, contemporary to Charles Darwin.
Honestly, I can't understand why this place wasn't packed as entry is very reasonably prices and it is fantastic. They even have a water play area and separate outdoor play place all based on scientific principles.
The only caveat is the food in the centre. There two little cafes. Both are very reasonably priced, but the food is pretty terrible and I'm not hard to please with food. The coffee was literally undrinkable. But it isn't a problem as there is a McDonalds restaurant at the entrance.
Pretty much the whole place is under cover and air conditioned. It is all wheelchair / stroller accessible. Although on our day the lift to the Wallace exhibit wasn't working so disappointingly mum couldn't see that. But that was just unlucky.

I must really commend the two ladies who have made the balloon show very interesting and entertaining for the kids and adults.

There were also other showcases such as talking about global warming and hands-on workshops like making periscope etc. There was a Math fair at the same time and she had the opportunity to be exposed to the wonders of Mathematics too. It was something new for us.

We didn't manage to cover the whole place as we only had about 2.5 hours there. I would suggest to spend at least half a day to slowly walk through the centre to discover the magic of Science.

Then again, I was quite disappointed that visitors have to buy separate tickets for other exhibitions. If only the tickets could be made more affordable, at least for the residents.

Some of the display are a bit dirty or smelly. It's not something I would try again.

As for Laser Maze, this is a fun experience. I would recommend this to both kids and adults. It is $5 per 2 runs per person. After finishing our 2 runs, we went back to the ticket booth to purchase additional tickets!

What I didn't like is that they had set up the Laser Maze inside the Science Centre, forcing you to purchase entrance tickets to the Science Centre before you can play this game. Makes it quite pricey overall.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 10:34:17.632662

The Science Centre will be diagonally opposite you (try spotting the sphere with 'Science Centre'.

There are loads to do and my kids were very entertained throughput our visit. The science with balloons demo was awesome. The two hosts had great camaraderie and spoke naturally. ..not like they are rattling off some memorised script. You will encounter some vidirirs trying to cut your lines at times but just graciously correct them, queuing up is a very natural act for Singaporeans. If you are not sure where the queue starts, just ask...u will definitely get your answer .cutting in limes are greatly frowned upon and considered an uncouth and selfish act.

1. If you are interested to learn, reach there as early as possible.
2. You don't have much option to rest. So be prepared to walk a lot.
3. There are few on hands experiments conducted in the evening. Ask for it and reach the venue on time.
4. Human Body is another display. You need to buy a ticket to enter it. Buy it. totally worth it!

there are numerous science effects and phenomenons explained in a effective ways throughout the centre.
the tickets are available on the counter at the entry point.
U can reach by the MRT very easily which is a 10 mins walk across the diagonally opposite mall.the bus stop is rigght infront if u wish to take bus from MRT station.

there are different shows for kids like Fire tornedo, tesla coil effects, the light effects show etc.it will be useful to get the show timing first and then plan to go around based these show timing
the experimental exhibits are spread accross u need to spend time on what enthuses you.
The Human body is one of the best i have seen rather the only one. this houses all the organs in huge sizes and expained thru an audio playing inside each chamber. this one is a must.
a good concept and well executed to make kids learn them in an easy way.

The earthquake simulation was something I looked for when I first stepped into the Science Centre again, and I enjoyed it very much.

All the exhibits made me learn something new and refreshed my memory on what I have seen before.

The dialogue on ageing was also very insightful, with activities that simulated real problems that could happen to the body after growing old. The woman who brought us around was also very patient and taught us how to use items at the various zones.

Great to have many updates to the Science Centre in such a short time span, and it is a great place for Singaporeans to spend the day as it is free, just bring along your NRIC!

For example, Phobia2 was closed when I visited even though the website did not indicate so, which was sad because I really enjoyed Phobia2 the previous time I visited.

Admission for the Butterflies Up-Close exhibition is $10 per person. There is a short guided tour which starts at 2.30pm daily. Our tour guide was really friendly and shared information with us, as well as allowed us to try handling chrysalises. However, even if you do not join a guided tour, the exhibition space provides brief write-ups and interactive media. Before entering the live butterfly enclosure, you can pick up a butterfly species identification guide. The enclosure is small but interesting, as there are different butterfly species such as the Common Rose (Singapore’s national butterfly), Great Mormon, Common Lime, Swift Peacock, and The Clipper. You can interact with the butterflies by gently placing your fingers under their front legs. Magnifying glasses and microscopes are available for the curious-minded. You can probably spend half to one hour in the Butterflies Up Close exhibition.

We spent 2 days there this year, and didn’t have time to see everything. Make sure you see the Fire Tornado, 3pm Tuesday to Sunday, it’s awesome. Apart from that, just look around for things which interest you.
There’s a serious lack of places to sit. Upstairs we found just 1 seat! Toilets are easy to find, and, nafurally for Singapore, very clean. Watch out for a small step up as you leave some of the toilets, a real trip hazard.
The café in the centre is great for drinks. Meals are disappointing. We had fish and chips and rosemary chicken. The fish and chicken both lacked flavour. Vegetables were almost non-existent, just a small spoon of coleslaw. On our second visit, we ate in McDonalds (just outside the centre). Nice salad and corn, and tastier meat (and cheaper).

I remember playing with life sized puzzles or hammering a metal plate that will strike the bell at the top.

Discovery zone has also closed. That was a super colourful, fun and interactive place that kids would go to.

One new exhibit that we enjoyed was the typhoon simulator, which you can enter and experience what it would be like.

Of course, sometimes technology makes things more fun! Through some consoles, we could control what happens on this giant screen in the E3 section of Science Centre. That section also has some Oculus Rifts available to play with!
