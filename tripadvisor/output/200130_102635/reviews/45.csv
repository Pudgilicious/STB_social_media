Sengkang pool is closed on Monday so did detour to WWW at the far end of the island 23 minutes drive from central.
Massive complex. Shopping. Eating. Full mini township services. And then a massive waterpark.

A bit expensive. But after local promotions quite OK. Great value for your boys. I deserve a senior discount 55+ because really I am to old for rides.

Torpedo was awesome! So scary for most 8+ year olds. Locked in a vertical coffin. Just like Arnie swartzshnegger in the movie!

Boy happy. Great dad son outing.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:21.946307

Although this water theme park is 15 years old, and definitely requires a refresh, its clean and well maintained. There's food kiosk around the rides but its priced at a premium. The toilet and changing room are spacious, airy and well maintained. There's even a swim wear drying machine, which you have pay $1. What is nice is there are ridea for kids of all ages, including pre-school. I think there about 8 or 9 rides for young kids and teens, but i could be wrong. Opening hours are from 12 to 6pm normal days but the hours are from 10am to 8pm during school holidays. In short, for $22 per adult and $18 for kids, we spent only 4 hours before we decided to call it a day. As for parking, its cheaper parking outside at public carpark if you are spending half a day. Fun and my kids enjoyed themselves.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:22.664324

Lots of different slides to suit all thrill levels, plus a lazy river and wave pool if you just want to chill out. A fun day! Get a cabana - nice shade and fans if it's hot or they have curtains to keep out the rain if it rains!. Plus a safe, towels and water. For 5 of us the cabana special deal worked out only slightly more than if we'd hired towels separately and got water etc.

It's hard to explain but it's basically located at the back of a mall (this was very weird for us kiwis) so afterwards we got food and shopped before waiting for our taxi back to the hotel.

We've been to Wet and Wild Gold Coast and this park is much smaller with less 'big scare'rides but still enough to keep us occupied for a good part of a day (even in heavy rain).",10-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:22.969032

Can walk on bare feet (can be a bit hot) but the surface is not too rough on bare feet.

Can easily spend 4-6 hours here.

Lockers are provided but have to pay for renting them :-(

Good changing rooms are available, nice and clean! With showers.

We visited with 2 kids (age 10-12) who had a great time.

It is a fair bit cheaper than Adventure Cove park on sentose which we also visited. Cant say its less good. It is more open and different from adventure cove, but a great attraction on its own.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:31.433770

This one was far better for ""thrill ride"" slides. It was much less busy than AC on a weekday, as AC required 20-40min waits even on a Friday. Apart from the bigger slides, there were tamer ones for the younger set. Our 8 and 11 year old girls had a great time, though were under the weight limit for the ""Royal Flush"" ride which the wife and I enjoyed a couple of times without the kids - it's quick, but very enjoyable!

WWW is the lesser well known of the waterparks in Singapore (the other being Adventure Cove on Sentosa) and is certainly a lot cheaper (we paid for a Family Ticket & an extra child and it cost $124). The downside is that it is much further out of the city (in fact its out near Changi in Pasir Ris). We went on a Sunday - got there when it opened at 10am and it was fairly empty. Only from 2pm onwards did it start to get busy, that said, we didn't have to wait more than 10 mins for any slide! There are plenty of water slides to go on - yes some have height restrictions, but the park caters for all ages, from toddlers up to the trill seeking adult! There are plenty of benches and deck chairs - we paid for a cabana and although an extra $92, I would certainly recommend it! The food in the park itself is very expensive - however you are allowed out to buy food from the food court at the adjacent mall (and bring back into the park), although the choice is limited to a Food Hall (serving Chinese style rice and noddle dishes), a McDonalds and a Pizza Hut! There are plenty of lockers and changing room/ shower facilities plus a shop that sells swimming stuff and sun cream. We were there for over 6 hours and as a family we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The kids were worn out by the end, it was great fun and we'll certainly do it again. If you are unsure which waterpark to choose, this is the one!",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:32.758992

We went on a weekday it was very quite and we got a very good deal almost 40% less than Adventure Cove. The water park is connected to a mall and is 15min walking distance from Pasir Ris MRT. Very good lockers and changing facilities plus the showers are very nice to specially the kids one. The park has many big slides for thrill seekers a wave pool a Jacuzzi and many play areas for kids which were a huge hit with the little one. The reason we preferred this water park more is because of it open concept its very easy to keep eyes on your kids.

Wild Wild Wet is attached to a mall with tons of eateries, and provides a good shaded area for the family members who prefer to stay indoors.

The faint-hearted can enjoy almost all the rides the other one has; and for the adventurous, there are mega slides that are way above the level provided there.

My son's favorites were the kraken racers, the huge whitewater tubes and the water-slide that is completely dark inside. My favourite was the Shiok river which is basically just an excuse to lie back on an inner tube and relax in tropical singapore for a while.
The setup here is really practical, clean and organised. There are lockers for your clothes, big change-room/shower areas, a shop at the front selling any swimming gear you may have forgotten and the staff will give you a pass out so you can go and get lunch from the attached shopping centre.

-It is not fully operated;Royal Flush one of its thrilling rides was not opened until further notice, which is not anytime soon, it seems.

The deal; S$15 Entry fees only apply to off peak hours, that is, from 13:00 to 19:00 and during weekdays.

In my opinion, this water park is more suitable for teenagers than Advantage Cove.
_____________________________________
What I like about it:

-A lot of rides and short Q, and after 18:00 no Q.

-It's rain policy .For more details check it's web site

-Its easy to get to by MRT then shuttle bus or walk it from Pasir Ris MRT approximately 10-15 minutes.

-I no longer to have concerned not bringing enough coins for the lockers; it's lockers now takes credit card, debit card, and there are 3 sizes of lockers you could rent; grand.

-Little kids have their very own shower cubicles.

-Best of all, it is not a busy water park mainly use by locals.
______________________________________
What don't I like:

-certain part of its park shows signs of wear and tear.

-Water pressure in the women shower was seriously lacking ;you need to run around in the shower to get wet.

-It seems like nobody cleans the toilet Or shower throughout the day ; women's showers and toilets were very dirty ; tissues paper everywhere, hair everywhere totally disgusting. So, don't forget to bring a pair of slippers",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:40.427076

We booked a cabana for 6 adults which was about $100 extra on top of the entrance fees. We were given the 'Coca Cola' cabana. This was situated in a remote area of the park. To get to any slide you had to walk over blazing concrete. There are absolutely no covers over any walking areas. So don't wear anything other then flip flops. Otherwise you will have burnt feet. My son only wears joggers so he gave up after one slide. Sunscreen is a must also if you are a foreigner like us.
Our cabana rental came with 6 towels which were hotel white towels. Not thick nice beach towels. A choice of 6 drinks which consisted of no diet drinks even though the shop sold them. We chose 6 bottles of water. It also came with 'snacks' for 6 adults. We got one small box of chips and one small box of seafood. The seafood was about three deep fried soft shell crabs. One small piece of fish ( how do you divide that up between 6 people, 2 of which are vegetarians ? ) 3 small crumbed things that could have been chicken . I am really not sure. Just really awful. I was so upset I went outside and bought food back in even though they said no outside food. I certainly wouldn't go buy food from the snack bar if this was an example.
The slides themselves were fun.. But the water pressure wasn't much and most of us got stuck. Maybe it was the type of swimwear we had I don't know. But not enough to push us down most slides. The Tsunami wave pool was more like a ripple in a bath tub. And was turned off about every 15 minutes. The river 'rapids' were nothing and all you got was sun burn really...
I do like that there were plenty of life jackets for non swimmers and also life guards etc.
Over all it was a very expensive day for us and I probably wouldn't go again.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:41.996535

Their suggestion for people with poor eyesight was for someone else to lead them around the park. My son was brought to tears, which was upsetting for the whole family.

There are some restrictions, 2 of the children didn't weigh enough to do Royal Flush, which did upset them a bit. There were hardly any queues, the maximum we had to wait was 15 mins for Ular-Lah, otherwise it was 3-4 mins per ride.

A family of three as we were today could not ride anything together. As most rides are two seated or four. Someone always had to sit out.
The rides are weighted for small people. I weigh in at 120kg, (6’4) fit and toned, but was unable to ride some of the slides. This would not have been an issue if all the slides were open. As it was a week day, they alternate between opening of slides to minimise staffing. Which for a paying customer is irritating.
Hired the “bubbles” cabana. The netting was ripped, so we got bitten by some flying insects. Fridge was barely cold.

I saw one young lady refusing to get into the torpedo capsule but the slides are short and not so scary . I did the free fall 3 times and the torpedo 2 times . I find the royal flush fun , especially if you face the flow and see where the tube is going . The heavier the people on the tube harder the flush will be . Slide up is scary if you slide off with your back against the flow as you cannot see where you are going and the slide down is steep
Ularlar is enjoyable and so is the yellow waterworks which is very relaxing . Younger children will love wild wild wet because there are many slides catering to them .",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:27:50.049101

WWW has more rides and variety- ranging from super fast and scary (Free Fall, Torpedo), moderate (Vortex,Ular Lah, Kraken ravers) to lots of slower rides for young children.

We went during off peak (4pm on a Thursday), basically no lines at all. Sadly the Tsunami wave pool was under renovation but there was also a discount on tickets (I think it was 2 for 1 deal- so only paid for adult)

The only disadvantages would probably be WWW is further out in the city but easily accessible by MRT (Pasir Ris) then one stop from the bus terminal.

There are 2 super fast slides with vertical drops, one in a little chamber where he floor falls away, absolutely terrifying but so much fun. The lazy river is lovely and there is a big pool with wave machine. It gets quite deep towards to back, around 2m I believe. But the park has free life vests for all sizes, small children up to adults. Plus he big wave pool has lots of inflatable around to use.

It was bigger and better than we thought. Everything was clean, spanking new and so looks very inviting. Good selection of slides and pools for younger children. Not too crowded- we went twice; once in a school holiday and once on a weekday and they were both fine.

Prices are a lot cheaper than adventure cove. Lazy river is prob not as good because it's shorter and doesn't go through sting ray pools like in adventure cove but all slides are better simply because there's less of a crowd so we did more of them! Food and drinks prices were v reasonable inside but you're allowed to leave and enter so can always go out to McDonald's nearby and bring it in.

It is located at the far East end of Singapore which might be difficult for some who are staying in the central areas to get to. Nearest MRT station is Pasir Ris.

Although a little trek out from our hotel in Pasir Ris the journey on the MRT was great and seeing another part of Singapore outside of downtown was wonderful. Just a short walk from the train station Pasir Ris was also a lovely place to walk through with lovely food stalls and Chinese cuisine.
Wild Wild wet was located conveniently to a mall where we had lunch before the park opened. Also stocked up on snacks and drinks for the day as took advantage of the Cabana package with loungers, fridge, safe, towels, water. Was perfect for our family of 5 with 3 children aged 6 and under. Loads for our 2 year old to enjoy with mini slides and splash parks. My kids loved it. We loved it and were in the water with them all the time. Wonderful memories had and best thing about WWW is that they didn’t try to rip you off on extras like photos and food. Really fabulous and value for money. Worth every penny today and stayed the entire time. Adults got to ride the scary rides but enjoyed the lazy river, wave pool and little slides with kids. Height restrictions spot on. 122cm and above for scary slides which is right. A couple where they can ride with an adult if over 1m. Plenty to enjoy otherwise as I mentioned we stayed the whole time 6 hours and kids cried when we left.

Then inside one whole huge place complete with fountains, slides, climbing gyms and more.
Even for adults there are many great rides. The Vortex, Torpedo and Free Fall as usual is the best as for any park that has similar rides. Even Ular La was a nice family ride. All of us could sit inside the tube and come down twisting and turning. Fun with bumps along the way, but not dangerous for kids. My son luckily met the height mark.

Another plus point, is that unlike many other parks, you wont have to buy food from the inside places. They allow you to go out and buy. There is Mcdonalds and other cafe/fast food. So go out buy, bring in and enjoy.",06-2018,Family,2020-01-30 10:28:08.146878

The kids play areas are great (there is a younger toddler-friendly one nearer the entrance & an older kids bigger play area further in with at least 5 different slides)
Our young ones independently navigated their way around the latter play area effortlessly. Lots of the adults also loved the huge bucket of water that would tip and fall on the waiting people- pressure and impact is strong so kids under 6 need to be supervised or they will topple over or freak out)

We enjoyed the Lazy River and floats and life jackets are plentiful.

Tsunami was not very scary- just gentle waves in my opinion.

Food is a bit overpriced but you can always exit the park for other selections which you can bring into the park upon reentry.

I had the opportunity to bring my 2 pre-teen boys during the June school holidays. It opens at around 10am during the school holidays (they call it the Peak period).

Bought their family combo - $92 (3 adults and 1 child below 13 years old). They usually have promo prices during school holidays - be sure to ask. If u are an NTUC card members, they have different prices for u too.

If u are not the swimmer-parents (like me & hubby), go to the office which is situated near the boarding gates and rent a tent (cavana). It costs u $80 (for whole day rent under NTUC card; normal peak price is $90). It can fit 4 persons. It has a fridge; 2 2-seater sofa, a lazy seat and a big float. U will be given 4 towels which u need to send back aft ur stay.

They also have a 6-persons tent which costs around $110 for peak period (NTUC card price).

Both offers comes with snacks like hot wings and fries (with can drinks), and u can request for the time to be served.

The kids enjoyed different pools; from baby pools, lazy river to ooo-la-la and jacuzzi.

Muslim patrons can go out of the Wild Wild Wet to do their prayers at E-hub musollas and re-enter the place again.

My elder girl prefered those adventurous attraction but my younger girl will go for those kiddy attractions. It is great that the krazen racer allows kids with height above 110cm so my younger gal got to try it as she couldnt do it at legoland (the attraction with similar nature). But to qualify, the one at legoland is also higher. Hence i can understand the difference in height requirement.

As with other water park attractions, my husband and I face similar issues whereby our phone and spec cant be carried with us, so we will need to take turns to play.

1 attraction is quite interesting whereby it allows young kid to bring a float to swirl down (not sure what it is called) but my younger gal definitely love that since she cant play those more challenging attractions.

However, on the other side, I will like to feedback that the shoik! River and Tusunami (wave pool) flooring are all concrete and not sand. hence it is quite easy to get hurt. My hubby hurt himself quite badly when he was at Tsunnami.

We came a few years ago and did not enjoy it then but one of our kids mentioned it had been renovated so we thought to give it a chance.... mistake!

Should have known from the initial queue that it wasn't any better managed, people busy trying to upgrade you to annual pass whilst only 2 team members processed the guests.. must say the 3 management looking on with crossed arms helped..

Inside the park there are several new slides but one was not open, others had no mats to be able to use (cage full of them but no way to get to them?!) long queues due to limited equipment and it generally seemed like no one was working or cared..

The whole ascetics of the place is bad, no planting or even upkeep of the park as the old elements where not even repainted

The attitude of the staff was shocking, some clearly did not understand English whilst others we just plain rude, similar to below with angry uncle scolding children for being excited.. to be honest it was embarrassing in front of friends to show them this sort of welcome at what is meant to be a fun park

We left shortly afterwards and we're happy to do so as you walked back through tables in front of the cafe overflowing with leftover food and plates being eaten by birds

Do not recommend

My all time favourite is still the Ular-lah. It suits even the faint-hearted but is still exciting enough to make all wants to go for a second round.

A new ride which is Asia' first hybrid ride featuring both the Behemoth BOWL40 and TornadoWAVE (I have gotten this info from Wild Wild Wet website). It really made me scream my lungs out on my first try. I went another 2 more rounds after that. It is actually quite slow at first and then there is a steep drop and then a big twist (the scariest parts of the ride). It will be better if the initial part is slightly faster. Anyway, thumb up!

There is a limited time Woosh which is Singapore’s Longest Inflatable Freestyle Water Slide. It is only available in Jun and Jul 2017. Open during school holiday, public holiday and Fri to Sun. Hmm, nothing special about. It is just a long slide.

Water playground is fun but some slides are closed. Don't know why? No enough of floats and life jackets. Until almost closing time then able to find.
But the worst one is the locker's system. Some machines can pay by nets, but some machine cannot. Some machines can only pay for small lockers, not big lockers. I need a big locker to put our belonging for 4 paxs. No changes given. Even is NTUC member also pay under the rate of a non-member. If want to go back to the previous page, still need about 30 seconds to log out. I took my cash, nets and NTUC card about 10 times from my purse just to find a locker using the machine. I don't have the exact amount, so I want to use nets. But the nets is not working and need to wait to log out from the system again. Then use cash, paying non- member rate because no changes can be given. I almost spent 1/2 hour doing this locker system to put my belonging. Luckily I came with my husband and he brought my children to play first. If I am alone, sorting out how to use the machine for 1/2 hour, my children won't not have the patience to wait and will make me more frustrated figuring out the locker's system. Also the price is not cheap. Cost me $10 for 4 hours. Such expensive price for such a poor system.

Two gripes form me though that I hope the management will take note:
1) I fell down at the kiddo area because the tiles were slippery. I was actually quite shocked that it could be that slippery in an obviously wet attraction. Of course it seemed that the management knew about it with all the rubber mats placed around the kiddo play area. Yet these rubber mats proved to be tripping hazards too when it folded up. I tried looking for staff assistance to pull it flat, but unfortunately, none were in sight.

2) Having towel rentals near the tsunami is a bit of an illogical consequence especially when patrons generally do not carry money with them. At $10 deposit per towel is also ridiculous. I could have made money selling bath towels at half the price at the entrance to the attraction! Hope the management would consider making towel rental easier since it is obviously a need in such a place. To those visiting the place, BRING YOUR TOWELS!",05-2017,Family,2020-01-30 10:28:46.019187

Yep,we went on it again and even though we knew the outcome it was still as frightening the second time around. We tried a few other slides which were tame in comparison to the Torpedo but still fun. We round out the visit with a slide in a inflatable raft down a rather steep ramp with a good white knuckle experience.

Then the next section is lazy river. It was an average experiece there. It requires upkeeping and upgradation for sure.Found the walls were chipped and it wasn't an adventurous experience afterall. After that we went to the main body slides and water park section. Body slides were really good and exciting. Best ride of WWW is Torpedo where you witness a free fall for few seconds. I think torpedo by far is the most exciting part of WWW.
Overall, a good experience and can easily spend 4-5 hours depending on the queue and interest levels of the folks. There is another section still not open. It has lots of body slides and interesting water activities. We could only get a glimpse of it from the height but looked interesting and worth exploring once it opens.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-30 10:28:55.016590

Our admission to Wild Wild Wet was bundled with a D'Resort stay next door, and there are substantial savings to be had with the bundled package if you are visiting the water park daily during a stayacation.

Our comments:

The park’s operating hours during school holidays is 10:00AM to 7PM, and we got to the park 10 minutes after opening hour. Check-in was easy as we already had our tickets, and even if not, and there were also no queues to speak of.

We stayed for about 2 hours, and possibly because it was a weekday albeit also a school holiday, the park didn’t feel crowded. There were plenty of crew on station to keep an eye on things.

The Shiok River was fairly gentle and safe for three year olds in tubes. And if that wasn’t reassuring enough, every 15-20 meters or so stood a park crew equipped with life buoys. The Professor’s Playground is designed for kids, but the large water bucket that was filled and emptied every couple minutes was a big hit for everyone – especially adults.

In all, the park is great, though that some rides were closed was a downer.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 10:29:03.149824

This attraction is going through refurbishment; doubling in size but it is not completed; it would be completed end of this year. However, there were still sufficient rides for my 10 years old and me to hang there till 18:00.

What we like about this attraction:
- If you have forgotten about bring a towel you could rent it for $4 for the public and $3 for D' Resort guests.
-Entrance fees were inexpensive for D'resort guests: $13 for adults and $10 for my son.But for some reason; i was charge $20 in all only...hmmm..no idea why

-Its lockers would take old and new $1 coins only

-There are large and small lockers

-My locker wasn't working ones i put the coins in but it was ok help was just a buzz away; fabulous!

-plenty of eatery immediately outside this attraction , such as, Subway.

- Practically no Q; absolutely fabulous!

-Toilets and showers are clean.By the way, if you don't want one of those push handle shower use the showers at the back where you get a pull handle shower; much better. you would understand what i meant when you use the shower :-)

-There were loungers and they were newish and clean

-There were coin operated drinks dispenser dotted all over this attraction

- You could bring your own food in; have a picnic ; no problem.

- Like their Rain Code policy. Should it rain over 30 minutes resulting you unable to use this attraction your tickets would be stamped ; you would be allow to use your tickets again to enter the attraction again within 60 days .

- We were delighted we did not have to carry the tubes for the Ular Lah; thumbs up!

- Camera is allowed ; thumb up!

-No selfie sticks! thumb up!

What we didn't like:

-the locker, ones you close it to open and close it again it would cost you another $3; that IS an inconvenience not to mention costly

-If you need to change your notes into coins; its coin dispenser only takes $2 notes.

Do take a note:

-This attraction only opens 13:00 to 19:00 during weekdays and 10:00 to 19:00 during weekends

- It has added 6 new rides to its exiting rides but these are NOT up and running at the moment until end of 2016

There were very few visitors and it is perfect for us. We took the rides as many times as we like without having to queue for more than 5 minutes.

The ""Torpedo"" through which you will experience free fall from 4-storey high is pretty interesting. Another interesting one is the ""slide up"". The other rides are very common but my daughter still has a lot of fun! She later befriended another young girl and they went off playing by themselves.

Note:
1 Bring slippers as it is difficult to walk on the pebbled-walk way
2 Do not bring unnecessary valuables as the locker is pay per use.
3 There is not much food available for purchase inside the water park, but it is just next to ""Downtown East"" mall. You are allowed to leave the park for your meal and enter again but ensure you get a stamp on your hand before leaving.

No real surprises but it delivers what it is supposed to - a fun day under the sun. What impressed me the most was that the whole place is so clean and well-maintained - from the crystal clear water to the spotless shower rooms.

We were there from 10am to 2pm on a Sunday, and there were no long queues for the rides. In fact, my 2 teenage boys managed to go for the Ular-la ride a grand total of 7 times! I attribute the lack of queues to a good pricing mechanism. At around S$20 per person (after some merchant discount - normal price S$24 for weekends), it is not exactly cheap, but if it were priced any cheaper, the crowd may come in and spoil the enjoyment. So I would say that it is priced just right. Though the park does have some water features and playground for the very young, I would say that the majority of the waterpark-goers are teenage groups.

Do bring lots of sunblock. I underestimated the severity of the noon sun and was still suffering from the worst sunburn ever even after one week.",04-2016,Family,2020-01-30 10:29:13.984191

Finished less than 2 hours .
Not as crowded as I expected on a public holiday .
Tsunami was a mini one and I regard it as a ""dangerous zone ""since a lot of people even myself got cut on a sharp,rough stone floor inside the pool.Through my observation,either on the elbow ,knee,upper arm and toe/feet.
The whole area ground/floor made of rough stone and lots of small small stone lying on the floor so it's hard to walk barefoot while doing all the rides .
No outside food and drinks but a lot of them brought home food cooked and nothing to eat inside the park except small stall selling hot and cold drinks ,hotdog,nuggets and cheese fries which were quite pricey .No idea whether it can be eaten by all walks of life since I overhead one customer asked the seller about how the food is bring prepared,unfortunately she never answered and no sign on the stall for confirmation or clarification either so it was quite confusing for certain people .
There is a vending machine but pricey too.
I suggest before you decided to keep your stuff inside the lockers please double check since you need to pay again ,in case you would like to buy any food and drinks later .
The toilet/shower pretty small and limited cubicles as You need to queue for a while .
Please dress accordingly as some staff that managed the station rides may stop you if you did not wear accordingly for example bathing suits that has zip at the back since according to them ,it might damaged the slides.
Since the rides are very limited....You might waste your time there because of your attire.
Not much bikinis or Swimming costume seen as most of the ladies,women worn a conservative bathing suits even the men.

First time I was there since 2004 and wow the place looked great. Big clean toilets are a plus.

The cons is the price- we went in under a free pass but I can’t imagine paying $24 for what was offered in the park. Also the flooring was super hot due to the sun esp the royal flush area your feet will BURN. Suggest that more shade is provided in the large open spaces between the rides and add mats on outdoor shower floor or add more places to deposit shoes.

Considering that there is a public waterpark that is very inexpensive (Jurong East Swimming Complex), Wild Wild Wet waterpark is better but not worth the extra cost. The public waterpark will cost you about S$5 for your entry, tube, and locker. This place will cost you about S$25 for entry, tube, locker.

The slides at this place were good. There is stuff available for all ages. As an adult, I found the most advanced slides to be scary. The torpedo is the kind where you're in a chamber and the floor falls out beneath you. It's smooth but you still will get a scrape or a knick. I did it twice and was very nervous both times. Just hold your breath and close your eyes the whole time until you notice you're done. Such a weird feeling.

The other slides are fun. We only did slides and one lap around the lazy river. It took us 2 hours. Lockers are $3 in coins and there is a coin machine it appears. Tubes are free. I'm not a slide enthusiast but these are the smoothest slides I've been on. The seams rarely hit your back. The lazy river is boring and not fun. I really liked the lazy river at Jurong East Swimming Complex. The current is faster and more water sprays.

We went Saturday afternoon at 12:30pm. It wasn't crowded. By the time we left at 3pm, it had longer lines but it was just fine. I bet Sundays are the busiest days though.

If money isn't an issue, this is a fun time for a couple hours. If money is an issue, go to Jurong East Swimming Complex. It's almost as good and entry is like S$2.

Once the new slides open, this will be a fun park and worth the money. It looks like there are about 6 more large slides opening soon and we were told about December 2016.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 10:29:49.795003

If compare with Sentosa's Adventure Cove, this is of much smaller scale but with its own uniqueness. It's still work in progress - you can see some construction going on.

Overall is fun and relaxing, the rides are not scary. Great place for children and fun seekers. When you walk bare footed in the park, becareful of small lose stones like pinching your feet. It's like stepping on small lego bits.

The toilets and showering facilities can easily crowded near to closing time(7pm). So make your way to the toilet early and there is 2 locations for the toilets. One is the main and the other is made up of shipping containers right at the big pool with the waves.

Food-wise, not much in the park but plenty just at the entrance of the park - the Downtown East shopping mall. You can have fast foods but there used to have a food court near Subway but that entire area was cordoned off for upgrading works.

Overall fun and recommeded for short and simple day out.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 10:29:50.165934

The rides were very ok and semi thrilling. I will say the rides are probably not meant for a +200lbs 6ft American.
The Freefall water slide was probably the only slide i didn’t feel like I was getting slammed on, also for a “drop” slide it was very smooth.

It is a park with myriad of rides/slides for visitors of all ages.
There is a minimum of about 1.2 metres for most of the slides, due to safety concerns.
Families with very young children should take note about the minimum height requirements.

Goggles and watches are not allowed at the slides rides, due to safety consideration of the visitors.

Visitors who wish to try all the rides (slides) need to take note that they have to climb stairs of about 3 to 4 storeys high for most of the rides and some may require you to carry the styrofoam slides (eg: Krakan Racers) or inflated boat up the stairs.

I will advise those elderly visitors with mobility or cardiac issues to refrain from attempting the slides if you have difficulty climbing stairs/experience breathlessness.

There is also locker rental fees of $8.00 per time (unlimited opening and reopening of the same locker till the park closes), which I felt was a bit too expensive.
But it will be necessary if you are visiting the park alone with nobody to assist you with watching of your personal properties.

As of October 2017, only the ""Royal Flush"" ride was not in service due to safety checks and maintenance required.

Worth a visit, if you just want to experience a waterpark with fun slides.

The ""seeing double"" promotion was extreme value-for-money. In my opinion, much more fun and worth it than Adventure Cove. Recommended to go with an even number group, though not necessary.

Tried out Royal Flush, Free Fall and Torpedo this time, and it was certainly an exhilarating experience! Will definitely be back again in future to try out the Vortex and Kraken Racer when they are open. My only grouse was that The Waterworks wasn't open throughout the day, they alternated operations of the two slides before closing it later on. Hopefully both will continue to be open as I didn't get to try one slide during this visit.

Entrance to the park has changed from our last time. We took locker. It is 10 dollar from small and if holding annual pass, 9 dollar.

We started with Kids slides and then Slide up! Slide up was thrill, it is like a free fall, seating in double tube, from a height forming a U. Feels as if you will go all the way and fall from other side. Good slide!

Then we jumped into lazy river. Moved to Kids area. Then we did bigger slides. Torpedo was among the most thrilling. It took time to make my mind. 5.4..3..2..1.. the time inside the chamber builds up the fun.

We took break for snacking. We were 14 people including kids and headed to wave pool. We spent almost 40 mins and thoroughly enjoyed it. It is not big but whatever it is, is enjoyable with family and friends.

It rained heavily towards the evening and the park was closed, we were done by then but check the weather when you are going there to avoid disappointment.

Showers and changing area was clean and big enough. Overall we enjoyed, had a good time. Just one suggestion which we felt that, park can have one more wash-room area. Currently it is near locker room and with kids, you may have to walk a lot many times.

Recommended for locals. For tourists, it is not a very big park. If you love water parks and have sufficient time, you can plan for a half day; not a much though.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:31:17.624092
,1,45,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/keepontravelling88,396653526,25-07-2016,3,Fun place but do be careful,"Fun day out if nothing goes wrong. There are only a few rides but you can do them as many times as you wish. If you have never been to a water park or are not a good swimmer, be sure you know what to do to stay out of trouble. The staff there aren't really paying attention and life guards not that alert. I almost drowned in a shallow pool at the end of a slide because I was pushed under by the gushing water each time I tried to surface. Since I had no idea that it was a shallow pool, I tried to swim instead of stand up. Plus my small size did not help. Had I known, it might have been a less terrifying situation. It doesn't take long to drown if you have no idea what to expect and what to do in a situation and no time to react properly. It would have been different had I been told what to do. But the staff at the start didn't tell me anything even though I told him it was my first time, and the life guard at the end didn't respond.

There is also a tsumani pool which is fun but you can graze your foot badly in that pool. I think alot of people have hurt themselves in here. Do not try to swim until you are well clear of the shallow end because the wave will push you back and you won't realise how far back you have gone, so when you kick your legs next, it will hit the floor as it happened with me. Other than that, it is okay for experienced swimmers and water park goers. For the less adventurous, I suggest going in the river, the jacuzzi, and the Ular-Lar slide.

Only 4 rides were open when we went - 2 flume slides (one open, and one covered), Slide Up and Ular-Lah. We also went in the tsumani pool, jacuzzi and the river. You may want to bring your own towel ($4 to rent plus deposit), water and snacks. It costs $3 for a locker. Each time you open the locker though, you will need another $3 to lock it up so take what you need out before you lock it.

There are too many people on weekend afternoons, so you might want to get there when it just opens or go on a weekday.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:31:23.547247
