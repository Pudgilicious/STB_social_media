The Nike outlet is located within the mall. Not really a big mall but Cold Storage is the anchor tenant here. Can get a bit busy during the weekends, especially the lunch and dinner hours. Starbucks, Long John silver and subway are some of the eateries that you can find here.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-25 21:08:08.482281

Across the road, there's a hawker centre that sells pretty good local food. The anchor tenant of the mall is cold storage. There is also a Nike outlet here which you can find Nike apparel and shoes at discounted prices.

A number of eateries scattered around the mall which features Japanese food, Indian food, etc. There is also Mmmm! which sells good quality meats.
