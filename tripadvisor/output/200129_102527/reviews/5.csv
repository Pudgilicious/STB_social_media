Starting from bottom with broad leaf plants to moss and coniferous at the top.

There are carnivorous plants for display which I saw for the first time ever. At the entrance there is beautiful misty indoor waterfall.

As we move up ,there is better scene of city. However this view does not go well with cloud forest feel.

We chose to get to Gardens by the Bay via MRT which was fuss free. The only thing we weren't prepared for was the amount of walking required.

We bought a ticket that allowed access to both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. So worth it. The Cloud Forest was just stunning. So much opportunities to take photos of the greenery. I was particularly impressed by how many mature trees there were. And how well thought out the layout was. The easiest way to describe it is IKEA - a path that everyone walks through to see the various attractions within e.g waterfall, orchids of the Amazon, the educational displays.

The gift shop was also delightful to visit and the nearby foodcourt was a great way to refuel and recharge.

This is definitely worth a visit and allocate a good day for it. Make sure you are wearing a good pair of shoes (comfortable).

Great value for money.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 11:30:21.667528

The waterfall as you enter was so pretty and just a spectacular sight. Each level sold something new. You first go all the way to the top and work your way down. I loved that every piece or element was about incorporated the environment more into our lives. The planting of the trees in the city as well as how they maintain the Cloud Forest was pretty epic. I am terrified of heights so when it came to walking along the tree path and the cloud path, I was more focused on making it across rather than enjoying the view. My family however loved it. The only downfall is the amount of people they let in at a time. We went when there were a bunch of kids most likely in a field trip and it was frustrating going through a mass group while also attempting to enjoy the sights.

The walk down was a bit scary since it felt like everything was moving and I'm a bit scared of heights, but I would walk it again.

They had lots of plants but you couldn't really see much of them.

I think the vegetation was very nice, but in some instances, the displays weren't as nice as I'd hoped. There were some tall walls of plantings that were impressive until you saw through areas to see walkways and railings. I think that took away from the impact of the plantings. I found it to be much too crowded to enjoy our time in the dome.

In our opinion, it was not worth the cost. We would not visit this again.

We found it difficult to enjoy the exhibits when we were constantly stopping to avoid interfering with selfies or other photo taking. It felt like visitors were more interested in the exhibit as backdrop for photos than in the exhibits themselves. Perhaps they should regulate the flow of people they allow through the exhibit.

I am guessing they are doing this to make the place more child friendly. The crowds however were intolerable. The lift in one of the domes which you have to take in order to access the upper levels was so busy you had a 30 min wait all squashed together as they herded you closer. We decided to leave which was a shame because the tickets aren't cheap but it isn't my idea of fun. The management should think about limiting numbers. Notwithstanding this - i think these are worth visiting because they are impressive - it's just not the enjoyable experience you would like.

Within this attraction is a waterfall, orchid area, secret garden, crystal cave and a short film just as you leave the place and before entering the gift shop. You can also get glimpses of the Marine Bay Sands Hotel and the Supertree Grove.

,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/maryyeo,663356285,03-04-2019,5,Tips to enjoy this Cloud Forest,"We've been here at least five times, and we loved it each time. It contains the tallest man-made indoor waterfall when it was built, that waterfall still stands at about 7-stories high, and what's awesome is that you get to walk INTO and AROUND this waterfall via the sky bridges which kind of wraps around the central waterfall tower. It's a pretty normal building within the waterfall, but if you're into stalactites and stalagmites and similar nature's beautiful formations in caves, you'll find a giant collection in there too. What I personally enjoyed most was the secret garden right down at the bottom, it gets all misty and mysterious especially at night. And of course the climate change video --- great environmental lesson for all.

Since we've been here at different times of the year and day, we noticed a pattern and probably some tips to better this place better:

1. Day to come:
During certain weekends and the obvious public holidays, it gets so crowded that you have to queue just to get ONTO the elevator, which is essential since the tour kinda starts top down. Average of a 15-minute queue. If possible, avoid these days.

2. Time to come:
Another way to avoid the crowds is to come in the evenings. They close at 8.30pm so if you can come at 7pm or later, when most other tourists are out having dinner, you'll almost have a whole fantastic cloud forest to your own AND enjoy the misty, chilly conditions, kind of like in a real dense forest. The musical lights show at Supertree Grove is at 7.45pm or 8.45pm, so you could probably plan you itinerary to match those.

3. Other tips
The elevators only bring you to the 6th floor, and you gotta change to another elevator that brings you to the extreme top. This other elevator makes this place pram/stroller/wheelchair friendly. Also, the ""secret garden"" at the bottom seems a little harder to access to. Make sure you don't miss it after the climate change screening. Look out for the signage that points you there.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-29 11:32:52.597906

the efforts of actually imagining and executing the creation of this dome and the recreation of the conditions on tropical mountain tops is actually unbelievable.
this has to be one the best man made wonders.
the cloud mountain being accessible through elevators and then descent through a circular route using escalators. all flora fauns like orchids, anthuriums, ferns , grass etc does seem like you are in a magical illusionary world where time has come to a standstill. all levels have a differently themed garden,
you certainly cannot decide which is the best of the lot, lost world,cavern,waterfall view,crystal mountain gallery, theatre or the secret garden.

We went with the intention of going to the Tree skywalk but unfortunately got there 5mins too late. However the Flower Garden and Cloud Forest we’re still open. The operator at the ticket counter said they would highly recommend the Cloud Forest so not knowing what is was or what is was about we gave it a go! And it was probably my most favorite thing about our trip!

This is something you can enjoy solo, with friends, family or a romantic spot to visit as couple. Be immersed by all the levels to explore the beauty of the gardens and waterfall and the sky walking track. We had a pram with us and was no problems getting around. We went at night as advised for the visual with lights but also as it’s cooler. We had such a great time!

Next time I would have gone earlier around 6pm to fit both the tree walk and the cloud Forest. Cloud Forest is about $28 and I believe tree walk is $9. So depending on your budget you may choose only the tree walk but allow plenty of time to enjoy it.

There is a taxi bay out front of Gardens by the Bay for easy drop off/pick up. And McDonald’s and a cafe for food/drinks and bathrooms. And views of Marina Bay Sands. So if your not staying there you can view the hotel lit up at night from the venue.

lifestyle and care for the environment through their displays, yet their gift shops freely gave away plastic bags to customers, packaged most things in plastic.
The eateries around on premises served food in single use plastic.

There's a miniature waterfall as well. Spring Garden or something by the name of it is a recent addition to the dome.

There's a show also that talks about the need to conserve environment, in addition to a gallery showcasing the harmful effects of climate change and human predication on the earth. Quite scary, actually. It reminds each and every tourist-local alike to be a responsible citizen and person.

The whole thing is built on reclaimed land, but they've re-created the high mountain forest environment that is rapidly disappearing from planet earth as a consequence of our obsession with ""cheap"" fossil fuel.

The artificial waterfall creates a high mist environment that mimics a rainforest at altitude. Obviously, this is adjacent to the sea, but they've set it up well, and it is prolific with different plants thriving in the moisture rich air, and they've put good information throughout the exhibits so that you get something of an education as you meander around the artificial mini-mountain in the clouds. Really imaginative, and like a live rainforest. The only thing that would make it more authentic would be the leeches you get in a real rainforest :)

We loved it.

You need a real camera if you want to take photos. Smart phones fall short because the light is way too bright for their feeble flashes to fill a close subject surrounded by super bright light.",09-2018,Family,2020-01-29 11:35:56.816022

The outdoor ""trees"" i find quite underwhelming at daytime, where they indeed appear as steel trees - or better cones - only. They do come to life more at night with lighting.

We entered the cloud forest dome first. How refreshing it was. Not just because of the waterfall right at the entrance but because of the really fresh climate in the dome.

The walk brings you up to the top of the mountain via lifts and you wlak down you way through the different areas.

You will have nice and varying views on the way down and lovers of - here predomiantly green - nature will enjoy. So did i / we!

While it is a nice experience, it is after all - only? - a large greenhouse, well designed and well marketed and i personally prefer Kew Gardens Palmhouse in Londeon or the Palmegarten Greenhouse in Frankfurt / Main. It was a nice experience but no reason for so much hype - a clear case of form over function. The form is very nice indeed though!

Located in the Garden by The Bay, it is a place you have to go when you are in Singapore.

How to get here?
Cloud forest is one of the conservatory that Garden by The Bay have. To reach here, you can choose Bayfront MRT station as your destination (same destination with Marina Bay Sands). It was a clear direction in the exit. So you can easily find the way to get here.
Personally, I recommend you to use shuttle service which takes
SGD 3 per passenger (no fee for my 2 y.o child). Because it will be so hard to to walk in the sunny day by bringing stroller. It also needs more than 15 mins walking. So, shuttle service is the best way. But if you have long time to explore each spot of the Garden by The Bay, it's not a bad choice to walk.

What can be seen here?
You are welcomed by world's tallest indoor waterfall which is very amazing to see. I think this is the best part of Cloud Forest. Cloud forest is surrounded by plants which very beautiful to see.
Your experience will be started in the top platform : Lost World. You can access lift or escalator on each level which have their each view. So easy to whom bringing baby.
Cloud walk is a platform to wrap the artificial mountain. Tree top walk almost the same but it is in a lower level.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Go in the morning before sun is shining to high. After reaching here, don't worry about the weather because it is a fully air conditioned area.

What is the best outfit?
Wear an outift which comfort you. Casual is the suitable outfit. Because again, you need to walk more here.

Admission
In the official website, the admission is
- SGD 28 for adult
- SGD 15 (3-12 y.o)
- Free for kids under 3 y.o
(The admission for 2 conservatories, incl Flower Dome)

Opening hours
9 am - 9 pm daily

You would need at least an hour in the conservatory, to wind your way up the path from the ground level entrance, all the way up to the top of the 'mountain'. The Cloud Forest boasts the largest man-made waterfall and it really is Spectacular! The pathway enables you to gradually make your way to the top of the falls, where you look out onto an amazing vista. There are alternate pathways for those not keen on heights.
The plants, creepers, ferns and flowers change in nature the higher you go, just as they do in the rain forests. And the curators have very intelligently made use of LEGO amongst the plants (on the top level) to substantiate the lush growth. This is not a contrived look at all.
We believe it's a must-see during your visit to Singapore.

Worth visting for an afternoon, but avoid the weekends when there are crowds.
Cloud Forest is a domed environment, where there is a central pillar representing the tree.
When you enter the dome you see the central pillar rising up. Inside the pillar, there are various exhibits and walkways, so you are directed to the top of the piller (about 7 stories) and you walk your way down the pillar and enjoy the excellent views, forest flora and waterfalls.
The environment is air conditioned and cool, but the walk is pretty long and there are not many places to sit (if any)
Also there are no refreshments or shops (until the very end) so you will be spending 1-2 hours on a hike, although it is a very easy hike with lots to see along the way, including some walkways that jut out from the central pillar.

There are lifts to the top, but there may be a queue, if you have no problems climbing stairs, you can climb the 7 stories to the top.
Bring a camera and breathe in the fresh air!

,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Xavier722013,573610154,16-04-2018,3,An Orwellian experience,"Having taken my 11 and 13-year-old boy and girl to visit, I was struck by a number of things: the first one, is the absolute masterpiece of both engineering and architecture that went into the creation of the domes. Nobody can deny that this is human ingenuity at its best. The flora specimens are astounding and truly representative of both the tropical and alpine / northern climates (each one is housed in the different dome). The water that is used to irrigate the plants various specimens, is all produced there, and a great deal of thought has been put into creating, designing and executing the two domes.

However, for me and my family there was a rather sinister and at the same time disappointing angle to this whole experience. Let me explain: As we walked through the different domes, you couldn’t help but notice for example Europeans being fascinated by tropical flora and Asians astounded by Northern European flowers such us an edelweiss or blue bells. Naturally, for each one of us, where we grew up is what we know, and that is what we consider ‘normal’. That we each bring our own paradigm or optic with which we view things is what makes the opportunity to look at different flora important. Yet, it’s rather tragic that we have to go to places like this to experience flora that is slowly becoming extinct, or that we can’t be bothered to take care of. Our family reflection was one of slight sadness thinking how dangerous it is that we are developing places like this where we “artificially” create these environments. More troubling however for me, was the fact that the Singaporean owners, make no reference about the importance of taking care of different flora, but simply flaunt how unique and amazing it is that “they” have been able to bring this into the domes. This is a hugely missed opportunity to educate our children about the importance of taking care of the environment in the world we live in.

This is a paid area and it is fully air conditioned. Strictly no food and drink inside though there are restrooms inside. Once entered, the path is one way towards the exit so it is not easy to backtrack.

When you enter the dome, you will be greeted by this cool breeze from the waterfall. It is beautiful and breath taking and it is still my favorite part of the whole garden.

As you walk towards the back of the garden, you will take a lift up to the 6th floor (be prepared to queue) and then up 2 flights of stairs to 7th floor (there are lifts, but again, long wait). From the 7th floor, you will walk what they call the cloud path down towards the 5th floor... A lot of photo opportunities and I can't exactly describe the view with words. On one side you will see a towering wall of plants, on the other, you will see the Marina Bay views.

This place is great for you to take a slow stroll though with young children, they may fear the height.

This is a massive greenhouse called the Cloud Forest. We entered this when it was already getting dark, and therefore couldn’t appreciate the flowers as well as we perhaps would have been able to had we reached during daylight hours.

The first sight that greets you when you enter is a high waterfall (the tallest indoor one in the world). From beyond this, elevators rise several stories to the top, bringing you out at the top of the waterfall. Here, once you’ve admired the view from the top, you can start going down—through a series of walkways that coil around the ‘mountain’ that forms the basis of the forest. At each level, there is some explanatory text to show how rainforests survive and what they consist of, what are their features, and so on. More than that, of course, there are the plants and trees themselves. Orchids, especially, are in profusion here.

Among the noteworthy sections in the Cloud Forest are the Crystal Mountain (which showcases crystals, the mining of which is a factor in the decimation of rainforests) and the Secret Garden, which is a recreation of a Jurassic era landscape, including miniature orchids so tiny that they are displayed behind carefully placed magnifying glasses!

The ground floor of Cloud Forest houses a souvenir shop which includes, besides postcards and the like, some very pretty mementoes crafted from flowers and foliage—especially tiny magenta orchids—from the gardens.

The ticket for Cloud Forest is included in the entry fee for the Flower Dome, so hang on to it if you want to see both sights.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-29 11:40:40.648789

I do have to say that you get ushered along the walk way which kind of takes away from the moment of just the simple joy of looking at plants.

Late evening is probably the best time to go here as they turn on the lights which gives a different aura to the flora and fauna there.
The temperature inside is a bit on the cooler side and you might want to get children dressed accordingly.
The first sight you are greeted as soon as you enter is the HUGE waterfall which is simply amazing and a great photo shoot area. They have ramps built around and over the place to give you a feel of different kinds of vegetation across different levels/ heights.

It takes about two hours to see all the levels and enjoy the ambience. I felt that there could have been a little bit more information given about the flora at each level.
Tip: Take the stairs to go to the top of the tower. It's not too much. There is a loooong queue waiting for the elevator. If you took the four (three?) flights of stairs to the top, you would be half way down the tower in the time it takes to wait in the queue.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:43:03.307509

One thing I do not understand, I have visited here many times across the years, and upon visiting this year, I see that extremely bright shining lights have been installed on all bridges and walk ways. At night this used to be a very special place in the dim light/dark - now the lights are so bright that at night time it just feels very... artificial, the mystique and atmosphere, ruined.

6pm - Tour Marina Barrage

The Cloud Forest is a really interesting concept and hosts a wide variety of interesting and beautiful plants that you don't usually see in our climate. The structural build of the entire place is amazing. It doesn't take long to cover the entire area, you can probably complete it in less than 2 hours, but the cool weather in the Cloud Forest may just make you want to stay longer than you need to, that is, if you're not busy marveling at the interesting collection of plants here. It's a great place for anyone to visit, kids or folks.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:43:50.006457

This should sum up my review but I have to write minimum 100 words. So here it goes .. if you are going to the Garden by the Bay, don't miss the Cloud Forest. Many times I felt like I was part of the movie - kind of in a garden in a space ship. This is wonderfully & tastefully built. The walk is wonderful and comfortable. The temperature inside is a bit cold - so you may consider taking an extra cloth - light cardigan/jacket. If I was a citizen of Singapore, I think I would have opted for an annual or life time membership of this forest just so that I can come and sit in this fantasy market whenever I felt like.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:44:42.508212

If I had to choose, this is my preferred dome, simply for it's spectacular ""grandness"". The indoor waterfall is amazing and something I won't forget - like something from the future! Being able to walk up (or lift) and behind the waterfall to the ""Lost World"" at the top was pretty cool. There were so many species there that I'd spent a whole day trekking up Mt Kinabalu in Borneo to see, so it's certainly something to consider if wanting to avoid that trek!

Her reaction was priceless & told me that I had made the right choice in bringing her to view this stunning display.

The facility, as seems to be the trend in Singapore, is devoted in large part to reminding us of the fragility of our planet.

The visitor is greeted by the tallest indoor waterfall I've ever seen, and the displays continue to impress throughout the duration of the visit.

The setup is quite ingenious - an elevator takes the visitor to the top, and during. Gentle walk down to the base many different types of fauna are displayed, along with explanations of their origins and world locales where they are found.

At the end of the visit, there is a very informative, and sobering, film about climate change and the impacts humans are having on the planet in the 21st century. It is a reminder that we use all do our part to protect our home and be good global citizens.

Well…. What do I say for this man made creation; honestly words would fall short to explain this creation. Have also attached some photographs which I have taken during my visit, correlate with my review.
Right from the entrance, the place has been beautifully designed….. you will find some beautiful rock creations. One thing that I liked the most about these rock creations was the huge flat rocks which were polished and kept along the path for the visitors to sit (I hope so).

Once you enter the Cloud Forest, there is a magnificent water fall from a high mountain like structure. The atmosphere is like as if you are 1000 fts above on a mountain covered by clouds and due. It’s just mesmerizing on first contact. Then there are knowledge boards which explain the concept of the cloud forest for a novice like me. They have around seven levels for the visitors to experience (you can travel by walk or elevators). Entire creation is on a mountain like structure in an environment which is artificially controlled to give you the feeling of being present on a cloud forest. This controlled climate also seems to be the ideal climate for the flora which has been brought from across the world.

As you start your ascend to the mountain, one comes across some beautiful plants and flowers. Some of these are absolutely rare or you cannot get to see them anywhere in the world except their original natural habitat. I personally was amazed to see the Carnivorous Plants section. I have read about them, seen them in cartoons or documentaries and even taught about them to my teenage kids but never had an opportunity to see them in person. They turned out to be pretty small than I expected; not more than one to two inches in length and beautiful looking. I wish I had an opportunity to see some insects getting into their trap.

Once you get down, on the lowest level, you find some of the smallest plants and flowers in their Miniature Orchids for which one needs magnifying glasses which they have already installed for the experience. The culminating point of the Cloud Forest is a 5 minutes movie named “+5 Degrees” that educates you about the changes that the earth has seen and will see in the future. It is primarily a warning to we human who are exploiting it to an extent that it will end up destroying us and our very existence.

Once the evening sets in and it’s sufficiently dark, the entrance of the Gardens by the Bay gets to see a gathering of crowd waiting for some show…. As the slow starts, the dark tall artificial trees start getting converted to beautiful structures which are eliminated by lights. This the Light & Sound Show for almost 30 minutes which again does not fil to mesmerizes you into it. I get a little surprised when I see people getting busy recording the show and forget to enjoy the actual effect.

The complex also houses a huge souvenir shop which offers the visitors with a wide range of memorabilia and books to select from.

Gardens by the Bay is a must visit once you are in Singapore and if you are a nature lover. I had spent so much time in the Cloud Forest that I could not visit the other creation the Flower Dome…… may be destiny has kept it for my during my next visit.",05-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:45:52.766668

Both facades are of irregular hyperbolic shape. One glass house is much higher than the other. If the higher one is a mountain, then the other one is a hill. You can also say that they look like giant ocean waves.

The much higher glass house is CLOUD FOREST & the lower one is FLOWER DOME. Together with the SUPER TREE GROVE they form the famous award winning THE GARDENS BY THE BAY.

The CLOUD FOREST occupies 0.8 hectares (2.0 acres) of land. Once you step into it, a 42-metre (138 ft) green mountain with a stunning 35-metre (115 ft) waterfall welcomes you & locks you on site for quite sometime taking pictures.

It is a mountain, the temperature is controlled to that of mountainous & it has a collection of plants that grow on heights between 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) and 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) above sea level.

You can choose to go to the mountain top by elevator, and walk down via a circular walkway. Along the way down you can enjoy being like exactly in a real mountain environment with plants & flowers around you.

For me, half a day is too short to be in CLOUD FOREST alone. You will need another day to visit the FLOWER DOME which is just opposite.",04-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:46:33.226320

Upon alighting in Bayfront MRT it seemed about a 2km walk to the conservatories. Despite the frequent stopping and photo taking on the way the ages were tired of walking. There is a sort of tram ride available for $3/person which will shuttle between conservatories. This was useful especially on the way back.

Based on previous visits I had decided not to go for flower dome as nothing very exciting there. But for people who want to visit both conservatories, quickly finish the flower dome and spend more time in cloud forest. OcBc credit card payment has some promotion for buying tickets. Locals and foreigners ticket pricing is different.

Typical warm and humid atmosphere outside makes the breezy cold weather inside of cloud forest very comfortable. Everyone appreciated and mentioned about it. Generally none wanted to get out.

Artificial water falls and the walk around on 7th floor were really worth watching and walking. Weekend crowding may invite long queues to get into the elevator to 7th floor. However the staff manage them well.

I enjoyed the different mountain views as you walk around the mountain using hanging walkways. You will get to see diverse vegetation and wild flowers that are abundant in tropical highlands.

The cloud forest also makes a good attempt at educating people of the effects of climate change and global warming.

Bring shawl or other clothing to keep you warm as it can get cold inside since the greenhouse's temperature is controlled. You may get a little wet (just a drizzle) when you get really near to the waterfall.

A wonderful refreshing gust of cool air and mist hits you, when you enter to view the world's tallest indoor waterfall.

Highly recommended to visit both conservatories, when you are at Gardens by the Bay.

I have not seen this in other countries.

This conservatory is a cooling respite, for escaping Singapore""s heat and humidity since it is kept at a comfortable indoor temperature of around 23 to 25 degrees celcius.

You take an elevator to the top level which is Lost World.

From there, one can enjoy the tree top wall, whereby you stroll down the exterior winding metallic pathway.

My family has teens and a young school grader.
They all enjoy reading the descriptions on each tree, moss, and even carnivorous plants, on different levels of elevation. A good learning afternoon together.
We do not really like the over-the-top presentation about global warming, though. Should use the space and videos on more lessons on the highlights of the plants per level instead, perhaps. Or to review what we have learned as we went up and down the cloud forest earlier. Just a thought.

We walked slowly and could finish it in about 2-3 hours.

These high expectations may have somewhat coloured my judgement. First off it can get a bit chilly in there, so it might be a could idea to bring a light jumper or jacket. Buying tickets; I bought my tickets as soon as I landed at Changi, from one of the tourist booths. I spent $2 less than the official ticket price of $28 and I saved myself from queuing up. The structure is impressive but that seems about it. The waterfall and the huge variety of plants, makes it a pleasant experience. There are some short films explaining the eco system which are great for the kids and adults alike. As with the Flower Dome I feel one would be better off going to see the Botanical gardens if plantlife is your thing. As for people who suffer from vertigo, the very top of the waterfall is high, but as a person who suffers very badly from vertigo, it is doable, it was a lot worse going up the Marina Sands hotel.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-29 11:49:50.555152

The place is clean and well maintained with friendly staff. The best part of the Cloud Forest is the artificial misting! Do make sure to go visit before the misting times since that's once of the best things you can experience.

Architecturally, the cloud forest is quite unique, As soon as you enter the cloud forest you are greeted by a massive man made waterfall. Here you see people scrambling around like headless chooks, trying to get photos, selfies, etc.I went on a weekend, so it was pretty crowded. After the initial euphoria, you continue along a path lined with endless plants, flowers, wood carvings/statutes of dragons. lions, fairies and LEGO, yes LEGO bricks of all things, and so on. Then you are huddled into a lift that takes you up to the so called ""cloud walk""-basically a bridge that winds it way down the cloud forest. The cloud forest 35-metre-tall mountain is not totally covered in lush vegetation, you can see pipes, metal beams and large gaping holes, After a while it does get monotonous. I soon realize, it is all too artificial, sterile, cold, lacking character and ultimately another touristy attraction meant to rake in your hard earn dollars. It was like a nirvana moment, at least for me. After that I headed straight for the exit. The staff at the exit asked me if I wanted a re-entry stamp, I declined, as the cloud forest will be a one off expedition for me.

We spent about 90 minutes there because we were in a rush to finish before sunset. I recommend starting earlier and spending 3 hours. There is basically a large planted mountain complete with waterfall built inside the dome, with heaps of elevated walkways and amazing plant life. It's Air conditioned which is lovely on a hot day.
We spent S$71 for 2 adults and a 9 year old kid to visit 2 conservatories, this and the flower dome (also highly recommended). Also spent S$9 to catch the shuttle bus from the main gate and S$32 on lunch at McDonald's.
Our plan was the 2 conservatories, then gardens by the bay lightshow at sunset for about half an hour, then walk over to marina bay sands for the 9:30 lightshow. It worked perfectly and I recommend this itinerary. Allow at least 90 minutes per clouds/flowers conservatory, preferably more.
Tips:
1. If it's hot invest in the bus trip from the front gate, $3 per person. If not it's a long walk and you'll melt.
2. There's a great McDonald's restaurant right near the cloud forest, highly recommended and clean.
3. Cloud forest is great on a hot day as its really cool inside (same as flower dome).
4. Do the 2 conservatory trip as the flower done is great also
5. Go to the gardens by the bay light show after that.
6. Charge those camera batteries, you'll want to take hundreds of photos here!
ENJOY!

As you walk deeper you come to a 'Lego' decorated section where you see Pitcher Plants, Venus Fly Traps, Snake Plants etc- the exotic carnivorous plants about which we have only read but now got a chance to see them- live. The varieties of ferns, orchids and anthuriums are just mind boggling.

From 'The Lost World' located at the top of the mountain, as you take the 'Cloud Walk' you engulfed by the clouds. The experience is just beyond words and the view of Marina Bay just splendid. The sculpture of two Bald Eagles just perfect. All this casts a spell which lingers long in your memory.

Cloud Forest is inside a huge fully air conditioned dome covered by thousands of glass panes and the whole structure is without columns.

One can buy tickets for the Cooled Conservatories- 'Flower Dome' & 'Cloud Forest', from the same ticket window, jointly or separately, depending on how long you intend to spend. For nature photographers one day will be too little. Passports not required unless you wish to take audio-guide or a wheelchair or a locker. There are many food outlets outside the Conservatories.

First, there were a lot less people here in the Cloud Forest. There was more space for my daughter to roam around and for us to take in the sights at a more leisurely pace.

It is a bit cooler so do make sure you add an extra layer of clothing for the younger ones. I was fine with just a t-shirt throughout.

I liked the elevated pathways which provided me with different views of the waterfall and outside the dome itself. Perhaps an area of improvement would be to add on more interesting things to do/see within the Cloud Forest.

I guess I would not consider the Cloud Forest as a destination attraction, i.e. making the trip just to see the Cloud Forest. However it does fit in nicely if you were to be at Gardens by the Bay. You can then spend half a day at the Gardens, the Cloud Forest, followed by a short walk to the Marina Barrage to enjoy the open space, and end things off with a meal at Satay by the Bay.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-29 11:54:54.150446

2- we were welcome by the waterfall

3- like the temperature within the dome so it was very comfortable and nice to stroll around

4- There were water fountains near the toilet for one to fill up one's water bottle

5 appreciate the architectural dome

Tips: we bought our tickets from Cebu Travel which comes with tickets for a Singapore River Boat tour, which we feel was better value than buying the tickets onsite.

When you arrive, you would see Garden By The Bay offers its Shuttle service for $3 which was unlimited ;to and back,personally, if you are mobile, you would not need it.

The other dome is known as the Flower Dome and this review will not be complete without reference to the Flower Dome as well.

Firstly, I think I qualify to describe what a mountain forest experience is, after having scaled the Goechala Pass in Sikkim, where I reached 5,000 m high. I also circumvented the Jade Dragon Mountain in Lijian on a mountain bike, climbing from 1,800 m to 3,100 m high on the Jade Dragon Mountain itself.

The Cloud Forest Dome is located in a fully airconditioned glass dome rising several hundred metres high next to the Marina Bay. It mimics the cool temperature that one experiences when located on a high mountain. For those on wheelchairs, no worries! There is a lift that will bring you all the way up to the Cloud where you will slowly descend on a wheelchair-friendly suspended bridge. You will enjoy the different fauna that are planted along the central spine of the Dome. The best part of it is that you don't have to suffer altitude sickness (>3,000 m high) visiting the Cloud Dome.

You will be greeted at the entrance to the Cloud Dome by a towering waterfall and the cool mist of mountain air, as if you were somewhere on top of a mountain. Great photo opportunities for the camera buffs. And selfie sticks are allowed! :)

The Flower Dome is right next to the Cloud Dome and it features fauna and flowers from all the temperate zones. There is an ongoing Lilies feature which is really beautiful. Every few months, the theme changes. The previous theme featured the Japanese Cherry Blossoms.

For anyone, Singaporean or tourist who need a respite from the humidity or rain, the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes will be a welcomed respite.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-29 11:56:06.942028

The entrance / exits are well planned such that you keep strolling from the start and the path will eventually lead you to the exit and you will have covered all parts of what needs to be seen. There are a cafe or two inside and a few restaurants out before the main entrance. But these are rather expensive.

- To rent a trolley for the kids you need an ID card (e.g. passport). The rent costs you 2 SGD.
- There is the Children Garden close by, which you can in any case enter for free. That is basically a big water play area. Bring a towel and some clothes for the kids AND for you. It's fun!

Once entered, you will be greeted by this massive man-made water fall. The temperature at the onset is rather chilly and refreshing compare to just right before the entrance. Great photo location too.

The main idea of the dome is to take the lift up to the top floor and have a walk down via the many sky ramps and bridges. Looking around from the top view, you can see the structure of the man-made waterfall better as well as the view outside of the dome. Clearing each level as you proceed down to the +5 degree/ secret garden, there is a slide show program that shows the water filtration of the place. Which is a good education process.

That was my thoughts as I walked the cloud forest - you just feel small inside this massive man-made forest with the most beautiful vegetation and this towering man-made waterfall spraying over you as you walk in. Then you start your journey, ever so slowly up and round and the various walkways till you reach the top only to find a few more surprises there!

I really wasn't expecting much - I mean it’s a giant greenhouse after all but it is spectacular and worth every minute spent! Not only that it provides welcome relief from the Singapore heat and we found we easily spend 1 1/2 hours in there without realizing it. Make sure you check what times the actual clouds of the cloud forest are switched on and make sure you are at the top when it starts!

Featuring all the flora & fauna from the highlands it's definitely a treat as you take a trail up to the canopy walk accessible by lifts to the TOP & get a bird's eye view of the place. Make your way to the canopy walk via a Long & winding bridge.What I love as well is the mist that comes out every 2 hours in the cloud forest transforming the place into a mystical place. However, I would not recommend this place for people who has vertigo ( fear of heights) because from the TOP you have to take the canopy walk along the bridge & it can be quite an ordeal for people with fear of heights.

There are two climate controlled bio-domes, which keeps a range of plants from all over the world. One dome is the Flower Dome and the other one, the Cloud Forest. It’s an artificial mountain reported to be 35 meters high, inside the dome that replicates the cool, moist conditions on top of tropical mountains between 3,300 to 9,800ft above sea level.

There is an artificial waterfall at the entrance. An elevator takes you to the top level of this indoor mountain, after which you come down circling the mountain through huge skyways.

As you come down, which is called Cloud Walk, you get a very close view of various epiphytes plant species that clad the side of the mountain.

Halfway down, the Crystal Mountain Cave showcases many interesting shapes of real stalactites and stalagmites. It provides an insight into how the continents formed, the age of earth, and the importance of fossils, after which you're taken through the video presentation room, which demonstrates the effect that a 5° C increase in temperature due to climate change is expected to have on mountain-top environments like these.

The Tree Top Walk which is at the bottom of the mountain takes you close to the forest canopy for a spectacular bird’s eye view of the treetops.

Cloud Forest is open daily from 9.00am - 9.00pm and tickets are SG$28, including access to the Flower Dome as well.

There is some very interesting and well presented information about how we as humans are slowly eroding away our resources, warming up the planet and ways we might be able to reduce or reverse some of the damage.

The scale and volume of plant life is mind blowing. One gets the best sense after taking the elevator to the top of the dome, following which one wanders down the ramps through the dome and greenery.

This visit occurred in the middle of the afternoon on a Monday and the Cloud Forest was quite crowded. The admission price for both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are quite substantial. Fortunately we had our attraction passes as part of our Singapore Airlines Holidays stopover package and these provided us with free admission to both of these attractions.
The first thing that you come to after entering the Cloud Forest is the massive indoor waterfall. It is important to be careful where you stand to take your photographs as if you stand in the wrong spot, you will soon find yourself getting quite wet. We found it difficult to get good photos as it was relatively dark with grey clouds overhead and there were many others waiting their turn to pose in front of the waterfall.
If you wish to make the most of your visit to the Cloud Forest, there is a substantial amount of walking to be done up inclined and winding walkways. You can make it a bit easier on yourself, as we did by using the lift to access some of the walkways at the higher levels.

Then to finish there were a couple movies and though the content was excellent about conservation and climate change, they should have had it showing either in other languages or include sub titles.

Didn't spend time with the stalactites as they were not what we came for but looked interesting but light wasn't good enough for pictures unlike the rest of it.Watch out for the carnivorous Lego.And it's cool, especially when it's hot outside, loads of photo opportunities, and loads of plants, maybe not flowers but interesting plants anyway.",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 12:05:06.007182

So at dawn we went to the entrance and showed them the ticket. They told us its not the final Ticket, we have to go to the lobby of marina bay sands, what was a very long walk after walking through singapore the whole day. Also in the lobby it took a lot of Time to find the right desk to pick up the Tickets. Back at the gardens there was just enough time to run through cloud forest and spend some time at the skywalk.

The way they make you walk your way around then up the waterfall in the elevator then you make your way down in and out of the waterfall is incredible. You think you have finished seeing it but it keeps going, very well done. The flora is great the way it binds to the waterfall. You can get selfies from the bottom and top of the waterfall and other great picks. Take your time as there are many angles to take photos from, but its hard to take in the entire structure only really with your eye as its so high. Check out the carnivorous plants towards the end, very interesting, but watch you don't get eaten;)",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 12:09:42.449538

It is a fantastic sensory overload of amazing and beautiful plants. Some special and rare plants can be seen here, which are generally found in higher elevations in Asia.
I imagine humans settling another planet, like Mars, where we would live under a dome, or underground. The cloud forest gardeners have proven that humans can create an engineered artificial environment, to sustain non-native plant life. When humans are ready to colonize Mars, the expedition should include some of the cloud forest gardeners!
My favorite garden, the pitcher plants (top level) is spoiled by the ugly, tacky display of Legos distributed throughout the planters. Yuck. Please remove these eyesores!

When buying tickets there’s an option to buy a 2 in 1 ticket for this as well as the flower dome. It’s a bit cheaper and can be utilized on 2 separate days within a week of purchase.

The flora and vegetation was amazing. The colours so vibrant. There were some lovely sculptures amongst the plantings.

You can take your time stroll around different area of the replicated forest, browse through some of the world most precious rare plants and spend more time for whatever interesting you the most. This indoor tropical forest structure is an innovative genius, designed to be environmental friendly by connecting the vent-cool system at nearby Supertree Grove where rain water is collected and then recycled to work as venting-cooling-watering functions for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It is an outstanding engineer work runs on sustainable energy to minimize the environmental footprints.

While Flower Dome replicates Mediterranean’s mild cool environment and semi-arid dry climate, provides idea environment to nurture many rare and exotic plants originally from five different continents; on the other hand Cloud Forest represents region’s cool moist mountain climates. Visitors are awe by the skyscraper high of man-made water falls and cool mists rushing down intermittently from top of the Cloud Mountain to keep the place similar to the tropical climates. The man-made Cloud Mountain is the centerpiece of the Cloud Forest where ferns, moss and tropical plants grow on top of other plants; cover the entire surface of the hollowed mountain structure. Visitors can take the elevator to the top of mountain-the Lost World- where you find many small and large intriguing Nepenthes, the insect eating pitcher plants and Venus-fly catchers. On your way down you get the close encounter with the waterfalls from inside walkway of the mountain structure. The Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk provide panorama and close-up views of epiphytes plants and many tropical vegetations growing around the Cloud Mountain. As you loop your ways down from Cloud Walk you will reach the Crystal Mountain where you find exhibits of stalactites, stalagmites and important elements of geological makeup. The Treetop Walk extended from the mountain structure gives visitors closer looks at the makeup of the glass structure and Marina Bay views. Down to the ground level you will find your way to the enchanting Secret Garden, a newly added theme garden replicates tropical cool moist environment of limestone forests and caves. It showcases thousands of moist loving vegetations, rare tiny orchids, small misty falls, and wooden carvings of planet’s creatures on the tree trunks to entertain the viewers. It is one of the top three themed locations (Orchid Garden, Lost World and Secret Garden) I rated in Cloud Forest that is worthy of your time. Inside of the Cloud Forest also showcases region’s exotic flowers and varieties of beautiful orchid blossoms -the Singapore’s national flower. Orchid themed gardens are the most popular places for visitors’ photo ops.

Singapore’s MRT system is an affordable way to get to Bay South Garden. You take CE (yellow Circle Line Marina Bay Extension) or DT (blue Downtown Line) Line and get off at CE1/DT16 Bayfront Station; follow the directions to Gardens by the Bay ticketing office. If you are not Singapore residents you can only buy the standard ticket at SD $28 for adult and 10% discount applies to the Singapore Airlines passengers (just show your boarding pass). Standard ticket covers admissions to both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The park shuttle services are available for SD $3 per person if you want to skip the walks from the ticketing area to the entrance of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can get re-entry permit by having a stamp on you hand when you exit the exhibit building. The visits to the open area of the park is free but access to the Skyway OCBC needs another ticket and only opened when weather is permitted. We didn’t have an opportunity to visit it due to the storm forecast.

I recommend that you spend at least 3-4 hours to visit both conservatories and if time allowed visit other themed gardens in the park too. If you like you can download Plant Explorer App to assist your visits; otherwise the information boards and markers are displayed near the plants. The annual celebratory event is the Singapore Garden Festival. For this year it is held from July 21st-August 3rd.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 12:12:50.535199

The conservatories weren't worth the money or the time.

We went into the Cloud Forest first, waiting 30 minutes to go inside (which we thought was a pretty good waiting time), only to find that when we got inside there was another hour and a half wait to go in the lift to the walkways. We would have missed the light show if we had waiting in line, so decided to just walk around the 'ground floor' which took a grand total of 7 minutes.

We then went into the Flower Conservatory which was fine, but the displays were being changed so most of the flowers/hanging baskets were just on the floor (yet we still paid full price!). Especially not worth it if you're English because you'll find most of the flowers in your garden (minus a palm tree or two).

Regardless, the light show was absolutely stunning and we would absolutely watch this again.

The same thing happened here. Whilst it's undeniably nice to look at, I couldn't help think this place could be improved if the staff would hurl water at you or throw confetti. Perhaps this is something the Singapore tourist board could mull over...

You walk round the ground floor then need to queue for the lift to take you up to the top then you follow the walkway back down again. It was obvious from the long queue barriers that there can often be quite a wait here but we only waited about 5 mins, presumably because of the time of day.

There is a queue inside the dome to take the lift to the top level from which you can walk down. There is a warning for those who don't like heights to avoid walking on the walkway which rings the dome.
Best time to visit: Early morning on a weekday would be my recommendation. If that is not possible, try for the same time on a weekend but with a ticket bought in advance.
Skip the queue: Buy a ticket online (combined with the Flower Dome and skywalk) - depending on which website it has been bought from you will need to redeem it for a physical ticket. I bought mine online and needed to redeem it from the One Drive shop inside the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.

To keep the dome at the right humidy for the exhibits there are ""misting"" sprays at certain times of the day...certainly at noon when we were inside...and below looking up towards the mist is impressive.
The humidy did fog up the camera lens under the skylight filters when we left.

My wife and I have visited Gardens by the Bay several times and we keep coming back. This time it was the Cloud Forest conservatory. As we entered, the breath taking view of the Cloud Mountain and water fall immediately whisked us away into another world.

The cool and comfortable moist conditions contrasted with the warm afternoon that we just left behind. The sound of the water falling, the mild ""mist"" that greeted us and the sight of the 42-metre (I checked the write-up) high Cloud Mountain... we were loving this even before the start of the exploration.

We took the customary welfie at the foot of the waterfall and a slow walk through the ground level. We were absolutely marvelled by the beautifully and carefully crafted mix of flora and plants in full array of colors. The lift at the ground floor took us up 6 floors, where a short climb up a flight of stairs brought us to the peak.

My wife and I joined other enchanted visitors in the slow descend via a circular path, taking time to take in the sights of flowers and plants in close range. The refreshing cool air made the walk an absolute enjoyment. On the way down, there were other attractions (or maybe for some, these were distractions) - such as the display of ""crystal mountain"", the necessary educational display and documentary on climate change...

The romance of the Cloud Forest continued into the ""Secret Garden"" at the basement of the conservatory where garden sculptures and landscapes reached out to lingering visitors reluctant to leave this fantasy world...

Thankfully, the transitory world outside the conservatory was also alluring (apart from the warmer conditions) in its own ways :- the second conservatory ""Flower Dome"", the waterfront gardens, the Skyway for a birdeye's view of Gardens by the Bay, the Supertree Grove, the Children's Garden, and the nearby ""Satay by the Bay"".

Spend the afternoon to explore the entire Gardens by the Bay. Dinner options are plenty, and the beautifully lit Supertree Grove by night is worth the wait. Forget the world and experience the Garden for a few hours... I can only imagine how Garden of Eden might have been like, and Gardens by the Bay gave me a gllimpse of what it might really look and feel like.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 12:16:34.058453

It’s pretty much impossible to take photos due to the amount of people walking around at once, pushing and shoving and standing so nobody can get past, and it’s all just to look at a waterfall, the cloud forest lasts for around 15-20 mins (and that’s only because of the amount of people you have to walk past) which in our opinion wasn’t worth the money we paid.

It's more than just plants though as there is an educational and environmental aspect and every time we visit, we can't help thinking why the human race seems intent on destroying huge tracts of rainforest with the magnificent variety of plants found in such areas.
Take your time as there is so much to see...orchids,pitcher plants, begonias and thousands more varieties. In between the plants there are a number of fascinating sculptures which add a great deal to the overall effect. Gradients are very slight and there is a lift to take you higher up before a gradual descent. From the highest points, there are spectacular views across Singapore.

This huge conservatory is chock full of tropical plants in an amazing jungle setting based on an artificial mountain with multiple catwalks and a big waterfall. What I find most impressive is the way the designers have inserted tonnes of sculptures and other pieces, even lego, but in a very tasteful way, which really breaks up the natural garden aspects without detracting from it being a living garden.

The whole experience is just W-O-W. No description or photo really does it justice -- you have to go see it for yourself.

Tip: There are two domes -- the Cloud Forest, and a Flower Garden. Visit the flower gardens first and then do the Cloud Forest. Trust me -- the order is important. The Flower Dome is amazing -- truly -- but the Cloud Forest just takes your breath away and it's good to end on a ""high note"".

The cloud dome has a spectacular waterfall on entering (so don't bring in anything you don't want to get a little water spray on), and then you walk around the dome and up to a walkway via lifts. Once on the walkway it winds back down to ground level, offering the chance to see all the plants up close.
Although there are lifts for push chairs and wheelchair users the walkways were a little bit harder to navigate for the families we saw with push chairs during our visit, although they completed the dome with no issues.
I had trainers on and found the floor quite slippery, so keep that in mind when choosing footwear. Parts of the walk way you can see down straight to the floor which can also be scary for some.
However none of these things were an issue for us, we loved strolling through the dome and thought the ticket entry was very good value for money.
We saw the rest of the gardens at night (entry is free to the garden area and we watched the free light show) and came back in the day time for the two domes.

Visit during misting times to pass through the atmospheric fog which surrounds the immaculately kept gardens. The walk takes you through the artificial mountain (don't worry, the walk is all downhill after a lift takes you to the summit). There are plenty of Insta worthy spots and at times you have to contend with punters stopping to take that ""perfect"" duck face selfie. There is a hall at the bottom with the obligatory, ""Humans are bad, our earth is dying"" videos, but overall, this is a spectacular place to visit.
Tip - With the amount of moisture in the dome, some areas are quite slippery, especially the crystals area where we witnessed a boy go A over T racing to get to his parents. Be careful!",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 12:21:33.566461

You enter the cloud forest and walk around the bottom floor, then catch a lift to the 6th floor and walk the stairs to the 7th floor (or another lift reserved for elderly or disabled persons). The gardens, plants and sights are stunning. You walk from the top of the canopy down a suspended ramp, working your way back to ground level.

The Cloud Forest was one such attraction. Using our passes, we were able to gain free admission and we were thereby able to enjoy the wonderful displays enclosed within a massive glass and metal structure.
There was quite a deal of walking up curved long walkways to the various levels to take in the views of the various trees, shrubs and plants growing in this artificial environment. The display which we found most appealing was the very large indoor artificial waterfall. Quite spectacular!

- We had never seen anything like this before. We loved every minute we were here.
- DO take the sky-walk it will give you a BRILLIANT views of the city, and across Singapore Bay.
- We took lots of pictures from sky-walk.
- We came at the end of the day so we could see the lights on the trees come on and we stayed to watch the light show which was worth staying for.
- This place requires lots of walking.
- This place is huge and very clean.
- A wonderful experience at a world class attraction.

After all, we had just paid to become Friends of Gardens at the Bay and were anxious to recoup some of our investment.

After entering the CF, the first thing one notices is the impressive artificial waterfall, built seven or eight storeys above the ground level. Everything was wreathed in appropriate vegetation all of which was clearly described in the signage. Take the lift up to the seventh floor and follow the tree top walkway, a little bit scary for those who don't relish heights. Again, clever, impressive and educational, but at the same time artificial and contrived. No birds or other wildlife of any kind, unlike in the real world, but that might be too difficult to incorporate.

On the way out, there is a very good exhibition designed to make one pause for thought on the subject of mankind's destruction of the environment. Then the gift shop and the exit.

When desending you do part by escalator and exit onto another floor now you could easily miss out on part of the tour here as there is an adjoining walkway and unless you look for it you could easily miss it and continue on your descent. Also there is an interesting video on climate change in an area where the projection is on the floor and walls and again we were lucky to pass at the right time to view it otherwise we would have missed it.

,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/RowanH336,484576097,16-05-2017,5,A unique 'must visit' in Singapore,"The cloudforest is one of the three ‘big’ attractions within Singapores iconic ‘gardens by the bay’ – a nature parking spanning 250 acres in central Singapore. The cloudforest has been designed to stimulate mountainous rainforest, with an impressive 7 story central structure covered in rare vegetation and dripping with artificial waterfalls. It is certainly a very impressive and unique structure.

Here are a few things of note for those considering a visit here.
(1) The cloudforest is located in a glass building and has an airconditioning unit that keeps the temperature in the low 20’s. This is very pleasant to provide reprieve from the intense Singapore heat and humidity. It can also serve as a retreat if you are caught in the gardens by the bay during one of singapores daily 1-2 hour long rainshowers.
(2) It is open from 0900 to 2100 so can be visited at any time day or night.
(3) Periodically the sprinklers are turned on to create a ‘mist’ effect.
(4) Although it is free to enter the gardens by the bay, it costs 28 dollars for entry into both the flower dome and the cloudforest. If you are a tourist I would suggest visiting both.
(5) To get here you go on the MRT to bayfront. This is on the yellow line, or otherwise you can transfer from Marina Bay on the red line.

It takes around 1.5 hours to get through the cloudforest. If you are coming here I would suggest combining it with all the other attractions of the gardens by the bay such as the flower dome and supertree groove. The supertree groove is particularly impressive at night with its wonderful flower show at 1945 so coming here in the late afternoon and sticking around for the light show isn’t a bad option.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 12:25:22.642187

The Cloud Forest is one of these incredible attractions that just stop your breath with its incredible simplicity but awesome complexity in equal measure. The structure has no internal upright supports which allow far reaching internal vistas across the amazing space. The floral displays are incredible in their size, beauty and magnificence and there are stunning carved creations which emerge from natural tree stumps dotted around the dome. You become rather blasé but these alone are worth your admission charge. One surprising feature was just how cool it was within the dome. We were expecting exhausting greenhouse heat, however it was very refreshing and at a comfortably pleasant temperature, which was incredibly welcome to escape the unpleasantly soaking heat of Singapore. I'd recommend that you visit the Flower Dome first before the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is fantastic however the Cloud Forest takes you to a new level (literally) and will blow you away.

The nature and waterfalls are beautiful in and of themselves but the sustainable technology that makes it possible is an attraction in and of itself (there's an area before the exit that explains how it's all made possible).

This is a very large space, comprised of many levels, with elevators and escalators. Upon entering you are on a walkway which takes you through interesting plantings and then you come upon an elevator which takes you up to a higher floor. Then gradually you continue to go upward. At the top you can see a water garden with lots of orchids etc., then you enter onto the metal walkway and you are at the very top of the dome.

This walkway enables you to have scenic views of the harbor and some of the Supertree Grove trees outside. It is very high and if you have fear of heights, think twice. Every 2 hours, they do ""misting"" and mist comes out and looks pretty. It took a long time to walk down through the levels. There were gorgeous plants everywhere.

This place is full of marvels, the waterfall on entry is amazing, the sculptures of prehistoric creatures are magnificent, the gardens are gorgeous .... the story behind all of this makes you stop, think and be grateful - but also be afraid if we don't something about our effects on the climate!

It's a relatively easy walk from the Harbour Front MRT or Marina Bay. If you need or prefer there are shuttle buses for a small price. The walking in the Cloud Forest is easy, and there lifts etc for prams and those who require them. The heights might not be fun some, but they've done their best to make it available for all. Price not too bad - we got both observatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) for $28 Singapore $$'s.

It was very striking, particularly when walking in, getting your first view - however it was really just a vertical garden with an areal walkway and some information about the environment.

I enjoyed the walk through, but I think you can knock this attraction out in 30-40 minutes. I felt Flower Dome had far more to look at and photograph - we spent more time in that dome.

A few things to note:
• the temperature is quite cool inside so it's great if you need to escape the Singaporean heat
• if you get too close to the waterfall you can get damp
• if you have difficulty with heights the aerial walkway might be a problem - it's quite high and in places very unnerving (there are points where you can get the elevator back down if you decide it's not for you).

I also think it was extra special going on the 2nd week of December as they where dressed for Christmas. We also booked dinner at IndoChine which is a restaurant positioned at the top of teh nlargest Super Tree in the Super Tree Grove. This was our best highlight during this visit and I would suggest it to any one. You can also have a couple of evening drinks on the roof top bar 1st and watch the sun set with the Marina Bay Sands and city as your back drop ! Again there was a special light show in the Super Tree Grove each evening for Christmas and it was a spectacle in itself - Definitely a MUST DO when in Singapore !,12-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 12:30:52.205314

You learn a lot about the rare cloud forest environment while traversing the thrilling 'round the mountain' path. There are so many beautiful plants and flowers on the spectacular mountain and also some cool woodcraft here and there. It certainly offers a photo opportunity or two.
The hard-hitting climate change video post-walk really hits home after a few hours surrounded by one of natures most diverse, yet fragile creations. A great experience!

It's open from 9am to 9pm and tickets are $28 for adults and $15 for children but that gets you into both the Cloud Forest dome and the Flower dome.
My impressions on walking into the Cloud Forest dome is that it's breathtaking- the first thing you see is the 42m (138ft) foliage covered mountain with a 35m waterfall cascading down its side. The cool mist laden breeze is refreshing after the humidity outside.
The ""Cloud Mountain"" is an intricate seven storey structure completely clad in orchids, ferns, mosses and all manner of greenery. You take a lift up to the top and gradually make your way down a series of ramps and walkways through the various levels. In between the greenery there are a variety of sculptures, which blend naturally with the surrounding vegetation. Starting at the 'Lost World' a pond at the summit of the Cloud Mountain you wind your way down to the 'Secret Garden' at the mountains base. My only disappointment was the 'Crystal Mountain Cave' which has a collection of stalactites and stalagmites cut from natural caves - too artificial, particularly if you've been inside a real cave system. The variety and colourful flowers and orchids is such a natural setting are truely worth seeing.

It is an excellent place to cool off and see native orchids and other non native plants in a 'bio-dome'. At various times of the day, the whole enclosed dome gets a short 'misting' of water which makes it quite a nice experience. It boasts the highest man-made waterfall in Singapore. As part of the experience you walk through the gardens and end up at the top of the structure via elevators and escalators where you can then walk along the outside of the waterfall (but still in the dome) on metal walkways. The walkway is very high up so if you have difficulties with height, you should be warned. You are not forced to go on this walkway (there are 2 levels, top level and mid level which is about tree top height) and there are still plenty of nice plants and flowers to see.

The idea is that it focuses on plants that grow at high altitudes in perma-mist, so every so often they squirt mist in, which is nice.

Worst of all, the guts of the forest tower is filled with random exhibits like a crystal room and at the bottom you get ambushed with an apocalyptic climate-change presentation that makes you feel guilty for even being alive.

Here's an idea - save the planet by not building greenwash monstrosities that masquerade as environmentally friendly do-goodery.

When you enter the dome you are greeted by a towering waterfall that cascades from the top of the mountain. You walk around the base of the mountain until you reach the first entry point of the mountain. There is the lift to the top of the structure, so this is an activity that elderly and less mobile can do. From the top, you walk out on fixed metal walkways that wrap around mountain and take you back in and out as you descend down. Within the base of the mountain there is a short video presentation of causes and effects of global warming on subtropical areas.

Opening Times: 9am - 9pm
Standard Rate - Two Conservatories (Flower Dome & Clod Forest)
Adults: $28
Child (3-12 years old): $15

Standard Rate - One Conservatory (Cloud Forest)
Adult - $16

Local Singapore residents have a cheaper rate.

On entry you will be in awe by the beauty before you and you will be cooled by the sprays from the crashing waterfall. This is a welcome relief on a hot summers day in Singapore.You can walk around the entire structure and there are great vantage points to secure photo's or stop for a while by a mini lake. There is also a resting space to watch a short documentary about cloud forests and saving our planet. You may ponder over the intricacy of the lego garden!
This experience is a feast for your senses. There are so many vibrant colours, levels of flowers, greenery, vertically and horozontally.

The forest presents you with the feeling as a land lost in time, you may wonder if a dinsoaur will come stomping by.

Note: If you dont like heights, you may not like this experience. You can still enjoy the beauty from ground level. You may like to spend 30 mins to an hour in this experience.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 12:34:37.859165

This is a unique experience ! An altitude forest with a waterfall. I found it to be a educational journey.
First of all its reasonably priced and you can combine it with the other nearby attraction or alone. It probably is an hour of my time.

Its a nice walk to the cloud forest through various gardens and bridges which is very scenic. The gardens by the bay is nice.

You start at the top of the waterfall and the follow a interesting path down seeig different plant life that would inhabit hi altitude with information along the way. As you come down the plant life changes and u see different angles of the waterfall and the ""mountain side""

I saw many children enjoying and couples and various ages. As you come to the bottom Theres a factual area a bit like a mini museum dedicated to environmental stats and a fantastic video. It really highlights how we are affecting the planet negitavely and is a massive eye opener.

I think kids will benefit as they are the generations that will make the changes in years to come.
It had a great section showing how the whole area of the gardens by the bay and cloud forest is sustainable showing we can make changes for a better future.

I think this is something everybody needs to see to create awareness of what we are doing to our planet and that we all can act and make changes.

Probably the number one thing i suggest every one do in singapore. An attraction like no other. Fantastic work to create it and sustain and educate us",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 12:35:51.227805

Words can't really do the Cloud Forest justice. The wow factor is definitely there! Strolling along the Cloud Walk (skywalk bridge) surrounded by the mist is a great experience.

Admission fee is 33 SGD for adults, which also gives you access to the nearby Flower Dome. If you plan to visit both you should have your hands full for the next 3-5 hours.

Tips:
If possible, try timing your visit so you can experience one of the mist timings, which start at 10am (lasts for 15-20 minutes) and then every second hour throughout the day.
I would recommend purchasing tickets online and then just bring a printout with you when visiting the Cloud Forest, just to avoid any queues at the ticket office.
Temperatures within Cloud Forest is between 23 to 25 degrees Celsius which feels a bit cold if you've already spent most of the day outdoors, so those who chill easilly might want to bring some extra to wear.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 12:35:58.065705

The temperature drops as soon as you enter, and it actually got quite cold! Most people marvel at the waterfall at the entrance, then start circling around the central structure - all the way up to the top.

There's an elevator that will lift you to the top, and you can choose to walk town to the bottom again while taking in each level. The plants and flora are beautiful and refreshing. There are many, many photo opportunities.

I will say, I'm really happy we went on a Friday (late) afternoon. I expect it gets more crowded at the weekend, and I imagine it may be slightly annoying (as people take tons of photos so you have to wait).

If possible try to time your visit so that you're there for the 'misting'. We were there for the 12 noon one and it adds a somewhat mystical feeling to the place.

Also, try to arrive as close to opening time as possible to beat the crowds. We noticed that as the day progressed the volume of people increased markedly. The Dome is also popular with school groups so you need to have some patience when navigating around the little ones.

Remember also that holders of a Singapore Airlines Boarding Pass get 10% off the price of admission.

IMO they could have made it more green from even inside to give you that feel of a forest. You can hear the waterfall loudly but the inside view is much like a museum and not a forest, just that it is chilling inside. They also start mist every 2 hours, like 2:00 PM then 4:00 PM when you can see the mist coming out from several spots/pipes. Again it could have been more cloudy over here.

You can buy a ticket to just one or to both at the ticket counter. We went into the Gardens By the Bay first which still had Christmas decorations. I reviewed the Gardens By the Bay in a separate review.

This review is for the Cloud Forest dome. As you walk a short distance from the Gardens By the Bay dome to Cloud Forest dome, nothing prepares you for the first sight once you enter the Cloud Forest dome. Your first sight is a waterfall that comes tumbling down from the very top of the plant covered artificial structure to the cement floor in front of you. it is pretty amazing. As you walk around the plant covered artificial structure, you can see walkways at the top and the plant details until you get to an elevator.

Once you get to the top of the dome, you slowly walk around the walkways in a circular manner and enjoy the various orchids and other low light, moisture dependent plants. Photo opportunities are everywhere. You can see the huge Singapore Flyer Ferris wheel and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel through the glass dome.

The Cloud Forest is the most creative and unusual artificial greenhouse I have ever seen. Don't miss it!",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-29 12:40:38.304202

The Cloud Forest Dome was only $14 per adult and the girlfriend and I stayed here for close to 2 hours. It's very educational and teaches you about cloud forests, many different types of flowers, limestone caves and how global warming will affect the planet in the next 100 years.

When we visited it was an extremely hot, humid, grey day, with threatening storms, and so it was lovely to come into this enormous dome and immediately feel cool, thanks in part to the immense waterfall and the constant misting of the plants.

We went up to the top of the ""mountain"" in the lift/elevator, and were amazed when we stepped out and found ourselves in a magical wonderland of misty pools, ferns, pitcher plants, orchids, and other flowers. It is beautifully done and definitely has a ""wow"" factor ... We went down a few levels in the lift and then descended the rest of the way by the aerial walkways, omitting the top one, which is quite frightening if you have a fear of heights (and I wouldn't suggest walking out on the platform which looks rather like a diving board at the top of the ""mountain"" either, unless you don't mind heights.

We went a little late in the night so we were able to see the SuperTrees lit up and the downtown lights as well. Walking through the man-made fog was a nice touch to make you feel like you’re in some hill station (i.e. 2000 metres above sea level). Do go right to the top and go on the suspended walkways.

My one critique is that in the basement on your way out they have a film on the effect of CO2 on global warming and of course they go over the ways ""we"" can help such as driving less,, conserving energy and buying eco friendly things etc. But they DIDN'T mention that the western style diet, high in meat and the resulting intensive farming is one of the biggest CO2 contributors.

GOOD:
* Aircon. If you're in the midst of the Singapore heat, the aircon in here is a Godsend
* Waterfall concept - Weaving in and around the waterfall from top to bottom is really interesting concept, and make it a lot of fun
* Better than the Flower Dome. If you can only go to one, go here

Cloud Mountain was pretty amazing, as soon as you walk in the door you're faced with the massive waterfall. Spend some time just taking that in and get some good photos there, because you won't get a change to come back to that spot after you progress.

You then catch a lift to the top of the mountain and walk down. It's worth going once if you're in the area.

An aerial walkways takes one through the wonders of the jungle of flora and the sounds of different birds make it very real. The Cloud Forest truly becomes a forest in the cloud while walking through the cold mists. The fascinating tropical flowers, unknown wild flowers, plants and flowers from all over the world are growing in their natural atmosphere. Both 'Cloud Forest' and 'Flower Dome' which are adjacent to each other can be viewed together. The couples ticket for both were 52 Singapore dollar.
The tickets can be purchased at the gate but we bought it from airport. At the main entrance of Garden by The Bay, one can purchase ticket for the Golf Car drop and pick up for SG 3.

- lots of good information around the arena about what a cloud forest is
- pretty cool to see the stalactites displays
- very relaxing to enjoy the atmosphere in the cloud forest

Cons:
-I thought it would be better to come in the daytime, so you can see more plants in the daylight, but apart from that, the glowing time at night is pretty entertaining

Tips:
-if you are bringing toddlers, maybe the flower dome is a better choice, it's very slippery and high up.

I would have happily taken stairs instead of waiting for over 30 minutes inside the Cloud Forest to get the lift to the top, but they ushered you into the queue and there was no option to walk up.

There was little to no crowd control / queue management either - lots of people cutting queues and no-one in site to manage the queues.

This time, I was in and out pretty quickly, mainly as I’d seen it before and I’d visited the Botanic Gardens the day before where there was so much more to see - and it’s free at the Botanic Gardens. Even Mount Faber was nice.

Definitely consider buying a ticket that gives you access to a both of the domes and the new attraction Floral Fantasy and a shuttle bus ticket in between the atractions.",07-2019,Solo,2020-01-29 12:43:20.734061

I love their water fall , cold breeze on sunny day and nice plants all around the place.
Singaporen love for Green environment can be felt here at this place.
Usually they have some informative movie lecture at the end of the forest tour .
Great place - again highly recommended for environmental friendly people.

At Cloud Forest, there are also other exhibit and awareness video to watch. We get to understand how human activity impacts the environment and what we can do to save the environment.

Singapore usually has a rather balmy weather but you will leave all far behind once you are inside the complex. Its probably about 15 or 20 degrees cooler indoors.
It has multiple levels with various attractions and walkways with amazing views on the very top floor.
The gardens are so well maintained and seem idyllic, and it entrances you in such a manner that you'd want to grab a cosy spot and just sit all day. (Thats of course if, unlike me, have lots of time and are in no hurry to tick off lists from your itineary)

What it takes to have a 24 hours stop in a city where you’ve never been to?
There are no direct flights from Denpasar Airport to reach Lucknow India and the only option is to transit via Singapore. While waiting for boarding an airline ground staff announced the delay of estimated departure due to late turn around of the same aircraft to be used. It was honestly the worst thing ever he heard that day thinking the short time to spend in the city known for Tagline “Passion Made Possible” .After kicking one’s heels, he finally arrived at Changi Airport (2 hrs and 40 min flight duration) with mixed tickled pink and cold feet at the same time. The Immigration officer asked how many days he intends to stay as Visa allows a maximum period of 30 days with a validity of 2 years, 24 hours maybe sounds good to welcomed him with a smile. In the arrival area there’s a Helpdesk Center to provide details you might need like a map or tourist book and in his case watching some vlogs about this place gave him an idea where to go and that’s to explore “Little India”. He installed “Grab” app instead of taking a cab from the taxi stand surely cost more than bus or trains yet cheaper compare to Taxi’s roaming around. If staying longer then MRT could definitely the best choice of transport considering the fastest and efficient way to get you to most parts of Singapore. He booked Sandpiper Hotel (3 star property), location wise is convenient to markets or shopping centers, local Indian restaurants, Mrt stations, and walkable distance to Little India. Rooms are relatively small yet fair enough for 1 night lodge mostly if travelling alone and if not carrying too much luggage to fit in the space. Wifi is also available, front desk were nice and helpful, still recommendable if not so picky. Dinner was served in Bismillah Biryani Restaurant nearby the hotel. Around 7 pm when the driver came to bring him to Night Safari (he paid 15 SGD for the driver + 47 SGD for the entrance ticket). The timing was perfect as soon as he entered the zoo a live show was ongoing treating everyone with an amazing experience and great fun. The park lightings significantly catch the eye of the visitors to enjoy nocturnal behavior of different animals in the forest which is normally open till 12:30 midnight.

Morning of the next day he decided to have his breakfast in “little India Restaurant” just few steps away from the hotel and get prepared for the half day tour to take him to Marina Bay to see Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Grab app made his life much easier in a click of his finger driver was there, that’s pretty comfortable, isn’t it? Entrance cost SGD 28 (for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome). A magnificent and worthy to visit with its well-maintained nature of greeneries and impeccable architecture of the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. This refreshing mist of waterfall in Cloud Forest that welcomes the tourist gives an instant impression to take you through levels of opportunity to see various tropical kind of plants. And yes, not all comes for free cause if wish to do skywalk or have access to glass domes there would have to pay an additional cost. You don’t need to be a huge flower sucker to deeply get impressed and appreciates the Flower Dome, just get your feet there lay your eyes enjoy the heavenly scent and let it judge on its own. It could’ve been better if not departing in 3 hours unfortunately the driver was already waiting outside to drop him to the Airport. It’s not always about how long you stayed in one place, but how it indulged your spirit and the feeling of being at home is more enough to fall in love with the city

This huge, internally unsupported greenhouse certainly has the clean lines reminiscent of a space craft. It also has such a magnificent, well cared for, unbelievebly complex planting it is totally mind blowing. The man hours it must take to maintain this must be vast. Somehow everything works as does the clear harmony between plants and buildings seen throughout Singapore. Perhaps a model for many other Cities. You don't have to be a botanist or a science geek to appreciate the artistry of this place or the symbolism. There is a statue of a child at the Singapore Botanic Gardens carefully watering a plant.

,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ek_rivera,565657652,10-03-2018,4,A green wonder with a conscience,"Cloud Forest in Singapore's Gardens by the Bay is an eye-opener on so many levels. First off, you're greeted by a roaring waterfall immediately when you enter. Cloud Forest boasts one of the tallest, if not the tallest, indoor waterfalls and its only the beginning to the wonders ahead.

The water cascades down a tower of green, foliage adorning every inch of the multiple-stories tall structure of the Cloud Forest. Following the circling pathway leads you up and through the green and flowers to the tower top from where you can view the head of the waterfall and begin your educational journey down, around, and through the Cloud Forest.

The attraction works on a number of levels: placards give a good deal of information on a mountain's ecosystem and there are more than enough picturesque views and unique flowers and plants to satisfy all needs for pictures and selfies. Plus the cool respite from Singapore's humidity comes as a true blessing. You might consider bringing a light jacket or overshirt as the temperature does drop a few degrees inside.

Where Cloud Forest truly surpasses other tourist or garden attractions is in its lowest levels. Like a reverse Dante's trip from heaven to hell, after winding your way down the green paradise of Cloud Forest, the only way to exit is through an exhibition on human impact on the environment. While not explicitly graphic, the exhibition and accompanying film paint a bleak picture of human destruction of the environment and the devastating effects of global warming.

You do learn that Cloud Forest is a completely self-sustained environment, but little else that is man-made is so environmentally friendly. This is the rare attraction which asks its visitors to truly look at their impact on the world around them and question what they can do to make life better.

Cloud Forest doesn't leave you in a state of doom for long, though, as the way out then leads back to greenery and miniature orchids and eventually the gift shop.

Be sure to get your hand stamped so you can come back later that same day. I'd recommend going earlier in the day to see Cloud Forest in daylight, then coming back at night during one of the mistings, when the plants are being watered. Colored lights come on at night and clouds of mist are released to help water the greenery. The entire complex is filled with haze, turning Cloud Forest into a surreal world of mist and light.",11-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 12:45:56.693729

The CF is located over many levels and is packed with plants and flowers, all shrouded in a mist they create. There is a huge walkway overhanging the waterfall which is incredible and a little balcony you can climb onto that makes you feel you're in the waterfall.

The sheer scale and technical accomplishment is quite overwhelming.

- As is the beauty of this man made ecosystem - based on a naturally occurring cloud forest.

There are also contemporary artworks by prominent artists subtly intermingled within the planters.

Take a jacket - it's humid and cool inside.

I would recommend at least 2 hours for this dome and another hour for the botanic garden which is next door.

Price for both tickets is approximately 40$ Singapore. Totally worth it. If you are a frequent visitor, the annual pass for unlimited access is only about double they amount.

Don't miss this!

Provided you have good weather, take a few hours to walk around Gardens at the bay too. Again, very impressive - look out for the man made tree canopy. The garden area is free.

The Cloud Forest was a really cool experience. I bought my tickets ahead of time on Voyagin (for both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) so that I paid $23.00 SGD as opposed to the $28.00 SGD tickets cost on the Gardens website (as a non-Singaporean). I easily downloaded my ticket and was able to scan the ticket directly off my phone, so very easy to get in and out.
I arrived at the Cloud forest around 9:30 am which was a perfect time on a Friday morning. The forest was essentially empty and I enjoyed a lot of the views on my own, uncluttered by selfie taking swarms.
In retrospect, I was a little disappointed I didn't think of getting an audio tour. They are available at the ticketing booth which I skipped when I bought my ticket online. If you are interested in that, don't forget to pick one up before you set foot in the Forest.

It was not crowded and I felt like I had plenty of room and time to take pictures and look at everything I wanted to.

I wish there had been a little more signage explaining the different plants and flower I was looking at, but the signs that were there explaining the ecosystem were interesting.

You walk in below ground level and then take an elevator to the top. Then you walk down a series of ramps and stairs to get a 360 view of the ""mountain"" inside the dome. On one side, a couple of the ramps jut out away from the “mountain”. Since I am sometimes skittish about heights, I thought I might have a problem here, but it wasn’t bad at all. There were some terrific views of the marina, the city, and the oncoming thunderstorm. I was also impressed by all of the tree root sculptures placed all around.

As others have recommended you should absolutely try to organize your visit to sync with one of the ""misting"" times. It really does add to the experience. At the time of this review, they were misting at 10.00am, 12.00pm, 2.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm. The current misting times are posted on the gardens by the bay website.

The information placed around the dome is very good and is provided in all four of Singapores languages. They also have audio guides for many more languages, making this a very accessible and multinational experience.

The vast collection of plants is astonishing and great care has been taken to habituate them in the dome and show them off to visitors. However, this for me was what was disappointing.

By 'cloud forest', I expected to walk into a contained environment where a habitat would be created by allowing plants and flowers to grow freely and with little to no human intervention, to mimic that of a natural cloud forest habitat. In this case, it is little more than a pretty garden with some good skywalks.

For this, I felt S$28 was expensive. But the staff were very pleasant.

Welcome to part two of my visit to ‘Gardens By The Bay’.

Upon exiting The Flower Dome, the entrance to Cloud Forest is but a short distance away. Staff manning the turnstiles will request the remainder of your ticket.

Once inside, the atmosphere suddenly turns cool and idyllic, as once sees a gigantic man made waterfall tumbling down to one’s right, which is truly a feast for the eyes.

Photos taken, one makes their way up a slight ramp within Cloud Forest. Escalators and elevators are available should one wish to take advantage of them, to reach the ‘summit’. On the way down, there are a series of walkways that encircle the magnificence of this breathtaking attraction, which is housed within a massive greenhouse.

Descending escalators within the 'forest' allow one to enjoy further interesting attractions, with exits onto the descending exterior walkway. A photographic must is 'capturing' the outside world through foliage encircled openings from within the forest.

The basic gist of the place is that it simulates the conditions at an altitude very few of us will otherwise visit, and the humidity and the feel are admittedly something else. (Get ready to get gently soaked.)

The misty mountain is impressive, even if it is just a skeleton of steel and concrete covered in plantlife. At night, it looks like a giant otherworldly mothership hovering over you.

The plants are a bit, well, samey though. There isn't a great deal of variety to be had, and unless you have a keen botanical eye, you won't be able to tell one leafy thing from the next.

That said though, you aren't likely to see a building this crazy anywhere else, so it is worth it to go in and just enjoy the Cloud Forest dome as a unique architectural showpiece. Soak in the moisture and the feel of the place.",07-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 12:49:44.394565

Just like the Flower Dome, the building housing the Cloud Forest is an engineering marvel that will impress travelers of all ages and backgrounds. Additionally, the air-conditioning was very welcomed on a hot, humid day of touring the Gardens by the Bay. The waterfalls in the Cloud Forest are a sight to behold, and the variety of plants is stunning. The exhibits are very well put together and also educational. On my visit there, most visitors were through the entire exhibit in less than forty-five minutes, while I spent around three hours enjoying this truly incredible creation.

Bring your camera because there is plenty of photo opportunities within; however, because of the number of people on the walkways, I would recommend one leave their “selfie” sticks outside and be considerate of others.

One is directed to the other side of the dome where you ride the elevator to the 6th floor. From there you make you way slowly along a walkway as you descend through the cloud foresr, encountering new plant species and a different flora as you go. I timed my visit to coincide with the bi-hourly misting of the whole environment. This gives you the realistic feeling of being in a cloud.

I must admit I did not pay too much attention to the additional exhibits and only quickly reviewed the video show back at ground level plotting the disaster scenario of eventual global warming.

,1,5,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/John S,549109469,25-12-2017,1,Horrible waste of time,"I was quite excited to see the Gardens by the Bay. And while the Flower Dome was ok, the Supertree Grove and Cloud Forest were terribly disappointing.

Firstly, the Cloud Forest seems to be misleadingly sold as the Supertree access. As there are signs for Supertree Grove everywhere but there are no actual tickets for this, it is possible to mistake the Cloud Forest for the main attraction. Especially when the park’s ticketing agent tells you so when asked directly.

Secondly, this is essentially a giant, hour plus long queue walking around a man made water fountain. While the structure has some plants and flowers on the outside you never get close enough to see them properly. And the inside of the fountain is just concrete so you feel like you are winding your way down a multi-story car park that is suffering from a burst water pipe.

As with many experiences, who you are in the queue with makes a difference. While the Flower Dome was also busy, because it was more open plan, everyone can move as needed. But the combination of a lack of interesting things to see and the prescriptive queueing means that lots of aggressive pushing ensues theoughout including on ramps, stairs, and just waiting to catch a lift. I am aware that pushing aggressively is culturally accepted in some countries. But when everyone is walking at the same speed and you suddenly get elbowed out by grannies who want to take a photo where you happen to be standing, it is a surprise. After about five incidents by different people from different parties, it starts getting boring.

You enter and see a 7 story waterfall with sprays from several points. It is of course man made, but the design is very cool. Lots of people taking loads of photos there, as it is quite captivating as an entrance and inviting and exciting to see what is beyond the entrance. After you take lots of photos there from every angle, you walk around the side and ride an elevator up to the 6th level. There, you take one short flight of stairs and you begin your walk down. The walkways are solid so that even those with fears of heights will be and feel secure.

You start at the cloud garden and walk down, tons of live plants displayed everywhere, including orchids and others with great flowers and interesting leaf formations. As you walk down, you can peek out and you are at various viewpoints behind the waterfall which makes for even more great photo ops. One level down is a garden with live plants and legos made to look like plants that was very well done, another level down is the crystal forest where there are huge (5 feet tall) crystals displayed quite well. A whole room of these, then you take an escalator down and end up in an area that is called the ""Secret Garden"". which has a pond and related plants as well as a much smaller waterfall and feature.

The Cloud Forest was very fun to explore, is stopped often to take in the views through the glass of the area as well as the magnificence of the place itself. Well done in every respect and not cheesy at all as had been my experience next door at Flower Dome. I took a ton of photos and thoroughly enjoyed my visit there. I went during the day time and wish I would have gone at night when it was lit up to see the difference in display too. I spent nearly 2 hours touring this place.

The walk around was very refreshing and it's cooler and more comfortable inside, even with a large crowd. As you walk around the walkways and in and out of the inside areas there are wood sculptures that are exquisite and you wonder how they were made - out of driftwood, but with animals and people coming out of them, or benches carved into animal heads at the end.

Whether you're a horticulturist or someone who just likes to stop and sniff the flowers, this exhibit is worth visiting and revisiting -- there's so much to take in, even to inhale. You enter to a stunning view of the waterfall. There's a scenic walk up a path that leads you to elevators -- the only way up to the top of the Cloud Garden. Exit to a path down that holds marvels at every turn. There's also a secret garden at the very bottom level. You can take as much or as little time as you wish to explore. It's chilly at the bottom level - a stark contrast from the heat of the Singapore day. We didn't make it in time to see the misting, which I can only imagine to be a fun and refreshing experience. I recommend you go when it's likely to be less busy; we were there at 6:30 PM and it was just the right amount of crowds that didn't take away from the experience. If you time it right, you can see the Cloud Garden and make it out in time for the evening Supertree show at 7:45 PM (timing of this may vary by season so make sure to check the times for yourself when you're there).",02-2019,Friends,2020-01-29 12:56:15.089810

As you enter into Cloud Forest, you will be greeted by a man made 35 meters tall waterfall, as you walk along be fascinated by the plants at the planted walks. Look out for the “Pitcher Plants”, it’s a cup-shaped leaves and it look harmless, but it actually kills and digests insects and small animals that venture within.
Cloud Forest is next to Flower Dome

The gardens are free however there is an entry fee to the forest and/or flower dome. We only went to the forest. It is luscious greenery as you walk slowly up towards the lifts. Be careful that at some stage a queue begins to form for the lift to take you up to the overhead walk. The queue was not obvious as there are many people taking photos. Perhaps some barriers would help earlier on once you enter. You can jump the queue for the lifts by walking up the 4 flights of stairs.
Once you are on the walkway you have beautiful views of the tropical forest with plenty of photo opportunities as you wind your way back down through the crystal gallery and a video presentation.

You'll be tempted to backtrack & experience the walkway a 2nd (3rd?) time... but no need to go against the one way traffic; just take the lift back up!

If you are a visitor to Singapore, this is definitely a must-visit tourist attraction (even for local citizens like me).

Compared to the Flower Dome, which has several different exhibitions being rotated throughout the year, the Cloud Forest is always consistent.

A slow and thorough visit to see and experience everything inside this dome will take about three hours (if you pace slowly and read all the descriptions and signs all around the place, including viewing the informative video show about ""global warming"".)

At the entrance, you will be greeted by the massive artificial ""waterfall"", which makes a great spot for photo taking. You will slowly descent the mild-slope upwards till you reach the lifts to go to the top floors.

Wheelchair-bound visitors may also use designated lifts that bring them to the top of the dome, and you can descend from there.

There can be certain spots where the floor may be slippery due to wetting by the water/droplets from the ""waterfall"". Elderly visitors should take care when wearing ""frictionless"" footwear like flip-flops or high-heels.
Sport shoes and working shoes/leather shoes are fine/work best.

There are toilets within the cloud forest, so visitors need not worry.
For visitors who wish to hydrate (drink) with plain water, there are some water-coolers located just outside the toilets.

TIP: For visitors who can spend more time there (eg: whole day), my tip for you is to go for the ""RE-ENTRY"" stamping at the exit gantries, where the staff will stamp you with a ultraviolet colour stamp which, you can come back into the dome in the evening time or at night.

NOTE: Last entry into the cloud forest is at 8.30pm, and all visitors must leave by about 9pm!

Visitors be reminded to consider wearing very comfortable shoes, as the walking distance from the nearest hotel (Marina Bay Sands) is about 600 metres at least.

The Cloud Forest is a temperature controlled glass dome which includes an indoor waterfall which must be over 100 ft high, canopy walkways and a staggering display of jungle plants and flowers. Design wise the whole building is truly staggering.

Me and my friends were expecting a hot and humid environment like you would see at a botanical garden at home ; Canada. And we were wondering why they would build such a thing when everyday it's hot and humid outdoors ....a bit of reading would have helped our understanding. In any case, great attraction especially if you come from a hot and humid climate. Huge variety of plants from across the world in beautiful arrangements. If you come from a cold climate , still very nice as the entire design is amazing, and a good break from the heat. To that point , visitors may want to bring a very light jacket

The price is a bit steep, even more so if you are a non resident. But with the amount of cooling and water required it's somewhat understandable.

I would recommend both sections of the attraction, if you have time and are willing to spend the money",05-2017,Friends,2020-01-29 13:02:17.185049

The flora is interesting and there are pipes that make up the waterfalls but I fail to be really impressed by them. Looks totally artificial and unnatural. There is a collection of stalactites or stalagmites depending on which way they were prior to harvesting. There are interesting plants to be seen, but a small fraction of the plant house in the adjacent pavilion.

Worth a look around and if possible buy the combined ticket to access all features of Gardens by the Bay. On a positive note - the air conditioning is sublime - great for a retreat.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 13:04:31.555134

The cloud forest is a beautiful place. You should come during the misting time at 10.00am, 12.00pm, 2.00pm, 4.00pm, 6.00pm, 8.00pm daily. You have to walk around the cloud forest and ride the elevator to the top. We will go down after circling around each floor. There are different themes on each floor and its very good for taking photos. In fact, I saw a couple doing their pre-wedding photos there~
If you're not keen of walking a lot, I would not recommend this place. There is elevator available but in my opinion you cannot fully enjoy the beauty of this place if you don't walk around.",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 13:04:31.797016

The Cloud Forest conservatory at Gardens by the Bay feels like a real-life versio of Balamb Garden sans the classroom and training grounds. The moment you enter its doors, you will feel like you have stepped into a fantasy world that satisfies all your wildest videogamer imagination.

The first thing that welcomes you is this majestic misty falls, which immediately creates a feeling of grandeur. Then, you will almost as instantly feel that the place is chilled to a colder-than-usual temperature. At times, particularly in the evening, those who are less than tolerant of the cold may need a sweater, but most other times, it's a refreshing coldness from the humidity of the outdoors.

I have always gone up to the Lost World first; and, then made my way down to all the other displays/exhibits. I just feel that that route is the most effective way to appreciate the garden and to fully enjoy a kind of Final Fantasy exploration experience in it.

There are so many beautiful orchids, which they manage to grow together in one place; and, at night, when all the lights are turned on, the top-most part of the garden even further appeals to my Final Fantasy perception of it, because it looks like the nose of the Ragnarok Spaceship making its way into the garden. It is also almost always misty inside, thus adding to the intriguing mystery that the place gives off.

Of course, you have to have some inherent appreciation for nature, to truly enjoy being here. Coupled with a healthy imagination; and, this place can be such a heaven in all its Final Fantasy-like glory!

It is perfectly tranquil for the soul-searching solo traveler; romantic for couples on a date; soothing for the stressed out busy-body; intriguing for the first-time tourist; and, exciting for kids with adventurous mindsets. It is educational too, as it offers lessons on global warming; and, conservation in one of the mid-level floors.",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 13:05:04.084615

They have beautifully managed it to the core I must say that.

The stone artifacts are also eye catchy and wonderful for historic people to look upon.

Your visit will start off with a bang because you'll go from hot Singapore, through some double doors and will be at the bottom of about a five-story-high waterfall. The mist and breeze will instantly cool you off. I'd venture to say that if you stayed there a while, you'd get downright cold. From the bottom you then take long, spiraling walkways to the top. It's extremely well done with something to see at every point. It's also designed so the top has plants and flowers found at much higher elevations.
I would try if possible to visit on somewhat off-peak times because the fewer the people, the more you'll feel like you are in a cool rainforest.
The only aspect I could do without is the brainwashing about man-made climate change in a theater at the base of the facility, despite lots of evidence that NASA and the UN have tampered with temperature data to arrive at their desired outcome.

It is a vegetative habitat that is fun to explore. You are greeted at the entrance by several waterfalls pouring from far up the indoor mountain. An elevator takes you near to the top of the massive cone and you climb a stairway to the highest point. From there there is a walkway down to the lowest level that weaves in and out of the mountain, lush with vegetation and presenting spectacular views of the surrounding areas. The architecture of the dome itself is worth the visit. It's chilly inside the dome, especially after walking through the outdoor Gardens in the Singapore heat. If you get cold easily, bring a light jacket or sweater. The base has presentations on global warming and the environment that may (or may not) be of interest. The exit funnels you through a massive gift shop which somewhat dulls the experience.

The plants themselves are viewed from a suspended walkway which start on the 7th level (accessed by an elevator) and slowly spirals down and around the mountain.

I would recommend this over the Flower Garden since I find the Flower Garden to be a little bit boring compared to this.

It takes the visitor through each of the levels within a forest from the treetops to the base experiencing what it would be like in a real environment.
It's also cool which is a good respite from the Singapore weather.
One point i would make is that best to avoid the peak times so you can take your time exploring. My experience is that the morning is best.
