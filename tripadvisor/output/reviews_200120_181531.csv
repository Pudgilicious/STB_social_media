Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance.

It's only a short ride from the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal (where you can leave you luggage). The super trees were super. Early in the day there are fewer people so we really enjoyed the Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's surprising how huge the domes really are and they have unique displays.

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-20 18:15:47.751750

Floral fantasy a little further way from the centre but well worth the hike or shuttle. A small area with floral decorations and interpretations followed by the finale of a 4d film following the path of a dragonfly.....non moving seats on request for those of us with motion sickness

Walking around the clevelry desigined trditonal gardens before going to the tree area was a quiet way to spend some time.

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The best part for kids is the children‚Äôs gardens where they can play with water in small fountains. Kids will enjoy to their fullest here.",09-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 18:16:39.198972

A lot of people but the taxis & the buses were well organised in shambolic traffic so arriving and leaving was fine, take a cab if you can or go with an organised tour.
To me the highlights were the visit to the two domes, you had to pay an entrance fee but they were excellent.",01-2020,,2020-01-20 18:16:39.512942

You can visit them just to make a walk and enjoy the fantastic show with the trees ( at 19:45 & 20:45 every day) which is free of charge. Instead, along with the walk you can visit a variety of sightseeing such as the CLoud Forest , the Flower Dome and the OCBC Skywalk.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-20 18:16:39.866743

We purchased the garden tour package which included admissions to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, and a 20 minute audio tour on a tram going by the art sculptures, Supertree grove, and outdoor gardens.
The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, ‚Äúit replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world‚Äù. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.
The Cloud Forest displayed the ‚Äúcool moist climate of the tropical highlands of Southeast Asia, tropical America and Africa. The 35 foot cascading waterfall with plants on the wall was breathtaking.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-20 18:16:40.307174

The Gardens By The Bay are probably the best gardens that we have visited in the world and are free to walk around. The Sky walk was excellent value for money. At night the light displays are out of this world. A short walk back to the marina on new years eve and we were treated to a fantastic firework display that seemed to go on forever (from 21:30hrs to 00:20hrs and all free to view.,12-2019,,2020-01-20 18:16:44.458774

It can get crowded so perhaps check beforehand about the best times to go.

Its not really a swimming place but a place to take some amazing photos from 100 different angles.

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-20 18:17:05.081669

It was a license to print money. Of course, you're in Singapore, you have to go. But the Singapore skyline is not very impressive. It sure isn't New York, London, Tokyo, Bangkok or many others. It's a pretty small skyline. And as for the lightshow. That's incredibly weak. Not a patch on the one at the Bellagio, Las Vegas, or the one by The Address in Dubai.
