I say daytime because others who have visited the place say the nighttime light shows are even better. The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex. The flower dome is billed as the largest greenhouse in the world - large it is indeed, and nicely cool as well, and the geographically themed parts of the dome very nice.

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, “it replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world”. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.

We went though the domes as fast as we could. The gardens are still amazing, everything is very beautiful.
I recommend not getting tickets with klook in advance because they are for the day you chose and if the weather doesn't allow you to do something, you cannot do the activity some other time or get a refund... The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...
We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.
Another recommendation go there in the afternoon so you can catch the lights, we went around 2pm and finished before sunset, but maybe it was because of the hot weather.",12-2019,,2020-01-17 17:12:59.064115

For me, this visit was enlighting and giving a new perspective that science and technology can make our great nature even more WOW (a.k.a jaw dropping, LOL).
This area is quite huge and perhaps need ""strategy"" so you can use your time wisely and get everything=)
If the weather is good, I suggest you to go around the park first and explore the outdoor area..because the two domes (include the pathways) are totally indoor so no worries with the rain.
All the outdoor area is free to explore..no charge..But for two domes they charge entrance ticket and another charge for observation deck+OCBC skyways.
If you are too tired to walk, the outdoor area can be explored by shuttle car that costs SGD8/1 round trip, but me myself prefered to explore the park on foot. You'll have more time to oberserve and find a lot of photo-shoot spots while walking around. But if you go by shuttle, they provide a recording tape that will give you explanation about the garden. In here, you can see heritage gardens, sun pavilion (cactus) and supertrees while walking around.
After going around the outdoor areas, perhaps you can enter the observation deck and OCBC skyways, because they will close earlier than the domes. But in this visit, I didn't buy the ticket for observation deck & OCBC skyways, so I can't tell you a lot about this..may be next time I'll visit =)
After finished observing the outdoor area, I had lunch first before entering the domes. I would recommend to eat beef & prawn satay at Satay by The Bay. It tastes good, good portion, extra juicy meat and not so expensive. SGD7 for 10 beef satay & SGD2/each prawn satay. The prawn is quite big and juicy. My kids love the prawn very much.. If you don't want to be too full, you can eat with rice cake/""lontong"" (in Malay/Indonesian language) that costs SGD1/small square piece. But if you think you need more carb, maybe better if you just buy rice on other stall and you'll get more by paying the same amount. You can also try water chestnut for the drink, and refreshing tropical fruit for your dessert.
After finished my refreshing lunch, I went to the domes. There are 2 domes, the Flower Domes and the Cloud Forest Dome. I entered the Cloud Forest Dome first...From the first time the entrance door was opened, a huge tall indoor waterfall welcomed me..and it's really a jaw-dropping moment=) I think that is one of the wow-factor of this spot. Perhaps you need to bring jacket, because it's a bit cold inside (even the tap water is cold) and a bit splashy if you take photo near the fall. I was mesmerized by the building structure, how they pump gallons of water all the time to make the man-made waterfall looks alive! and how they use sun panel on the supertree top to make everything works. How smart is the creator of this place!!
This dome is bigger than the Flower Dome..you need to walk on several floors to explore all, but don't worry they have lift too and it is totally accessible for wheel chair and baby stroller. They have waterfall observation deck, the lost world zone (full of mist and you can see carnivore plants), stalagmits collection, orchids, and several unique displays & sculptures from many countries. They even have a lego flowery pond =)
After finished with the Cloud Forest Dome, we went into Flower Dome. There are so many collection of trees and flowers that are arranged to certain theme. The theme will change due to certain period. If the weather is good, you can see the sunset from here too..
The collection of the plants are so many and various and they do alive!! Imagine that many kinds of plants that usually live in different types of habitat can live in one same place.. They put complete explanation on a board in front of every plants. There are several sculpture from stem and roots and they were amazing artwork.
In my visit on January, they were in changing process from Christmas theme to Dahlia (Chinese New Year) theme..The Dahlia will be fully displayed on Jan 17 (if I'm not mistaken). But the existing flower arrangement is still even great for me=) We took several photos in front of the themed garden before leaving this dome.
Then here comes the dinner time.. I chose to eat at Pollen. I recommend you to eat here because it's very near to Supertree..so in case you bring children like me..you know, they eat so slow =) so, if they can't finished their meal before the Supertree Light Show, you can watch while you eat =) There are several restaurants that you can pick here, such as Vietnamese Pho, Japanese, Singaporean chicken/pork rice, Texas fried chicken..at that time I tried the Japanese food and it's so yummy...SGD10-12 for one menu. The portion is quite big, I can not finished myself =) If you want complete menu just add few dollars and you'll have miso soup, 2 slices of watermelon and salad. Bring your tumbler and tap water is free all over the park if you want to save money =)
Then here it is..the closing for this day..the light show...it started on 7.45 p.m and last for around 15min. It great to see the light on supertrees flipping following the music and it's a good photo-shoot spot too with the lighted supertrees behind you..=) you can see the lighted singapore flyer and marina bay sands too from here. In case you missed the show, you can wait for the next show on 8.45 p.m.

Everyone was oohing & aahing as they walked around

Cloud Forest Dome: the minute you walk in and see the waterfall in all its glory.
There are different levels in this dome with different experiences and views of the dome's floral and fauna species
There are great garden sculptures and phenomenal driftwood carved sculptures.
This dome is worth experiencing!

The Super Grove Light Show:
Get there early and claim a place to sit
Many people lay on the concrete beneath the tree structures waiting for the light show
The light show is approx 15 mins long. The lights and lasers are in sync with the music
It was an awesome show and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.....Don't miss it!

After the light show there are huge crowds all walking back towards the city.
Get to the Trolley Cart bus quickly and queue for the bus (if you purchased a ticket) Its a quick couple of minute ride instead of walking back in the crowds.",11-2019,,2020-01-17 17:13:33.759162

While there were a lot of people there, we never felt too overwhelmed by a crowd. We loved the Cloud Forest and walking at the top of the Supertrees. The weather was perfect during our visit, so the heat wasn't an issue, though having a layer in the Cloud Forest is a good idea. We also enjoyed lunch in the food court. Like all of Singapore, it's fairly expensive, but we got a discount with our boarding passes from Singapore Air (and there are other ways to get a little bit off the price).

Christmas Wonderland it wasn’t.,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.

We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn’t an option for us.

It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn’t have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.

At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??

We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn’t an option.

Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly’s promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.

After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.

Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.

All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-17 17:13:49.675657

This man-made master piece lives up to the the hype and offers a beautiful experience worth the lifetime.

The Musical Light Show is spectacular and if you fail to get a ticket (limited tickets makes it impossible to accommodate everyone so please book it way in advance) to observe it from the viewing deck

The light show takes place twice every night and is on for 15 minutes. The first show is on at 7:45pm and the second is on at 8:45pm. An extra show on Holidays is added, for which you'll have check on their official website (usually a 9.45pm show) .

There are many spots to see this beauty but our favorite (and Highly recommended) was to lie down on the concrete circles supporting the Garden Towers called Super tree Groves an hour prior to the show as they fill-in fast.

Others being:

From above, on the skywalk of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, decent view minus the music

On the promenade by the Dragonfly Lake, at the park entrance between Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

The Deck / Skywalk exactly above the public loo overlooking the Super tree Groves (have some steps to climb up)

Other than that there are observatories like Cloud Forest, Flower Forest Dome which are worth the dime.

Numerous sculptures and and arts installed in beautiful corners are worth enjoying.

Restaurants are plenty but standards aren't that great so would suggest to stick to McDs in the Garden.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 17:14:02.847003

I'd definitely say it's worth it and you should go. This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.
The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.
I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out.

Very easy to access by metro and you can find a lot of signs whos here so you cannot get lost. I was really impressed and wasnt expect that good. If you want to go up in the trees you must pay another 7 Dollar inside the garden. This is seprate from the enrance fee. Food is kinda cheap but beers are expensive.

PROS:
- Loved the waterfall and carnivorous plants
- Skywalk experience was nice and gave a better feel of the olace
- Good place to spend time wiyh family, specially the light show in evening
- Food is awesome in the food court on the other side of bridge (unable to recall the name but you will find sign boards for guidance)

CONS:
- Christmas carnival was not at all attractive and needs separate ticket.
- Light show must have been special till few years back but now its a common thing around the world, have seen similar stuff in Akshardham in New Delhi India
- The whole experience seemed to be a bit stretched over the day, specially covering everything during day and then waiting for lights to comeon at night
- OCBC Skywalk is mostly non operational in December due to climate issues. They are very cautious and dont allow operations even if there is only a chance of a rain.

Unfortunately, the Supertree Grove was not accessible due to the a ticket Christmas fair so we could only watch from the outside. The lightshow as ok, nothing to shout about but perhaps we missed the full experience not being closer and not being able to hear the music.

We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.

Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".

So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change. The MRT counter initially didn't want to assist in breaking up our $10 note, which would have left us stranded.

If you want a crash course in why, get yourselves on down to Gardens by The Bay.
My partner and I are no stranger to botanical gardens, which is the most boujey thing I have ever written I am so sorry, but all I’m saying is that it takes a lot to impress us when it comes to flowers. We bought an all-inclusive ticket and, needless to say, were not disappointed.
We visited both the flower room and the cloud forest and were amazed at the level of care, information and sheer wonder on display there. We also went on the 4d motion ride, which was surprisingly a great little diversion.
Now, with it being one of the main sites to see in Singapore, the Gardens always seem to be busy with a capital ‘B’. Be prepared for crowds, but also be prepared for what can only be described as floral fireworks. You owe it to yourselves to see the nightly light shows, everyone.

It’s it spectacular !!!
The sheer scale and size and wonderment of it is beautiful. We come from Ireland, and though my kids are well travelled they were STILL blown away by it!!!
So was I ! It’s hard not too.
It has the two domes, flower dome and cloud dome. For us we preferred the cloud dome as it had mist, height, water, flowers etc.....in an unreal structure!!! The flower dome still impresssive, but just more like really nice gardens, so I’d visit that one first. . There is more to the Cloud dome.
But the star of the show are The Super trees ... they are FAB -U-LOUS!
We did the sky walk also which is worth doing as you walk up around top of trees on a platform.
The light show is a moment I will cherish forever. We lay on the ground with our kids and looked up and this light show....it was one of those moments where I was telling myself to remember this and I said it also to my daughters. It’s not something you see everyday that’s for sure!

If you’re getting the impression that it’s solely about Alice, the Hare, and the other characters, then I must say...Nay!
Alice and the crew are just one of several themes. Singapore has done an amazing creative job of bringing a variety of examples of floral ecosystems from around the world all housed under an architectural master piece.

The Flower Gardens is huge! One could spend hours exploring and losing yourself in the organic fantasy sculptures. During the Christmas/New Year holiday season there’s an entire display dedicated to a secular celebration bathed in lights that will leave no doubts about the beauty and magic of the time of year.

Singapore has a reputation for being hot and humid but that’s not the case in the climate controlled air conditioning inside the Gardens building, a plus for those of us who are impacted by heat related medical issues.

There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro.

There were throngs of people trying to leave at around 8 with lots more trying to get in via one staircase from the Gardens to the bridge leading to marina Bay Sands through one set of escalators down to the shopping complex. Just imagine the chaos if there was an incident that triggered a stampede.

The show itself was nice but a bit repetitive. We werent told the ODBC skyway was closed at 4 so we would have to come back another day to that. The Flower dome was a bit ordinary but the Cloud Forest was great with fantastic architecture. The Skyway itself was short but we were fortunate to visit during a solar eclipse so spent time up there watching the eclipse. It's certainly unique enough to visit once and tick that off your list.

You can either take the MRT (Downtown Line or Circle Line) and alight at the Bayfront station. Then you walk along the connecting walkway linking to the Garden By the Bay (there’s a lift). Then buy tickets to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest if you want and take a stroll to the venue. With a stroller, I recommend the Flower Dome but not the Cloud Forest as the queue for lifts can be long. Then you can stroll to Satay by the Bay to have some satay. It can be really crowded on weekends and public holidays. Then walk to Supertree Grove to watch the night lighting show (please check the time). The show lasts for 15 minutes. If you watch the last show at 8:30pm, please take note that it is very challenging to catch a cab when the show ends. For express taxi in order to avoid queue, you will be charged $30 to Marina Bay Sands, and other destinations $50 which is ridiculous.

Cloud Forest & Flower Dome:
If you buy tickets for this combo, you’ll able to enjoy it for the whole day. You could also do re entry for both venues. Just make sure to get the re entry stamp at the exit. You’ll spend 45mins to 1 hour minimum at each dome. Remember you can come back to visit these domes for the whole day.

Super Grove Trees:
You will need to get the tickets separately from the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome. You’ll spend 45-1 hour here depending on how long you plan your visit. If you’re shooting a pro photo, it may be longer.

Flora Fantasy:
This is a separate exhibition and no re-entry is allowed. There’s a 4D Show before you exit. You will spend approximately 45 mins to 1 hour here.

Team Lab showcase:
This is showing currently till March 2020. You will need to ride on the shuttle to get here. You can purchase at the ticket counter for 3 dollars per person. Get a stamp as you are able to ride the shuttle for the whole day.

Tips:
Go early morning so you can enjoy the venues at slow pace without many people.

Go on weekdays if possible. Weekends are usually very crowded. In general, this place is very popular.

Grab Car or take a cab if you can. No need to struggle to get a parking if you’re driving in the island. This place can be quite competitive to score a parking at peak hour.

If you’ve re entry stamps for Cloud Forest & Flower Dome - you can come back in the evening. You will be able to enjoy TeamLab eggs lights and also the music show at Super Grove Trees.

It has two paid parks Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Former is a manmade representation of how forest in Amazon grows, beautiful, falls, mists and walkway created to give you a feel of what it could be.

Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.

Besides there's a OCBC skyway, good for a one time visit but reach before sunset if you want to have nice photos. However the associated laser show towards end of day ( 2 timings) is really interesting.

There's a lot of free area associated with Gardens by the bay which is a very nice 2 hours walk to the Gardens and a good day visit to locals. If you are visiting Singapore for a short time, it can be completely skipped.",01-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-17 17:15:33.640035

At the gardens; barely any lines if you’re there at 10am.
We bought the pass combined for these attractions with included shuttle (which is so worth it on a hot day). Floral fantasy had the nicest flowers but cloud Forrest was just amazing especially with the mist going. Flower dome was also nice but my least favourite.

Bought separate ticket to the new Supertree observation deck on the first day it was open. don’t forget to go to the rooftop! Best views in Singapore because you can see the sky deck and super trees, Ferris Wheel and harbour. You don’t need to do the other Supertree walking path as the views are similar but not as high.

Good selection for lunch at the food hall including gluten free options at the Vietnamese.
We walked back over through marina bay sands and filled in the rest of the afternoon walking around marina bay. A big walking day but a great way to see the area.

We came back that night to watch the super trees light show. It was amazing. You also don’t need a ticket to enter the park and watch the show. Tip; watch from down amongst the trees themselves!

The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee.

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 17:15:56.492688

There is no real refreshment stalls and one tacky souvenir shop.

There is NO access to the swimming pool, which is actually what the MBS is famous for, it is only for hotel guests, even hotel guests visitors can not access it.

Save your money and go on the Singapore Flyer (wheel) which is nearby. You will get a much better view of the city, albeit another $10 or $15 more.

So do not waste your money at the Skypark.

Incidentally, we live in Singapore and have stayed at the hotel, the pool is not all it is cracked up to be anyway, my wife has also visited the skypark and said it was a waste of money.
We take all visitors on the Flyer, this is the best way to get a view of Singapore and pick out places of interest to visit later.

A simple question at reception revealed you can go up to this classy bar with better views for virtually the same price.
Go to Tower 1 and the Ce La Vie desk on the ground level and purchase a ticket for £11 English pounds. Then go up to level 57 and you use your £11 ticket as credit at the bar for drink or food. For an extra £2 we all enjoyed a fabulous cocktail with a much better atmosphere and incredible views. For the same price there were people just walking around a plain observation deck!!! They seemed completely crazy to us! Additionally, the bar wraps around so you can wander and get various views as well as going right to the edge of the famous infinity pool.

Little did I realize this gets you access to a tiny sliver of the north side of the deck. While the view is nice for a bit, there is little room to explore at all.

Oh, and to add insult to injury... they keep the adjacent restaurant sectioned off for guests only. Because you’re not really a guest and god forbid you try to spend your poor-person money at their fancy restaurant.

The building or 3 towers is just awesome , a real feat of architecture and engineering . The ground floor has two hotel receptions , shops and restaurants & is very busy.

The skypark is at one end and wasn’t that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.

I don’t like heights so was very unnerved by being so high up so had to let my hubby take in the views & take some photos. There is a small cafe selling drinks and a gift shop but there is no where to sit. Clearly they don’t want you to stay up there for for too long. There is a restaurant too but on the day we went it closed at 2 pm

I honestly don’t know how they built this building as it is amazing but don’t expect to see the famous infinity pool as this is only for hotel guests and the skypark is only one end of the top floor so don’t expect to be able to walk around the whole level.

We then decided to have something to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the skypark, but were informed that we could not enter the restaurant from the skydeck and would have to leave the skypark via the lift and return to a different level before entering this restaurant. This seemed a little bit odd considering there was an entrance via a couple of stairs from the skydeck. We were also informed that once we left the skypark we would not be able to return. Apparently the operators of the 'Skypark' and the adjacent restaurant were not prepared to co-operate, hence the ludicrous decision to prevent people on the skydeck entering the restaurant.

Only one negative, there was absolutely no place to sit down, no seats at all, and no shelter from sun or rain ( the restaurant was off-limits to us when we attended) so your stay at the top will be limited by how long your legs hold out.

A quick elevator ride and you come out to an incredible view of the Singapore harbour.
All of the key landmarks of Singapore are laid out before you, the Singapore Flyer, the Art Centre, the Merlion and much more.
If you are a guest of the hotel (unfortunately we weren’t) you can sit in the infinity pool and soak up the view. Otherwise spend some time walking around the observation deck, read the information boards dotted around to find out more about each of the landmarks.
Once you have had your fill of the view, there is plenty more to see with the Cloud Garden and Flower Garden at the base, as well as the rest of the beautiful gardens in the area.

The observation platform is on the 56th floor and is 12,400 metres high and is located on the rooftop of one of the most recognisable and iconic buildings on Singapore's skyline.

The ticket price was 23$SD, however, when purchasing our ticket we received a 15% discount because we were travelling with Singapore Airlines. The actual ticket price was 19.55 $SD, roughly £11 each.

There was no time limit to the length of stay up on the platform, we spend roughly 1 hour up there.

From the observation deck it is possible to see the landmarks and places of interest in Singapore. There were information boards around pointing out the sights. We were able to see, Singapore Flyer, Supertree Grove,The Quays, Science Museum, Merlion and so much more.

While on the platform it was possible to climb the steps to the 57 floor for a brief higher vista. This floor had bar, restaurant and swimming pool, this was for the Sands Hotel guests and those that purchased the package. For us access to the viewing platform was good enough. There was a kiosk there which was charging 4$SD about £2.30 for a can of Coke Cola.

A part from walking around admiring the views there isn't much else to do up there. It is not possible to walk all the way around the observation deck as it did not go all the way around.",10-2019,,2020-01-17 17:18:34.402209

The roughly s$20 fee seems a little high, but we didn't feel as ripped off as we did in the ArtScience museum.

The advance ticket sellers gave the impression you would be limited to a specific entry and exit time, herded as a group, and it would probably sell out.
