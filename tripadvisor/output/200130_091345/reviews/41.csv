The coastal trail was much less interesting, and like most beaches in Singapore, you could see all the plastic trash that washes up on shore from the cargo ships.

We were there during low tide. I plan to explore it again during different tides to see what's different.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:29.602593
,1,41,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/SonyGM,543722914,28-11-2017,5,May be my favourite reserve in Singapore,"I have been to this nature reserve many times before, and it really depends on who you are for whether or not you'd like it.

First of all, I recommend going fairly early in the morning, at about 8-9 o'clock. This is so because if you go later than these times, then there is a higher chance that you'll be engulfed in a swarm of mosquitos. That being said, you MUST bring bug spray even if you go early in the morning, to protect you from the itch and diseases carried by these mosquitos.

Secondly, the campus and cleanliness of the reserve from the bathrooms and huts standpoint quite varies. At the entrance point, I found the bathrooms and entrance deck area to be very appealing and clean. As you move into the giant loop of a path (just past the bridge), there are no bathrooms, and the huts you can find are weathered down a bit, considering that they are in the open air.

Finally, and what I find to be most important, is the wildlife. It is an extremely diverse area, from otters to birds of prey to crocodiles, it truly is a natural beauty. I come to this park nearly every Saturday to take pictures, and every time I go there's something really interesting to find or to look at, such as finding an Osprey.

All in all this park is very likeable, if you enjoy being outdoors and getting potentially getting dirty.",11-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:35.457408

Why? Because they are shouting at their top of their voices and chattering and laughing.

Especially on weekdays, there's barely anyone there and it is peaceful and calm. Combine this with the sound of the water and the birds and you already have a winner.

We took a stroll around the reserve, and able to see there are lots of hides and bird watching locations being setup. I could imagine during migration, the scene should be awesome

A great getaway from the busy working schedule, not a bad place to spend a lazy afternoon.

Could see some monkeys and monitor lizards. Didn't manage to see any crocs (although there are lots of warning signs)

We managed to see a small lizard eats a carb near at the bank.

During Sun and Public Holiday, take 925 from Woodlands will bring you straight to this reserve",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:36.433526
,1,41,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/berver65,507014507,30-07-2017,3,Average,"After sightseeing in the city, we were wishing to discover some nature. We had the choice between :
- MacRitchie reservoir (open from 9 am till 5pm)
- Sungei Buloh
- Labrador nature reserve (park)
- Dairy farm nature park
- Southern ridges walk
- Bukit Timah nature reserve (free)

So, we have chosen Sungei Buloh. You need to take the subway, then a bus. On week ends and school holidays, the bus stops at the reserve but otherwise, it stops a little before. You notice when the bus does a U turn in a car park. After a few yards, you'll see a board indicating that there is a parking. If you want, you can start your visit by this entrance.
My deception was that we didn't see many animals or fish. I think, we should have named this reserve 'dry' reserve instead of 'wetland'. All in all, it wasn't so bad but it took us half a day in total for a walk in the woods.
I wouldn't recommand it. Take a chance in seeing some other 'green' site like Singapore Botanic gardens where you won't loose your time in transport.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:36.755929

Whilst it was not migratory season, there was still plenty of birds, fishes and crabs to see. The tall trees and mangrove shielded most of the sunlight and with a sea breeze, it was still an enjoyable walk. Didn't manage to see any monitor lizards or crocodiles this time round but will be back in the future.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:37.150777
,1,41,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/abc_at_Huntsville,506305804,28-07-2017,4,The perfect urban oasis: abundant wildlife is the main draw,"When we visited in the late morning (on a weekday), there was hardly any people, much to our delight. It was a wonderfully peaceful natural setting, which is hard to come by in busy Singapore. The park admission is free of charge. We went to the park by taking Bus 925, which makes stops at several nearby MRT stations for your convenience. We got off at the ""Kranji Resovoir Pk B"" stop (Monday-Saturday only) to get to the park. You will know this stop because the bus pulls into a parking lot at this point.

Needless to say, the weather is very hot and air-conditioning is limited to the visitor center, so plan accordingly. Much of the paths are shaded, and rest shelters are well-spaced. The paths are all flat and paved, and suitable for all ages.

Do try the Mid-Canopy walk, where you get to walk across a (very fun) swinging bridge over the forest floor. I also visited the ""Mud Experience"" area, where you can climb down and get close to the water level of the swamps (I saw a large mudskipper here).

On that note, the real highlight of the park is the wildlife. Even though it was not the migratory season, we saw a mudskipper, several large lizards, a snake, a colorful spider, and various birds all within close range. The contrast with the skyscrapers across the water in Malaysia adds to the setting. In comparison to any of the forests back home in Alabama, the biodiversity in this park is simply incredible.

Perhaps my issue with the park is that it is too ""built-up"". All the paths are well-paved concrete/gravel roads, and special art and informational signs are all around the park. At times, it seemed more like a ""wildlife attraction"" rather than a wildlife reserve. While the wildlife and nature is definitely there, the design of the park isn't ""wild"" enough to do the place justice.

Overall though, this is an excellent oasis from the busy city that is also easily accessible. It is the perfect complement to any visit to Singapore.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:37.446596

,1,41,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Derek Y,457235372,05-02-2017,4,Pleasant Mangrove Enclave,"One of the last wetland reserves in Singapore. If you enjoy nature, taking a nice pleasant walk at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a must. There is a new entrance to the wetland although the older entrance is still in operation. If you enter the wetland via the old entrance you get to access the long bridge build across the river. Here, your chances of seeing a fresh water estuarine crocodile is must higher. Depending on the time you visit the reserve, you will get to see a bigger concentration of Giant Monitor Lizards, Herons, Kingfishers and even sea otters.
The paths are well maintained and the trek has many hideouts as you
make your way through the reserve. Pay attention to mudskippers as well as a variety of insects along the way. At the entrance, there is also
a gallery showing you all the inhabitants found in the reserve. I highly recommend the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve if you enjoy photography or like to see Singapore in a totally different perspective.
Transportation to Sungei Buloh can cost quite a bit via taxi, therefore
an alternative is to catch the local MRT to Kranji Station and then catch
a short taxi ride which may cost under SGD$15 dollars to the reserve.
Another alternative is to look out for shuttle to and fro Kranji MRT Station which
is called the Countryside Express.",02-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:52:44.368432

Take 925 Bus- this bus will loop at the small bus stand at Kranji Reservoir on Week days and goes to the entraance of Sungei bulog wetland reserve main entrance on weekends and public holidays,

A 10 min walk from Kranji reservervoir to SB wetland reserve will give you a glimpse of Singapore vegetable forms and crocodile farms and bollywood veggie farms.

Once you enter you need to pay 50 cents as fee. There is a Walk way thorough the park to see the tidal areas and observation decks to see birds and other marine fish and mudskippers in that ecosystem.

You will frequenty witness water monitor lizard and they can be mistaken as komodo dragons. No need tobe scared. they dont harm you unless you disturb them mostly they are shy creatures. you can also witness tree climbing crabs which are small in size.

Since this area is a inter tidaal area meaning water floods this area and drains during low tide , Please stay on th walk way and dont nter any areas which are forbidden to public. and Please avoid staying after dark. there are no lights there because it is a kind of Undisturbed forest and risk of Mosquitoes is very much present.

You can take board walk at the entrance it self and can se Malaysia from there.

The route is not circular therefore you are walking back over the same path. Probably good to avoid the midday sun - it was intense on our visit - but we had no choice on this occasion. The upper carpark is more popular and there are more facilities - drinks etc - here. Saw several monitors swimming in the pools here.

First 1 hour was a pleasant walk as it was cooler but it started getting hotter around midday (Seemed to be the hottest weekend in a while). Kids started to get irritated and worst part was we were not able to see any wildlife like we had thought before the trip.

Its a good spot to visit for half a day. Its different from your usual outing in Singapore.

Will i go there again? Yes but will chk the weather first and might go early morning or late afternoon.

It is a beautiful, wonderful, magical place, but it is filthy with pollution. Unfortunately, it’s not the fault of the park maintainers, it is the park patrons.

As you’ll see from my photos, we saw some amazing live creatures.

When you enter the park it is clean and well-maintained. As we crossed the wood and rope bridge, we saw monkeys in the trees. When we looked down, we saw Styrofoam food containers thrown by park patrons.

As we walked through the trees and listen to the beautiful bird calls, or I was caught by colorful soda cans and plastic water bottles.

In the same wetlands where we saw mudskippers and crabs, hanging from the trees were takeaway bags of tea discarded into the air by park patrons.

The sounds were amazing and peaceful, the buzzing of cicadas and the tree-shaded walkways lent to the perfect atmosphere for an afternoon walk.

The full length of trails took us about 45 minutes of slow walking, picture taking, and appreciation of the wildlife. The return walk only took about 20 at a quick pace.

We didn’t see any crocodiles and are wondering if the water pollution has caused them to scare off, or to seek less polluted areas for hunting. I think everyone should take a trip to this park.

If you use Google Maps, there is a Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve Visitor Centre. This area is the ""new section"" of the Wetlands.
To reach the old wetlands, one must travel along Neo Teow Cres off Kranji Way, to reach Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve indicated on Google Maps. Once there, you must head westwards, where you will need to cross a bridge across the Buloh Besar River to reach the beautiful part of the wetlands, where migratory birds usually flock to and rest in these parts, during the year end months, when birds migrate here.
If you head eastwards, you will walk in the new section, where it is harder to see migratory birds.
At low tide, you might see crocodiles in the Buloh Besar river, from the bridge.
Spray anti-mosquito repellent and carry one if necessary, when you forage into the wetlands, and observe birds from the many observation sheds designed for bird-watching.

The birds starting to chirp as if to welcome the group of amateur birdwatchers gathered at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. I had kept faith despite the heavy early morning rain to turn up for the “Birdwatching 101” workshop (for which I was on the waitlist) by National Parks volunteer speaker-guide (Wan Ling) and was aptly rewarded with an “on-the-spot” sign-up.

After an introductory session of the wetland at the education center, tips on selecting and setting the binoculars, and the basics of birdwatching, we were in for a treat. It was 08 September and the season for the southbound migratory birds has just began. Singapore is one of several stop-over for these birds.

At the main bridge, 2 monitor lizards was seen perched on a protruding branch (were they taking shelter from the earlier rain), a sight that surprised several of us. There were a pair of painted stork flying overhead, and at a later time, another stork perched itself on a branch with a resting monitor lizard a meter away (no fighting broke out).

At the main hide, it was a wonderful sight to behold – birds feeding off the wetland, roaming or resting, occasional “synchronised” flights in small flocks. As a newbie to birdwatching, it is hard to differentiate which were the migratory birds and “resident” birds, but it was simply a blessing to be able to sight so many of them:- the common red shank, collared kingfisher, herons, painted storks, and so on.

The workshop participants were introduced to several other interesting facts, including the water regime management to enrich the wetland and the cooperation with other international wetlands etc… Then, there was a small distraction of a mudskipper keeping busy digging its ponded home, and how it defended its territory from one of its own kind surveying close by.

It was a rewarding outing and I came back a week later but this time, I was there early when the tide was low. At the main bridge, National Parks volunteer (Bernard) was “Crocodile Dundee” for the morning, chatting up visitors on Estaurine Crocodiles and with his camera set-up and zoomed-in, helped us view a resting crocodile in the downstream shore and the famed “Tail-less” (it did not have a tail) of Sungei Buloh in the upper stream.

Seeing it on photograph and now with my own eyes, “Tail-less” was an amazing sight in its own right. “He” has a storied presence as an iconic Sungei Buloh attraction, including how it made a meal out of a fallen squirrel (viewed on volunteer’s smartphone) and more famously (an uploaded video in the past week) of how a family of otters fought off the attention of “Tail-less” with their popping heads and banded aggression.

The anticipation of an otter-crocodile encounter did not materialize that morning, although the otters were sighted near Platform 1 by others. This time, I have the chance to complete the migratory bird trail and mounted the Aerie Tower. While the birds were fewer compared to a week ago, they were nonetheless a sight to behold. Monitor lizards seemed to be thriving in the wetland with sightings in different parts of the wetland.

Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is 25 years old, the first to be gazetted in Singapore (2002). It is an important stop-over point for migratory birds and was recognised by the inclusion of the reserve into the East Asian Australasian Shorebird Site Network.

I've read about Sungei Buloh Wetland reserve and asked around how to get there. I was advised it's pretty complicated to get there but it's worth it. It was actually quite easy but it took about an hour to get there from the city center. I used the subway til Kranji station and from there I took a taxi because I didn't want to loose much time waiting for the bus. Coming back I used the bus+subway -so there are public transportation options. Once you get there you can follow several trails with plenty of birdlife: storks, herons&egrets, waders, orioles and a few passerines. I got there at low tide and got to see a huge estuarine crocodile, plenty of mudskippers and lizards but missed the horseshoe crabs. The cicadas were unbelievably loud but very enjoyable!
The trails have info panels along them and are nicely marked and even if you are not a passionate birdwatcher you can still enjoy a nice walk in the nature.

The MRT didn't open until just after 6.30 and so that means if you are relying on that, that the earliest you can get there is about 8am. I took a taxi from Kranji MRT station so that I wouldn't be any later and was dropped off at the Visitor Centre (less than $6) - a fabulous place to start. There's a lovely walk along the coast and through forest. There were hardly any people and I had close encounters with monkeys and kingfishers which was just lovely. I was a little spooked by all the ""watch out for crocodile"" signs. Being Australian, I had an idea of them being monstrous....but the only one I saw was right near the end and it was smaller than the big monitor lizards.
I really loved the wildlife and though I didn't see a huge variety of birds (or that many), I did get to see lots of mud skippers close up, as well as some fun experiences with the squirrels and some tiny spectacular-coloured birds. And my favourite place to spend 15 mins was at the prawn ""lake"" where I enjoyed curious turtles, fish and squirrels. And no-one else came while I was there so it was lovely to hear the frogs start up and the birds and cicadas to resume their music.
This is one place I'll go to earlier next time.
I saw lots of water monitors in a range of sizes - both swimming and resting. I also had a lovely encounter with a lizard swimming. Just stopping and waiting is well worth the experience as critters start resuming their day-to-day life.

I think it's worth taking a taxi out there and being there by 7am if possible. And make sure to bring water and snacks (there's a water fountain at the Wetland Centre as well as toilets and vending machines but it's nice to have water on the walk).

A few pointers. Bring water. There are drinking fountains at the visitor's center, but not on the trails. Bring insect repellent. There are a lot of mosquitos in some places. Cover up or wear sunscreen. A lot of it has shade, but there are some places where you can't avoid the sun. This is a bit out of the way, which is one of the reasons the crowds aren't there.

2. The park is open from 7 am to 7 pm. Suggested that birding enthusiasts visit the park as early as possible preferably at 7 am.
3. One has to take a MRT to Kranji station. From Kranji MRT station, one has to take a bus (Route no. 925) and t down at Kranji reservoir Car Parking and walk for 10 ~ 15 minutes to reach Sungei Buloh Reserve. ON WEEK DAYS, BUS No. 925 DROPS PASSENGERS AT KRANJI CAR PARKING. (on Sundays & public holidays), bus no. 925 drops tourists at the Wetland Centre itself). For tourists visiting after 8.30 am, they can take KRANJI EXPRESS BUS, which will drop them at the Wetland Centre (HOWEVER THE BUS FREQUENCY IS ONCE IN 90 ~ 120 MINUTES.
4. From Kranji Reservoir Car Parking, the VISITOR CENTRE is a 5 minute walk, while the Wetlands Centre is a 15 minute walk.
5. The tourists can directly go to the mangrove forest (wetlands) area directly. Or they can take the Coastal Trail from the Visitor Centre.
6. The Coastal Trail is 1 ~ 2 kms walk (if you take detours) and get to see Barbets, Kingfishers, Black Hooded Orioles, Eagles, Egrets and a variety of other birds besides the Tree shrew (like a squirrel)
7. The Migratory Trail (Wetlands) is 2 ~ 3 kms walk (if you take detours). One can see the migratory birds and also the resident birds (Painted storks, Great Egrets, Intermediate Egrets, Little egrets, Kingfishers, Barbets, Oriental Pied Hornbill, Black Hooded oriole and a variety of other birds beside the Monitor Lizard and Crocodiles.
8. One can walk on bridges over a canopy of trees / mangrove forest / stay put inside observation decks (fantastically made decks) to observe the birds.
9. Major part of the park is wheel chair friendly!!!!
10. A NICE PLACE TO UNWIND YOURSELF. Minimum of 4 hours are required to walk around. If you can manage more time (you can spend more time in observation decks – without the birds watching you).
11. THERE IS NO ENTRY FEE TO VISIT SUNGEI BULOH WETLANDS.
12. The park I open throughout the year. The best time to visit is between October and March when the migratory birds can be seen in big numbers.",08-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 09:54:41.874773

At the wetlands, spot monitor lizards, giant mud skippers and even an alligator. There are many bird species, too many to list here. Most prominent are the herons. A Kingfisher or two flies over too but to fast to be photographed amateurly.

Immediately the soul finds solace in the open wet spaces and green, vacant places that make up this park.
No visit to Singapore would be complete for me without a visit here - the migratory birds, the water monitors and resident crocodiles surely would agree with me!

There are many trail choices here, ranging from 3km strolls to 7km exploration walks. They are very efficiently signposted and easy to manage for both young as well as the elderly. In fact, I think that the walkways were designed for folks like me that don't look where they are walking because they are focused on the wildlife, and the awesomeness of the mangrove swamps. Hear the cycadas calling, see the birds flying and smell the fragrance of what many parts of Singapore used to be like in the mud and water.

If you are quiet, you will witness nature as it has always existed here - insects, snakes, spiders, lizards - some of the water monitors I saw exceeded 5 feet in length! Here you will always witness flying fish and mud hoppers. One could spend entire days watching these unusual creatures take off or crawl across the muddy floor and even clamber up trees!
I even saw a crocodile. The slopes between the swamp and walkways are easily accessible to crocs and the staff at Sungei Buloh told me that if I happened to see a crocodile on the path, I should notify the wardens and they would chase them back into the water. Crocodiles, they told me, could be dangerous to little children! When I asked how many kids they'd lost, I expected the answer to be 'not enough' (because the trains are still over-crowded here) but they told me, to date, none that they were aware of. Perhaps the staff had just begun working there that day?

The bird life is abundant and the presence of the many hides from where photographers and nature enthusiasts can watch their 'rituals' undisturbed and in their natural habitat is most welcome!

I climbed up the lookout tower from where I could view the area and it gave me some idea as to where I was going and who I actually was and also it allowed me the freedom to choose what food to eat, which people to mingle with what peace to search for and which direction I should face while meditating (I only added this sentence to see if you were still focused on my natural outing or if you were merely skimming through the attached pictures).

You will be able to see crocodiles, lizards, beautiful birds, a variety of mangroves, etc. All along the way, there are great opportunities to inform yourself about the value of mangroves and their wildlife, starting with a well organised exhibition. We've received a guided tour, which was amazing in providing additional insights into reserve management, wildlife diversity, and importance for Singapore. You can easily spend half a day there.
You should make sure to bring some small snacks and water to stay well hydrated. A camera is your essential tool there. A high-quality camera with a good zoom would be good, as some wildlife will be a far away.

The rustic setting and lovely greenery calm one's mind and was a great relief to the hectic and stressful tempo of urban living.

Little do I know of the migration of hundred species of shore birds from the northern hemisphere to the south hemisphere of the Earth in search of warmth and food. The unbearable harsh winter accompanied by the scarcity of food prompted these birds to migrate in order to adapt to the ecological change .The risks were high. A substantial number of them perished out of fatigue and physical exhaustion. Many others ended up on the hunters' food plates while many more died of hunger.

It is fortunate that these birds could find a rest house like this wetland reserve for them to rejuvenate and recharge their energy so as to continue their long distance flight be it return to the north or migrate to the South. Color flagging and implanting satellites were interesting effort taken to study and monitor their flight pathway. One unconventional flight path discovered was the flight taken via the Himalayan mountains.

The work taken to preserve wildlife species from crocodiles to fruit bats, snakes, to migratory birds were significant, remarkable and impressive. I learnt a lot from our NPark guides during today's visit. The enriched learning experience invigorates my curiosity of the world of migratory birds.

There were a few hides/shelters to observe migratory birds. I understand the best time to visit and observe migratory birds is from Sep to Mar. As we visited in May, we only saw a few egrets.

A section of the wetland is the mudflat, where we could get close up view of the creatures - crabs, mud skippers etc. Fortunately, there is a boardwalk and rope balancing bridge to walk through the mudflat, without getting our shoes muddy.

Everything was okay until you finished walking and realized that at the other end of the reserve, there's no bus back (not operating on weekdays). Can't take a GRAB there either cause drivers would not pick you up at that area. So either take a taxis or walk back.

Hop off the MRT at Kranji (and be sure to visit Kranji War Graves before or after SBWR), and board bus 925C just outside the MRT station. The bus goes to an off-road bus stop where the buses can turn around. It's a five minute walk to the entrance of SBWR.
When people complain that Singapore's expensive, they should bear in mind that SBWR is one of zillions of attractions which you can visit free of charge.
I didn't see any macaques here, but it would be a nice place for those primates, so I'd suggest that you drink as much water as you like, but avoid eating anything so that you don't attract them.
Depending on how much of a naturalist you are, you could easily spend 3 hours here (amateur) or the whole day (serious naturalist).
This is a very well maintained nature reserve with boardwalks, viewing towers and platforms, bird hides and flat gravel paths. There are ample ultra-clean toilets, cold drink vending machines and plenty of rubbish bins, so there's no need to carry your empty drink bottles for miles.
SBWR is well known, along with Pulau Ubin, for being the home of the world's biggest mud skippers (the only known fish species to climb trees... a little way up). These unusual fish are very easy to photograph, as are the multitudes of water monitors and 'land monitors' (not sure about the name of this 2nd one). Most people, including professional photographers (check out the mountains of photographic equipment they drag around) come here for the birds. If you're adept you can get some great photos of birds, too.
For some unfathomable reason this first class nature reserve is uncrowded, in fact practically devoid of visitors, even on the weekend! You can commune quietly with nature to your heart's content! The professional photographers make up the majority of visitors, it seemed to me, and they tend to stop in one strategic place for hours waiting for that million dollar shot.
Just beware of the return bus to Kranji MRT! There's a bus stop just outside the front gate on the correct side of the road, so you might well stop here and wait... but this bus stop is only used on certain days of the week! So you could have a looooong wait! Check the time table posted in this bus stop to see if there's any chance of a bus! For this reason it's better to return to the wide off-road bus stop that looks like a small carpark where buses turn around. This is where you were dropped off, so it's easy to find. But wait! There're two buses with the number 925 and the other goes to some other MRT station, I think it's Choa Chu Kang. The safest answer to this bus dilemma is to ask the driver where he's going! I was told by a local that even the Singaporeans get mixed up and either sit for an hour at the rarely used bus stop, or hop on the wrong number 925.",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 09:55:49.568499

On this circuit we saw several monitor lizards, 6-ft crocodile in the river, baby crocodile along the shore, butterflies, white cranes and little fish jumping and making big splashes in the water. We took a break back at the Centre (the path is circular) when it started to rain, and 30 minutes later took off for the Coastal Trail.

We walked the wetlands boardwalk trail that leads into the forest at water's edge. On this day it was super low tide and it hadn't really rained in a couple of days (rare, I know). So lo and behold the mud flats were exposed in all their amazing diversity of appeal. Striped fish lazily wandered the small pools of murky water. Mudskipper fish wriggled and flopped on the mushy ""fields."" Huge herons in groups of 4 to 20 were noisily squawking or flapping or finding prey. Green-black, stealthy crocodiles lurked beneath the brown, almost inky waters between patches of forest and muck. A few even hauled themselves out on sloshy embankments to catch a few sun rays.
Down the crusty path we met monitor lizards aplenty. Some stood their ground, in the middle of the people path, and we had to back slowly away. Others quietly disappeared into the disarray of tree roots, dead leaves and driftwood. Then there were the crows, alerting us to monkeys who scampered along the fences or plopped down and sauntered across the path in front of us. So much to see! It takes time, a little quietness on our part, and the perfect tide, but it is very worth braving the heat and humidity to be seeing the primordial Singapore and imagining all that the visionaries had to accomplish in order to make Singapore the billion dollar trade and tourist hub it is today!

And I did!
It was lying on the muddy shore bathing in the hot sun. All thanks to the strategically placed viewing station that I could adjust my eyesight from the glaring sun ray to see the lovely creature which could easily been mistaken as a large piece of log!

Another lovely surprise was the slitting green snake on top of the wooden rail at one of the viewing board walk by the majestic river. I was really glad that the school children on excursion hunt were not around at that point to scare the beautiful snake.

We started from the carpark of the Wetland Centre, arriving on a quiet and misty morning (7 am). Peace and quiet prevailed as we crossed the bridge into the tidal pools. There, a circular trail leads around the tidal pools, interspersed with multiple hideouts and a lookout point across the Johor straits. Multiple glimpses of fish, herons and even a basking crocodile. Washroom facilities and vending machines are available back at the centre. We then headed south-east, towards the Visitor Centre, taking the mangrove and coastal trails. There, spectacular sights abound: the mudskipper pods ascending to a blinding view across the straits (with the eponymous mudskippers out and about), and then descending into the serene calm of the mangroves, before emerging onto the more lowland vegetation around the Visitor Centre. The entire round trip took a comfortable 2 hours. We came in the early morning, it was quite hot by 930 am, and just the right time to leave. This is the closest thing you will get to a true mangrove experience.

Do remember to equip with comfortable walking shoes, insect repellent, drinking water and a pair of binoculars (for bird watching). Oh ya, avoid wearing shorts to keep away from mosquitoes :) Another tip is to avoid weekend visitation due to the crowd.

The wetland which is Singapore’s first ASEAN Heritage Park was formerly used for spawning prawns and as a fish nursery but because of it’s rich biodiversity, it became a protected Nature Reserve in January 2002. It’s now very popular with bird watchers and nature lovers, who go there to take pictures and to enjoy the 202 hectares of wetland wildlife, the mangrove flora and fauna set on the mud flats, ponds and secondary forest.

On my first visit, I spent just over an hour to quickly familiarise myself with the place. The second visit with a friend was longer, as we walked the 1,300m Costal Trail from the Wetland Centre to the Visitor Centre and then back to the Wetland Centre to return to the car. On the first and second visits, it was low tide and the Reserve was not as attractive as the third visit when we spent 5 and half hours walking both the Migratory Bird Trail and Coastal Trail, walking a total of 5.51 km. stopping at every Hide to pause and wait for birds to appear. It was hide tide this time, and the scenery was so much nicer.

As I enjoy wildlife very much I will be visiting this place more frequently. I found it great for simply walking along the set pathways under the forest canopy, enjoying the natural tranquility. There’s no entrance fee. Much of the trails are wheelchair accessible. You can obtain free maps at the Wetland and Visitor Centre.
The migratory bird season is from September to March. But throughout the year you can still spot resident birds such as herons, kingfishers, bitterns, sunbirds, tailorbirds and fruit pigeons. Watch out for mud crabs, mud skippers, snakes, monitor lizards and crocodiles.

If you’ve not been there it’s certainly worth the visit.

Tips:
Use a good, comfortable pair of walking shoes.
Bring a camera with fully charged batteries.
Bring a pair of field glasses or binoculars if you have these.
Bring drinking water.The cafeteria at the Wetland Centre isn’t functioning now, and the ‘Mangrove Kitchen’ cafe at the Visitor Centre has ceased operations since June 2016. So bring your own packed meals or snacks if you intend to stay long. There are canned drink vending machines.These accept coins and $2/- notes only.
You may want to carry a hat, as parts like the Dragonfly pond, Mudskipper pond, are not shaded.
Certain sections have lots of mosquitoes, so bring along insect repellants.
There’s a Visitor Center in addition to the older Wetland Center. If you’re parked at either and walked to the other, there’s no looping trail. You need to back-track along the coastal trail which is some 1,300 m, to get back to your parked car.
Toilets are found only at the two Centres. Use these before setting out.
If you want to learn more, there are free guided walks conducted at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve every weekend. Check out their website.",08-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:56:15.236495

Spend about 2 hours exploring half of the park. Will come back another day to do the other.

Nice weathered day and a good shoes made walking very comfortable. Took the ""Coastal Trail"". Saw lizards, birds, spiders, squirrels and plants etc. Did not manage to spot the crocodile and monkey. Saw the Straits of Johor which separated Singapore and Malaysia. Also a kelong (fish farm) in the middle of the straits. Really peaceful and reallh hear the birds chirping. Witness the dam that separating the Kranji Reservoir and Johor Straits.

Enjoyed the slow walk through the mangrove swamp and the tropical rainforest. An ideal place to stay away from the city for a while.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:56:15.982482

I was pleasantly surprised to find so much nature, animals, trees and plants at this part of Singapore! Besides bird watching, you can easily bump into big spiders, crocodiles (look out near the coast), mudskippers! There are large spots of mangroves where you can view from elevated walkways and modern ""tree houses"". There is also a small museum near the entrance. Even after a rain, I do not get many mosquitoes coming around...walkways and signs throughout the reserve are well marked for easy access.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:56:16.385012

Bring binoculars.","There are 2 paths - a shorter coastal walk and a longer one inland. We preferred the latter because it was quieter. It was fantastic place for bird-watching> Even without binoculars, we spotted many different varieties of birds including flocks of migratory birds, plovers, herons, egrets and an oriental pied hornbill who bid us farewell at the carpark off all places. Should you meet the nature photographers, they are super friendly and you can ask them to show you the more exotic varieties. We saw a sunbird using one of their telescopic zoom lenses.

We had an orange snake cross our paths and we spotted numerous squirrels, lizards and spiders including a huge monitor lizard basking in the sun. The best and most erie was spotting a croc hiding in the shadows of the marshes!

Takes about 4 hours to cover both paths.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:56:17.103207

He even showed us the Buffy Fish-Owl asleep in its tree near the car park.
Ground-based life included a Mud Flapper, Monitor Lizards, skinks, a smaller lizard with orange-pink upper body, and massive salt water crocs . One was on a sand bank lying with its mouth wide open.
