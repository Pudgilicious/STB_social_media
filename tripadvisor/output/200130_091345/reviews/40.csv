We started from the Marang Trail climbed up ladders to the Mount Fabor Park, a short walk then led to the Henderson Waves which looks like Dragon from some angles. View up there is the greenery down there all the way to the sea and Sentosa island.

Very easy to reach via cab from Vivo City or Harbourfront. No bus or public transport goes all the way upto the park. Cab is the best option. A short climb to the bridge and you are there. Walk, look at the view across of the Sentosa,water, high-rises, greenery all around. I went in the daylight but it looks beautiful when lights come on. Take time to sit, relax with loved ones. The walk to Mt Faber is long. Alternatively you can comedown a stairway onto the road. There is a bus stop right there which can take you to nearest bus depot and MRT.Cabs will be difficult to find.

The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worthy of visiting and walking across, taking in elevated views of Telok Blangah and beyond. That it connects with Mt Faber extends the walk to a visit to another of Singapore's favourite tourist destinations. Visitors can get marvellous city and harbour views from the top of Mt Faber as well as take the cable car across to Sentosa.
Henderson Waves is part of the walkways system in the Southern Ridges, 10km of greenery extending from Labrador Park to Kent Ridge Park, to Hortpark, to Telok Blangah Hill Park, to Mt Faber.

Started our walk at VivoCity Harbourfront MRT station. Follow signs to exit D, Marang Trail, a moderate to challenging 15 minute hike up to Mt Faber. Views are fantastic up there. On the hinterland you can see the city skyline and public housing. On the coastal front, you can see Sentosa and the various islands. Enjoy the scenery! Walk further and you’ll come to The Jewel, a restaurant, as well as Mt Faber cable car station. An easy walk along the footpath. Be careful of traffic. You will then come to a fork (which is actually a loop). Taking the left fork is 700m to Henderson Waves, while the right is 300m.
We took the longer route. Reaching a Danish Seamen Church, we turned right round the loop. Within a few steps, we came to the big sign ‘Henderson Waves’. A beautiful man-made bridge structure. It was very cooling and slightly breezy.
Continuing the walk, you will come to Forest Walk, a metal trail that brings you into the forest canopy. You come very close to nature here, hearing the various birds and insects, plus seeing squirrels. We ended our walk here and returned via the same route after 2.5 hrs. The trail continues further if you wish to walk more.

It is a wooden bridge at a height of 68 meters and has an unusual shape that gives the feeling of waves. Singapore is one of the rare cities where you can enjoy walking through a dense tropical forest right in the middle of the city. A 2.5 kms long tree top walk is one of my favourite activities during every trip to Singapore.
A hour long downpour in the morning had the desired cooling effect and we headed for this trek. It is a thoroughly enjoyable climb that takes you through a forest track and offers spectacular view of the city from the highest point at the Henderson Waves.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 09:47:13.647937

We went shopping in Vivocity and then took the cable car up to the Mount Faber station. You then just go down to the road behind the station and head left following the signs for the Henderson Waves. It is well sign posted and a 10 minute slow walk (about 450m). You have to turn right shortly and follow a meandering road downhill. Keep to the path on the right and you'll soon come to a very clear signed entrance to the bridge.
The kids loved running up the sloped sides on the wave sections of the bridge and we spend a good 30 minutes here. At the opposite end there is a path on the left that tales you down the hill through some exercise areas with sit-up tables, pull up bars etc. Eventually you come to a car park and from here we got an Uber cab back to our hotel.

The bridge offers beautiful scenes of greener Singapore uncovered by skyscrapers. I visited Henderson Waves at dusk and lots of locals (couples, families, groups of friends) were hanging out there.

The green foliage of the forest and park area had shielded virtually every man made structure around, some of the tall buildings managed to show themselves though,maybe trying to still score a point for balance.
At this early hour on a weekday, a solitude walk with no one around within a five km radius was exhilarating. The bridge is designed uniquely resembling seven waves rising up and down the deck.
The bridge was made to connect Mt.Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Park a few years ago, the walk is about 1/2 a km and feels like a board walk.

It had started to drizzle a little and I started to walk towards the Mt.Faber park.
From here I could take in a panaromic view of the city, the dense CBD and a rainforest that was slowly opening up through the haze.

,1,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,646187639,16-01-2019,5,Most Reviewers Are Missing the Point,"Henderson Waves is one of the most brilliantly creative concepts I’ve ever encountered anywhere on Earth, and it is utterly unique. But having glanced through a dozen or so reviews, it appears that the majority of out-of-towners reviewing it, are missing the point. It doesn’t matter whether they give the bridge 5 stars or 2: they don’t get it! Some wax rapturous over the view from the bridge, particularly at sunset. Others complain that this bridge-top view isn’t worth the Ridges walk in Singapore heat. One fellow intimates that the unusual construction of the bridge is a clever way of overcoming some knotty engineering problem (perhaps meaning that the bridge bends in an arc from one ridge to another). The unusual construction is certainly creative genius, but I can assure TA readers that it has nothing whatsoever to do with any engineering issue at all.

Yes, the bridge does go over Henderson Road (see Henderson Road photo), and you do take it as the shortest and easiest walk from one ridge to the next. Yes, there is jungle on either side (see Jungle Near and Far photo). I’ll grant you that the view of Reflections on Keppel Bay from the bridge is remarkable, since its futuristic silver lines are in dramatic contrast to the verdant jungle below and the heat-shimmering strait beyond (see Reflections on Keppel Bay photo). Offsetting that, the view looking in the other direction is nothing to enthuse over: you get to see the Bukit Merah district including parts of Henderson Industrial Park: the only conceivable reason anyone would think that view was beautiful was if they owned Henderson Industrial Park (see Bukit Merah photo). You can improve on any of these shots of course, if you throw in a cute companion (see Cute Pedestrian photo). And yes, most important of all, there is that very, very curious way that this bridge was designed and built. As you walk across it, the pedestrian walk and its corresponding railing, for some reason goes up and down, up and down (see Up and Down Up and Down photo). Rather annoying; makes it more difficult to walk across.

But there’s one rather important item related to Henderson Waves that I cannot show you a photo of, and that would be Henderson Waves! Why not? Because no one on Earth can upload a photo of it into TripAdvisor. A video: yes! A still photograph: no; it simply won’t work. The Henderson Waves aren’t invisible. They were there when all these folks submitting their reviews were there, but the reviewers never saw them. Why not? Because, folks, when you are walking across that bridge: YOU are the Henderson Waves! And trust me, if you ever did get a good view of them, you’d agree with me that this is brilliant creativity on steroids!

Would you like to see them? Here’s the easiest way to do it. First, timing is everything: mid-morning on a beautiful weekend day is probably best, since lots of Singaporeans will be walking the Ridges with their families. Catch a taxi or Uber or whatever, and tell the driver you want to get as close to the Henderson Waves bridge as you can, on Henderson Road. They can’t stop directly under it, but they can get you within a reasonably short walk from it. Then, all you do is walk up to where you have a fine view of the bridge: you want to be south of it facing north. Setting your cell-phone onto video would be an excellent idea. Look up at dozens or scores of people above. All those people walking across the bridge, going rhythmically up and down, up and down, up and down. Those folks, up on the bridge: THEY are the Henderson Waves!

(Plan B, by the way, is to walk the Southern Ridges from end to end, but take the stairs down to Henderson Road at the bridge, and then back up again (the harder bit) after you’ve gotten your remarkable video, or at least seen the Waves. If you’re young and spry, Plan B should work for you.)

But remember: having one or two people walking across the bridge when you’re below simply won’t do it: that would be like looking for the waves on a lake during a dead calm. You want to time it to see 30, 40 or 50 of these human waves on the bridge at the same time, rhythmically moving up and down, up and down, up and down. I doubt there’s a Scrooge anywhere on Earth so mean-spirited that he wouldn’t get a hearty laugh out of it, and start slapping his thighs. What a hoot! That, folks, is what put the Waves into Henderson Waves.

p.s. Answering a TA question, I put less than one hour to view the Henderson Waves, but trust me, if you include this as part of the complete Southern Ridges Walk it will take several hours.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 09:48:11.944611

But to call it a bridge isn’t doing it justice - it’s also an artwork. It’s the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. Built of timber, it gently rises to 78m at the western end. It’s also lit up at night, but I’m not sure that’s worth a special trip.

There are plenty of buses to Henderson Road (Google Maps will help you here), and then a stiff climb up steps to get to the bridge itself, or walk on from Mount Faber.

Overall we found this formed a decent attraction on the Southern Ridges Trail. I felt it wasn’t spectacular and if you are visiting Singapore for the first time I would say this isn’t a ‘must see’.

The bridge and all around has cameras and it made me feel safe.
All the environment and atmosphere is just reenergising and fill us with peace and gratitude.
I didn' t do the full walk because it was to long for me, instead I took the bus 124 in a bus stop at Orchard Road and I asked the driver to let me out at the closest bus stop to the Henderson Waves. He was very friendly and showed me the steps I should go in order to get there. It was a steep step to get to the top, but the bridge was there!

From there I went for a walk in what they call Tree Top Walk.
That was the best experience for me. Not because of the beauty only but because of the feelings it brings. Imagine you walking above the top of the trees...
The bridge is totally safe and you can see under your feet the trees, relax with the birds singing and being surprise with the contrast view between the amazing nature and the city in the background!

For me to come back to Orchard Road and have all MRT stations I just got the bus 166.

Highly recommend !

(Not recommend for people suffering from vertigo. But there is a solution, just walk straight for 300 meters without looking down.)

View is awesome! Tall buildings side-by-side facing north, and greenery by Singapore Strait facing south.

Take your family here and allot half a day in order for you to enjoy the other attractions at the Southern Ridge. Spend bonding moments with your kids at Mt. Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park, 2 areas connected by Henderson Waves. This is a great way to enjoy nature in Singapore. I encountered a couple of squirrels by the road on the way to the bridge. I heard you may even meet monkeys along the way.

Some tips:
- Don't forget to wear light comfortable shoes for walking a couple of kilometers.
- Transportation should not be a problem. Bus, taxi or car. I travelled by car and parked at a small lot right at tip of Faber Loop. Then, I walked a few hundred meters to the bridge.",01-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 09:49:58.284055

The bridge itself was only 300m long. And there are stairs (don't worry) to go up. You can go here using bus since the bus stop is right under the bridge, google the bus number! Or you can ride MRT to Harborfront then change to the bus.

Tips: go here when sunset comes. It is busy with runners, but the scenery was beautiful. You can see the city of Singapore at the bridge. And don't forget to bring mineral water or snacks and enjoy the view.",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 09:51:17.367951

I love the design of the Henderson Waves, and come here often with a good book or my journal. I love resting on the wooden sides and watching people go by. It's also a great place for exercising, you can run up Mt. Faber, through the Henderson Waves and down the Southern Ridges, all the way to Kent Ridge, or the other way around. Also a great place for picnics with friends!",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:51:46.194285

This time I passed through as a component of the longer Southern Ridges walk, but it was still interesting to stop here and admire the architecture of the bridge.

It is a unique bridge, though looks nicer in photo than the real bridge. However it was an awesome experience climbing up the stairs to reach this bridge.
We took MRT, alight at Redhill and take bus 145 but we lost in the middle as we cannot find the exact point to alight from the bus.
*We were supposed to alight before Telok Blangah Heights
Asking to some local and extra walking, we finally find the stairways to the waves! (Yeay)
Our track is from Henderson Road, this track is not recommended for elderly or little children with difficulty to climb stairs.
The overall park is very big and nice but at that time we were short of energy supply.
If I had another chance and better physical stamina, I wish I could explore the whole park.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:51:53.458740

There are place along the way to sit in the shade and have a rest if you need too. we didn't see any monkeys(warning signs) but old ladies were feeding cats at the ends of the bridge.",11-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 09:51:53.842999
