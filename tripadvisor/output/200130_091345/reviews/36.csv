From food to pastry, desserts, clothing, souvenirs, artwork, colourful antique chandeliers etc. the stuff are actually fairly priced. As it an open aired shopping street for browsing leisurely you could possibly spend a couple of hours here so for those who perspire or burn easily, I’d say dress really light and don’t forget a sun hat.

Sure, there are shop house with stores selling Arabic souvenirs and other items imported form the Middle East, as well as restaurants. But for me it was nicer to look along some of the smaller roads off Arab Street such as Muscat Street which I found far more interesting.

Along Muscat Street directly perpendicular to the main entrance of the Sultan Mosque can be found a really nice row of Turkish restaurants selling Turkish and Mediterranean food and many stalls selling all kinds of street food.

On the other side of Arab Street is Haji Lane which is a colourful small street with lots of eating places and stores selling all kinds of original goods. This street has quite a lot of walls covered with lots of artistic graffiti.

Often people talk about visiting Arab Street, but when here one should visit the Sultan Mosque, the Malay Heritage Centre, Haji Lane, Muscat Street and some of the famous Indian Muslim restaurants that can be found in this area. Also, the famous Bugis Street and Bugis Junction Shopping Mall is only a 10 minute walk from Arab Street.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-30 09:14:10.219259

Now when I reached there at about 10 pm it was dull,dark and nothing tbh. A very small street with just a few not very impressive restaurants but I still went to a restaurant and gave it a try.
The food was good but you can’t go very wrong while ordering a pizza and not Arab food!!

So thought to go early the next day for some Arab food. As I went around at 9pm it was still the same but I tried the Arab food and was very very disappointed. The food was stale and the restaurant was clumsy, mismanaged and super expensive.

Don’t waste your time and money here rather if you are a fan of Indian food especially veg little India is not to be missed!!!",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 09:14:18.052946

Arab street as said is just 50-60 long where all have a photo with the palm surrounded by restaurants almost all halal Muslim oriented ending to a mosque which is closed to tourist. You will definitely cover the area within 5-10 minutes.
However there are some other things around e.g. Malaysia heritage center and few parallel streets with bar and restaurant s which looks cozy.

We'd planned to do lunch at Arab Street. There are many Muslim food joints and Arabic/ Lebanese kebab- food kind of joints. We went to Zam Zam as that was the quickest to spot plus we were starved after walking the Zoo for 4 hours!
After lunch, we visited the Sultan Mosque which is right opp. Zam Zam Rest. We went to Muscat Street which is behind Sultan Mosque and found a cute souvenir shop called 46 Table Top Creation. We picked up many souvenirs from there (3 sets of 5-6 keychains for $10, etc). We realized that there are many more shops further down the street for cheaper souvenirs as well.
Next, we walked through the Malay Heritage Centre which was on the way and clicked a few pictures there, nothing too special.
That ended our trip to Arab Street.
Haji Lane is parallel to Arab Street and is a tiny lane with some wall graffiti art and few bars, cute. There is a Bergs Gourmet Burger; their beef burger is a must try! It does have other branches, so you can check out which one is closest for you.

Everything is laid out clean and colourful and the shops also are quite laid back with no one in a hurry, even to sell! Being possibly a heritage location, prices aren't really low and there's no sense of urgency to make a sale!! So browse to your heart's content and if something catches your eye, well & good. We had lunch in a sidewalk eatery called Bushra Cafe, mainly authentic Turkish food. For starters we had interesting bread with several dips of Hummus etc followed by Aubergene with tomato based sauce, Rice & Gemuse Roulade. The cooling drink of choice was Airan for the hot afternoon! A throughly mouthwatering spread, all told.

This was the first time I ever heard this call in Singapore as Kg Glam has been declared a National Heritage.

Good - as this spices up the tradition of the Arab Street, the Malay heritage, and the environment reminiscent of the early 1900s when major parts of Singapore were owned by the wealthy Arabs.

And above all, this shows the cultural richness of Singapore and preservation is the way to go.

Not quite rushed, however, to prevent us from appreciating the charm of Bussorah Street. With its pedestrian space, the two rows of tall palm trees that line it, plenty of shops and quaint restaurants, Bussorah Street is one of the most pleasant images of which I cherish my memories, in all my trip through Singapore and Malaysia.
I am of course aware that the tourism's needs have now strongly modeled these spaces, so that it's difficult to see how they were when they were organized according to other rules. But this applies to all the tourist sites; and in this case the result seems esthetically very valuable.
I have only one regret: not being able to sit down to dinner at a terrace of one of the restaurants, because ... it just was not yet time for dinner.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:24:12.372797

It was so named because this area was designated for the Arab community in Sir Stanford Raffles' 1822 town plan for the development of Singapore.

Despite its official name, Arab Street was often called Kampong Java by local Malays or Jawa Koi (Java Street) by local Chinese.

The Javanese had moved in and set up business in eating houses and food stalls, and selling food and vegetables. The Javanese women also set up flower stalls, which gave rise to yet another nickname for Arab Street, Pookadei Sadakku, which is Tamil for Flower Street.

Overtime, the Javanese influence diminished and it is again a predominantly Malay street.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:24:13.771553

Now coming to why I wasn't thrilled about this place. Let's break it down to all the reasons why one might visit this place, and why not one of those reasons is a big enough pull for me.

Well, for one, the textiles, beautiful prints and nets and more, are expensive. We find such stuff in Indian markets too, if you are looking for it. The quality and styles might be different, but then, if you have ample time or the pocket to spend on such expensive material, it might make some sense for you.

Next, the lanes and streets. You get a feel of the place. Each city / country has its roads and houses built in its own unique way. But then again, if you are visiting Singapore as a tourist, you will get a taste of the same at another tourist site.

The food, yes, there are some interesting small restaurants. But then again, nothing you might not get elsewhere in Singapore.

The mosque, its nice, the highlight of this place actually. But then again, I have seen bigger, grander mosques.

Historical significance of the street / mosque : well frankly, that's something I don't know about, since I haven't researched it.

I felt that I could have better spent my limited time in the country visiting some other attraction.",07-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 09:24:58.837558
