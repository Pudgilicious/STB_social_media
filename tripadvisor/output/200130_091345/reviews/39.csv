We actually came across a large group of young monkeys , one Mum and newborn too!
Super cool for our little one to witness them getting up to their antics.
After watching a group of kayakers (we couldn’t take part as children have to be at least seven years of age), we headed anti clockwise onto the boardwalk until we came to a path in the jungle and headed back towards Mushroom Cafe.
En route he got to see a monitor lizard, large ants , a centipede and also to walk along fallen logs.
Then we hit the Cafe for a cool drink,and delicious curry puffs.
It was a fun way to spend a couple of hours.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 09:40:24.368273

There are quite a few trails to choose from but we went with the blue one which took us to the tree too walk. It was incredibly humid and was a long trail but we thoroughly enjoyed it! Great for a break from the hustle and bustle of the city. We even got caught in a monsoon like downpour at the end of our trip!,07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 09:40:24.648962

All completely free for you to wander around - although you have to stick to the trails. This gives you a real taste of the jungle albeit very close to the city. Extremely well controlled and natural - so there are no vendors selling fast food - which is the way it should be. You can stop off at the ranger's huts to fill up on water and use the loo but otherwise that's it. We saw terrapins in the reservoir, some bird life and macaques but on the whole this is more of a nature walk with useful signage occasionally to tell you about the plants and their purposes, there are even Durian trees there. The skywalk is well worth a visit, again completely free it is amazing to walk at treetop level. This can involve a lot of walking and climbing steps up and down which in the heat is exhausting however still worth it. Also - not very busy which makes a lovely change.

One can have a simple walk along the boardwalk surrounding half the lake. Sometimes good size monitor lizards can be seen, some crossing the board walk to go into the forest.

Or walk/run along the unpaved trails within the forest. Be careful of the runners especially on weekend mornings.

Starting from the main car park or the bus stop after all the plant nurseries, it will take 3+ hours walking along the boardwalk, to the ranger station, to the hanging bridge, back by the ranger station, and along the dirt path return along the otherside of the lake. Finish at the cafe with a cool coconut juice.

What an awesome time we had spend exploring the nature and feet good. We were just walking and walking and only walking... Such a peaceful, serene and feel good atmosphere one can experience here!!!

We both love nature, so I took him for a little walk in one of Singapore's little rainforest parks - the MacRitchie Reservoir Park. The Park is also home to the HSBC Treetop Walk - a suspension bridge, which allows you to get up close to the flora and fauna from high up.

However, in order to properly appreciate this Park, you need time and energy. We arrived at around 8AM, walked the entire trail (approx 11km) and left the Park at about 1PM. Hence, I would only recommend this Park to people who:-
(a) can afford more time in SG than a Singapore Airline Stopover;
(b) can stand walking for hours in the tropical heat and humidity;
(c) are not afraid of monkeys and snakes. :)

What to wear and pack?:-
- Cool and breathable cotton clothes.
- Good walking/hiking shoes and socks - we did our walk in sandals, but I wouldn't recommend it. You can get nasty twigs piercing your toes. (ouch!)
- Water (we had 2 litres between us)
- Small towel (I sweat like no tomorrow)
- Sun protection (sunglasses, hat, umbrella, sunblock) as some parts of the Park are not shaded.
- Natural mosquito repellent.
- Your camera of course! :)

How to get there?
Take a public bus and alight at Bus-stop ID: 51071 - MacRitchie Reservoir.

Gentle reminder:
Respect nature and do not litter. Please speak softly and do not create a racket. There'll always be some inconsiderate people around who has a disability to shut up, but we don't have to degenerate to their level.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 09:42:12.519896

This time we came on a Sunday, and found everything very crowded. Both café and toilets were adequate for the visitors, but paths were difficult. The park was fine, but the walk into the forest was difficult. Seeing any wildlife was hopeless with so many people around.
We enjoyed a tasty reasonably priced lunch at the café, service was quick, and we always eat there.
We wanted to walk the Prunus boardwalk, but it was rather narrow, and had no handrail. With a number of uneven boards, we both felt nervous, and soon decided to leave. This will only affect those with disabilities; I’m sure healthy visitors can cope, I’ve always been able to do the walk in the past.
It’s still a great place to visit. But if you’re disabled and struggle with uneven surfaces, then come on weekdays when it’s quiet (so you don’t constantly have people trying to pass you), or just enjoy the park, and don’t follow the trail around the lake.
To get there, take a bus or taxi from the city. Leaving by bus is more difficult, because the buses are on the opposite side of a busy road, you have to use a bridge with lots of steps to reach them. Again, only a problem for the disabled.
It makes a great change from the city, and a good opportunity to see the more rural side of Singapore.

There are also gardens to explore with two restaurants the mushroom cafe and a bistro. Check which day you go as some parts were closed on the Monday we visited. The mushroom cafe for good for light meals snacks and refresments, its open from breakfast till late.

N.B. you might encounter monkeys. If so heed the advice do not feed them, do not provoke them, slowly walk away.

We travelled there by taxi, there is parking off reservoir road, which is just off PIE junction 20 onto Lornie Road. Good bus services:- nos 52,74,93,157,165, 852,855 and the MLT CC17 station is a short walk away.

One of the trails is about 11km long, it seems to be a mixture of forest track and board walk on water's edge, cycles are not allowed on it.

Fishing is allowed in one part only.

Mushroom Cafe has mediocre coffee, OK food and rather grim service.

Both me and my hubby, we just did boardwalk along the water. I was very nice and peaceful. This place wasn't busy even on Sunday afternoon.

We only saw a few butterflies and a dozen of monkeys yesterday. Monkey weren't friendly here. You can't get to close. Do not carry plastic bag with you.

Do bring bug spray though, there are a few mosquitos about, not terrible, and a water bottle. There are places to refill, but particularly the walk back from the bridge can be very long without water. Also, we encountered a monkey on the bridge, who stalked past us and hired menacingly at my daughter, when she studied him too closely. (There really was nowhere for her to go, they were both “trapped” on the bridge). She escaped with nothing more than a bit of a scare, but it would probably not have happened if she had taken the sign to “Not stare at the monkeys” more seriously. Monkey passed me without incident.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 09:43:50.341028

So, before coming to Singapore I did a little online reading on best places to run. The MacRitchie Reservoir came up quite a few times, so I had to go and check it out...

The closest place to enter the park, if arriving via public transport, is from the Marymount MRT station and walking about fifth of a mile to reach the proper park entry via underpass under the MacRitchie Viaduct.

The trail is well marked by signs and distance markers. It's approx. 11 kilometers long. I ran in the proper, counter-clockwise direction, which is also easier. It starts with a few kilometers of rougher, sometimes hard-packed, sometimes looser, undulating gravel path. It can be quite muddy after rain. If you are lucky, you get to see some wildlife, too. I've encountered monkeys and lizards. The most of the trail is shaded from direct sunlight. About halfway through, you will pass by the Jelutong Tower, have a break in your run, climb it and enjoy the above tree views. Past the tower, it gets flatter and more open, the trail ground also becomes more wider, either dirt, or wood, or pavement path. You get to enjoy the views of nearby private golf grounds and the reservoir itself.

You will see plenty of runners, so it is hard to get lost, but you still can run by yourself surrounded by the tropical forest. I started my run at 5pm on Monday... Two hours should be plenty, even if you are a slow runner.

I absolutely recommended to jog around the reservoir, you'll love it, no matter the heat and humidity, just carry a small hand towel to wipe your sweat;)

PS: If you only want to stop by for quick views, enter in the same place, from the Marymount MRT station, the easternmost spot on the trail, and just walk left from there, or clockwise, for easy, flat 1-2 kms around the southern edge of the reservoir. You can then exit at the car park and walk toward Caldecott MRT station via Thomson Road to get back to downtown.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 09:43:51.313121

Quite a few beautiful walks and hikes. The water...the rainforest... the sounds of nature.... This was indeed my most refreshing and rejuvenating day in Singapore (despite the fact it's also the day I got sunburned the most and perspired to levels of my clothing soaking).

The Treetop Walk was nice, not just for the Treetop suspension bridge, but also for the actual walk there. One could walk from the main Lornie Road Macritchie Reservoir entrance, or from the Venus Road entrance (which would be the shorter route). I used the Lornie Road entrance and quite enjoyed the longer walk.

On my way to the reservoir, my taxi-driver was just plain amazed and surprised to hear my destination...and then he just continued to literally laugh out loud at my choice of destination!!! :) He insisted that ""only joggers go there"" and laughed that I ""must be a very good jogger""! He then continued to dish out the touristy spots to me, telling me ""usually people go to Gardens by the Bay, or Botanic Gardens, or the zoo...""!!! ""Are you sure you still want to go to Macritchie??"" Hehehehehehe, it was a hilarious trip - especially so for him, as he couldn't stop laughing :)) He even wished me good luck when he dropped me off!!!

I walked/ran around the whole reservoir 11km and it took me 3hours. I did stop to take photos a fair bit.
I wouldn't recommend walking the whole track if you are on vacation as it leaves you pretty exhausted for the rest of the day.
There are signs with maps the whole way letting you know where you are and shows you the different trails and where they lead.

I would recommend starting at MacRitchie Nature trail (on Google Maps) which is a 5 minute walk from Marymount train station on the Circle line. I saw a bunch of monkeys chilling near the water which was really cool. Head straight, along the path by the water.
After about 20 minutes of walking, you'll eventually get to a board walk. Head along that until it ends. You can then head back the direction you came on a tree-top walk.
If you do choose to continue I suggest having at least 2Litres of water each and you can refill at the Rangers station around the half way mark.

So easy to get to.,"I had a day to spare so decided to take a walk in nature rather than around the malls. Best day out. MacRichie Reservoir walk is really pretty, and most of it is either within the trees, or around the lake and you can't see or hear any part of the city.
It is easy to get to: I took the MRT to Coldecutt station, and then had a 250m walk to the entrance by the dam off Lornie Road.
I then started off in an anti-clockwise direction up towards the ranger station. After a few hundred metres around the lake edge the Nature Trail headed into the trees and the next few kms were all in shade.
At the top of the park is the ranger station which offers toilets and drinking fountains. Note that other than at the bottom by the dam (where there is a food counter and vending machines) there is nowhere to buy food or water. So carry what you need.
The treetop walk is just a single span suspension bridge that gets above the tree canopy. Well constructed and solid. LOTS of stairs going up to and down from the walkway.
After completing the tree top walkway you have the choice of returning the way you came or carrying on around the lake. The second half of the walk is very pretty around the end of the lake and adjoining golf course, but much of it is exposed to the sun so make sure you bring a hat and sunscreen (and of course lots of water). Much of the complete 12km walk is on boardwalks (which are well constructed and maintained), but there are short sections of gravel path that would preclude disabled access.
All up about 12km in distance, which took about three hours. I went on a Sunday and it was busy but never obstrusive.

- Safety: always stay on the marked trails.
- Never feed the macaques. This is serious: you could incur a S$500 fine. If you feel uneasy among them, either back off or walk past them, gently and quietly.

Not steep gradient so the hike is not too strenuous. Most of the hike is in the shade and was bug free.

Some tips:
Bring plenty of water- there is no place along the walk to get some- Singapore is smoking hot
Bring shoes that will accommodate light muck. The trail was generally dry but that’s because it did not rain that day. Since much of the hike is on light gravel/ dirt it will muck up quickly. You do not need hiking shoes just don’t stress if your Nike’s get dirty.
Try and get out early in the am to avoid the peak heat
If you want to see monkeys( which we did), hike near the golf course

This is about 20 minutes by taxi from Orchard Road. There is no nearby MRT station. This is a delightful way to stretch your legs after a long flight or before you leave Singapore.

You soon leave the bustle of the city behind and walk into a mature green forest with a range of woodland walks, from very short to 11 kms. The reservoir looks much more like a large natural lake than an artifice because the waterline follows the contours of the land and the trees are tall and crowded (mostly secondary forest but some primal).

At the entrance, there is a small restaurant serving simple food and toilets. Use these before you set off on a long walk, because the next toilet is one or two hours walk, depending on whether you walk round the lake anti-clockwise (one) or clockwise (two). Take a water bottle too, because there is little shelter on the route and the climate is very humid. Don't even start walking if thunderstorms are possible, because you will be exposed to falling trees and lightning. Take sturdy shoes or trainers, because while some of the path is a boardwalk, other parts are rough forest with exposed tree roots.

Monkeys are everywhere, which is charming provided you don't carry bags that look like food. Males are especially aggressive, so take a stick with you to warn them off. You might meet a monitor lizard on your path, which look more fearsome than they are at up to 3 metres long. I once had a snake cross my path too and birds and butterflies add their own beauty to the walk.

Allow 2.5 hours brisk walking to complete the longest walk or more if you stop to admire the many lovely sights. In all, it is a real tonic for the eyes and lungs if you have been too long downtown.",11-2016,Business,2020-01-30 09:44:50.248555

It's also a good place to see wildlife - I saw lots of Macaques, birds (if you start early enough in the day), fish, monitors, skinks and a water monitor. The treetop walk is good, and the Jelutong tower is worth going to to see more views across the top of the forest and Singapore. The best bit is possibly the Chemperai trail, a boardwalk on the Southern side of the reservoir.
Googling ""chemperai trail macritchie pdf"" will get you the leaflet for the reservoir showing the trails. I started at Marymount MRT at the Eastern end and walked the MacRitchie trail to the treetop walk, the track to the Jelutong tower and then back down the West side of the lake and back to Marymount. It was a great morning, but you do need to remember to take lots of water - I didn't have enough, and I was really glad of the water fountains at the Peirce Track to refill water bottles.

In fact you're at the Mushroom Cafe (also called Setia) which is ideal. Have a quick snack or a meal, fill your water bottle, visit the near by loo, & you're off! Otherwise MRT Marymount is just as convenient.
Everyone wants to walk across TTW (Tree Top Walk) with good reason! Stunning views, especially if the weather's nice. You'll be warned half a dozen times that TTW has One Way Traffic Only!!! It's very narrow (basically no overtaking slower people) so the one way rule is quite reasonable. I thought I'd like to do the TTW, walk around the circuit and back to the start and do it a second time... but I was misled by the map. What looks like a short circuit is actually quite lengthy, and there are so many other parts of the park to visit, that I didn't bother. But I crossed behind slow people, so I saw plenty from TTW anyway. One very important consideration: TTW is closed for maintenance every Monday! So pick another day to visit!
After TTW you continue southward and come to Jelutong Tower which provides nice views. Throughout the park you'll see a plethora of birds, possibly macaques, definitely monitors and terrapins... and if you're improbably lucky a pangolin (but they tend to be nocturnal).

Continuing south you go over a tiny bridge which spans a stream which is full of very large terrapins. Have a close look at the walls or parapets or whatever you'd call them on either side of the bridge. These are historic and assumed to be built by POWs during WWII. After the bridge you come to a small clearing on the left with a view of MacRitchie Reservoir. If you look closely you'll see some white sticks poking up out of the water. These sticks indicate where the bridge built by POWs used to be. Looking across the Reservoir you can see a dark hole in the wall of foliage. That's where the Syonan Jinja (built by POWs) used to be.
You can continue south and visit more of the Reservoir, or skirt around the side of the golf course to gain access to PIE (the Pan-Island Expressway) where you can snag a bus going to MRT Caldecott and MRT Marymount. You might be tempted to take a short-cut along the golf club roadway, but they have several signs which say 'please' don't walk on our roadway...

Weekday walks will be best if you enjoy the peace and serenity of the trails. You can enjoy the 'natural music' coming from the surtounding habitats. The rustling of the trees, the birds chirping, the monkeys chattering.

If you plan to reach the tree top bridge, it's best to put on your most comfortable walking shoes. Distance from the entrance is about 7km with some elevation. It took us about 1.5 hours to reach the tree top.

You are very likely to encounter macaques up close along the way and even a few monitor lizards. The TreeTop Walk (usually open between 9am to 5pm) is one of the highlights and offers a breathtaking view high up in the trees.

There are wooden boardwalks and stairs throughout MacRitchie Reservoir, which makes it easy to hike through even in rainy conditions. Bottled water, sensible walking shoes and mosquito repellent are must-haves. I was walking with some scientist friends and we caught a mosquito that was about to snack on one of us to identify what species it was and whether it was the dengue transmitting type (thankfully it was not!). Make sure you top up applications of mosquito repellent every few hours.

Around 2 to 3 hours is sufficient to cover a full circuit of the place including a visit to the TreeTop Walk. Kayaking and canoeing activites are also on offer around the lake area.

Wear dry-fit clothing as I can promise you that you will perspire. Bring plenty of water and some small nibbles as there is no cafe in the forest. Consider sunscreen and mosquito repellant. We haven't experienced any mosquitoes but the youngest one got surprisingly sunburned. Finally, follow the instructions on the road or you will find yourself wandering like us for 14 km in 30 degrees, super humid, hungry and thirsty. Anyway, it was well wort it, and I will be back here anytime ;)",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:46:27.342165

My problem with this park is the monkeys. A friend of mine got attacked by a monkey because she was holding a banana. When we were trying to do a famous ""tree top"" walk, there were so many monkeys and some also tried to attack us. If you go there, make sure you don't bring any bag with you as they go after bags and try to grab them.",08-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 09:46:28.054271

Part rough trail, part smooth trail and part board walk. If you enjoy running this is a challenge you'll not want to miss. Start by 8.00 and drink plenty of water, it's hotter and harder than you imagine!
On the run I saw a snake, cloud lizards, water monitors, horn bills, long tailed drongos and troops of monkeys!
So take your trainers and give it a go!!",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:46:28.742689

This park gives you reason/motivation to run. You need to start very early to reach top bridge before its too hot. Smallest trail will take atleast 2-3 hrs depending on you speed. Keep some water with you.,10-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 09:46:29.402862

It has several trails which has different distances, good place to escape from the bustling of the city. The lake is huge, you can even do the canoing there, but we were exhausted after the walk...",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:46:29.737703
