It is a very pleasant place if you need to rest your legs and enjoy the cool and free air-con. So far this is the only art gallery/museum that has left me generally unimpressed. Perhaps better works were not showcased. So my advice is not to pay the hefty entrance fees until better art is displayed in the future. The Visitor Officers were just waiting for me to step across the line so that they can reprimand me in less than a second. I received a more hostile reception than my 6 year old son when he crossed the line to have a closer look at Mona Lisa in the Louvre. This also happened once when I was just reading a plastic plaque whose fonts were too small for my old eyes. Anyway this is the most excellent reflection of the Singapore culture. Just walk around the place and admire the architecture. A better place to see the real Singapore would be the building behind called Funan.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:58.221211

First, I felt like royalty during my visit, every staff member I encountered was kind and informative. Second, since I knew nothing of the history of the building, I was so surprised by it, and I really enjoyed taking the audio tour on my phone to learn more about this.
As far as the art goes, I must admit I know very little about Asian art and I found many interesting galleries in this collection. I did see the Biennale exhibits and found them enjoyable, especially the interactive ones, though the numerous little short films were exhausting and not many of value.
Don't worry if you don't have any knowledge about what you are about to see, just go with an open mind.
I guess my only complaint is that the app was difficult to follow for descriptions of the paintings, this could be improved with a number system.",01-2020,,2020-01-21 17:31:59.401020

The gallery is in the south of Singapore near the Downtown Core area.It consists of two main buildings—the Singapore Supreme Court wing and the City Hall wing, each having 5 storeys.The galleries and exhibitions are in the upper three storeys.

The countless artworks are all unique and some of them are very interesting.You can learn a lot about the history of Southeast Asian countries in some galleries,while in others,you may find some obscure modern artworks.There are also areas for you to stamp seals on paper and take it home as souvenirs.There are specially designed children’s area so the young can also have fun.

It is a big blunder that my two other friends and I spent all our time in the Supreme Court wing,which made us miss all the interesting things in the City Hall wing.So if you are visiting the gallery and have limited time,please make sure you plan your time well and try to cover different areas,especially if it is your first visit.This will help you have a whole picture of the gallery.Another tip is that since it might take hours to visit it and the air conditioning is pretty powerful,it might be a good idea to to wear long trousers and bring a jacket.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 17:32:09.022750

The staff are nice and gave us a map, but it didn't help much. The artworks arrangement also seemed confusing. Some are arranged by date and region, but some are completely irrelevant.

We had our trip there yesterday for about 3 hours so as to learn more about cultures in Singapore as well as Southeast Asia.

The building used to be the Supreme Court and City Hall. When we arrived there, I was enthralled by its colossal structure with British architecture style. These two buildings are integrated through link bridges and a new basement level. Likewise, the foyer, which was what we first stepped in, was spacious and magnificent with many beautiful decorations on the walls and ceilings.The delicate internal designs of the galleries overwhelmed me: patterned pillars, intricate chandeliers and old-fashioned arches. As for exhibits, they are divided into different galleries based on their themes and time ranges. There are a wide variety of exhibitions such as 'Siapa Nama Kamu?' (which means 'What's Your Name?'). I could feel the various ideologies of people from different times in different exhibitions.

Different artwork expressed different wishes of people. For example, some of the artworks are so abstract that we could not understand the meaning behind them. However, actually the artists just used different materials or elements to imply their thoughts. When I understood the true meanings of the artworks, I felt very surprised and impressed by the artists' abilities in conveying messages. Some artworks look very mysterious yet represent the artists, longing for peace and unity between the different racial groups.

Since the temperature there is quite low, you may need to bring jackets or sweaters in case it is too cold for you. Secondly, food and beverages are not allowed into the galleries. You can put your items like bags in the lockers only with deposit of $1 per locker. Furthermore, visitors are to keep quiet in the galleries so that other visitors will not be disturbed. Most importantly, there are black lines on the floor in front of every artwork that visitors must not go beyond.

The National Gallery consists of two historic structures ——the City Hall and the Former Supreme Court. The gallery mainly showcased Singaporean and Southeast Asian Art. It has five floors. Each floor has different kinds of art,such as ink painting, landscape and performance art. They showed the history of Southeast Asian economy and politics.
The gallery divided into different themes and factions. You can find the art that you appreciate and favor.
Children can create their own paintings on the second floor where provided painting rooms for children.
Before you leave the gallery, you can paint a postcard by yourself at the entrance of the gallery with pigments offered.

When I walked inside,thousands of delicate artworks caught my eyes at once.

There are 5 floors in the gallery. Although all of them were great, but I'm still strongly recommend the third floor. Artworks there are mainly about South-east Asian history. Through these oil paintings ,it is as if you are taking a time machine and seeing the stories happen in the past.

The National gallery is really worth a visit. You not only can learn about Asian painting styles,but also learn about the local history.

To be honest, it is worth to pay a visit, especially the exhibition hall on the 3rd and 5th floor. ‘Between Declarations and Dreams’ collects some art works like ‘Forest Fire’ , ‘Dancing Mutants’ , ‘Age of Full Bloom’ . All of these works are less abstract, so it will be easier for you to understand the meanings behind them.

Last but not the least, please make a map of visiting route before setting off and find a guide to go with you if possible. In that way, you will understand the stories behind works easily.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 17:32:14.336484

As a part of our learning journeys to teachers and 18 of us scholars visited the National Gallery of Singapore on the afternoon of November 27, 2019 we spent 2.5 hours inside it to appreciate the artworks on display. It is spacious and contains two wings that are linked and five storeys . We were amazed by the grand buildings and their classical British architecture style ,but it is a pity that we only finished our tour in the former Supreme Court building due to the limited time.

The works of art there are quite interesting and thought-provoking. There are realistic works like ‘the Violinist’,’the Road Construction Worker’ and so on. These drawings look so real and depict people and objects in detail. There are abstract works as well : ‘Footstep’ which consists of rubber slippers , ‘A Non-visual Art which shows nothing on canvas .Though some of them may be confusing, introductions and explanations beside them can help us get a better understanding of them.

Since the gallery opened in 2015, it is the newest museum in Singapore .The environment is pleasant,well-decorated and well-equipped.It was an enjoyable experience for me but the temperature was so low that I felt cold and had to put on a jacket.When we were looking for artworks created in the 21st century the staff there pointed the way and explained the layout of the gallery. When we said we were not clear of the meaning of ‘I fry you’,a member of the staff explained the background of it clearly to help us understand . It is definitely worth visiting.

The gallery is really spacious and contains more than 8000 artworks so if you want to appreciate all of them, it may take a whole day .It’s a good choice to spare enough time to visit it .On top of that, it is very cool inside due to the air-conditioners so you could bring a jacket in case you feel cold.",11-2019,,2020-01-21 17:32:14.613110

My first impression of the place was that it was huge as there were two opposite wings: The Supreme Court Wing and the City Hall wing.
In the Supreme Court wing, I attended the Biennale exhibition where artworks of South East Asian artists were displayed. There were a total of 11 galleries with diverse topics and originality. They helped me a lot in understanding more about The South East Asian culture and history.
In the City Hall wing was the Siapa Nama Kamu? exhibition of Singaporean art since the 19th century. In addition to that, there was City Hall: If walls could talk, a cinematic display where you get to experience the history of Singapore. They were an engaging way to get to know more about Singapore and its history as well as culture. In addition, on the top level was a spectacular view of the city beneath.
Although I am not an art enthusiast, I found the exhibitions very appealing. The staff here are also very friendly. As a student on a class trip, I was approached by a staff who offered me help with my class project, which I was very grateful of.
For those visiting Singapore, this place is a must-go, especially if you want to find out more about Singaporean as well as South East Asian culture. Approximately 3 hours would be ideal for a visit here.",11-2019,,2020-01-21 17:32:18.404208

The National Gallery, from the outside it is a long huge building, but when we go inside, there are 2 buildings named City Hall and Supreme Court linked together by bridges. There are 5 floors and from the rooftop you can see all over Singapore, especially Marina Bay.

The Gallery is so big that I spent 3 hours visiting entire the space. I was impressed by the variety of artworks and the architecture. You will feel comfortable here because there are many air conditioners and benches in case you are tired. One of the most impressive points here is the behaviors and attitudes of guides and managers, they are very friendly and willing to help me when I need.

Do read about the rules, prohibited things before you enter the National Gallery and make sure you deposit your bag at the reception because it takes much time to discover the Gallery. Moreover, if you want to know more about the artworks there, you also can book a tour guide at the reception 😁.
