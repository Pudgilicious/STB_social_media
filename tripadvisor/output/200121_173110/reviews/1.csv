The smell so refreshing and the atmosphere was excellent.
Good to see the flowers from other countries under one roof.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:23.679479

A full day here is easily done. It's like a rabbit Warren with a hidden gem around every corner. We did all the dimes and the sky walk. By far the best thing we have ever done. Ingenious idea. Theres so much to see and learn about. A must fo for any one visiting Singapore,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:24.059361

,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/32thaol,740318717,20-01-2020,5,A must visit,What an amazing garden this was. There is so much to do and the light show at night is beautiful. We could have spent a whole day here unfortunately we only spent the second half of the day which was ashame as we didn't make it for the outdoor skywalk or enjoy any of the restaurants surrounding. Definitely a must visit when in Singapore!,01-2020,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 17:31:24.724296

The layout is very good with lots of information along the way. Water features are fantastic with the wow factor. Definitely worth the money and you can spend as much time as you want.",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 17:31:25.062882
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/O491CUjasons,740304975,20-01-2020,5,It‚Äôs impressive to see,"Gardens by the Bay was probably my favourite thing to see while in Singapore.

At night time with the light show everywhere you look is amazing and a real buzz around the gardens.

Great place to take the kids as they really enjoy the different lights and colours that are on show.

Personally I think it‚Äôs best to just stay in the free zone area and not go up to see views they are just ok.

I would make this a top priority to see while in Singapore and If time permits would go in daytime and nighttime to see the difference in atmosphere.",01-2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 17:31:28.972445
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Jonboys43,740200262,20-01-2020,4,Expect sore feet,"Having visited three times in three days, this place is brilliant and calming at the same time.
The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.

On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don‚Äôt do refunds üôÑ, sorry but that‚Äôs poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck. üò≥
So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....
Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 17:31:29.242825
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JitakPhuture,740175555,20-01-2020,4,Nice place if you love greens,"Got tickets for floral fantasy , flower dome, cloud forest so might well visit one time. All of three , I think cloud forest is the best. Waterfall and skywalk around the lush greenery is nice. Nice ride at the end of floral fantasy. Flower dome I think is not flowery enough. Overall a nice place to visit",01-2020,Travelled with family,2020-01-21 17:31:29.528535

It‚Äôs a wonderful experience. The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are full of gardens of the world set high in towering elegant glass structures through which you see Singapore laid out below. It‚Äôs unforgettable and totally inspiring!",01-2020,,2020-01-21 17:31:29.833227
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/rkmkdm,740168457,19-01-2020,5,A Don‚Äôt Miss Site,The Gardens by the Bay are not to be missed. The two domed gardens are spectacular. The path are easy to follow and not overly crowded. There are signs identifying each tree or flower. The wood sculptures are unbelievable. The free light show far surpasses going to the Night Safari. The lights dance to the classical music. Get there early for a seat on the steps. Standing and looking up for close to an hour is not comfortable. Hang back or immediately head for the exits as it is very crowded as the area empties. Access to the park is easy from the Bayfront MRT.,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:30.192214

There are places to eat by the domes, but the better place is Satay by the Bay which has many hawker stalls and a large variety of food. Since I had done free garden part of this 5 years ago, I did the other parts this time (the non-free domes and the free light show).",01-2020,,2020-01-21 17:31:34.112493

The Flower dome was closed when I came, it may be under renovation but the Cloud Dome is still open",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:34.394084
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/zoeellis85,740135148,19-01-2020,4,Beautiful to visit,"Great place for a visit, informative and lots to see. Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a ‚Äúhalf an hour‚Äù audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I‚Äôd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I‚Äôd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance. For these reasons I cannot rate it 5 stars",01-2020,,2020-01-21 17:31:34.689494
,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/martinb8,740126714,19-01-2020,5,Gardens with a difference.,"We spent half a day here between a cruise and a flight home. It's only a short ride from the Marina Bay Cruise Terminal (where you can leave you luggage). The super trees were super. Early in the day there are fewer people so we really enjoyed the Skyway, Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. It's surprising how huge the domes really are and they have unique displays. It's a pity we couldn't stay until the night time lights.",12-2019,,2020-01-21 17:31:35.044260

,1,1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ReluctantReviews,740076423,19-01-2020,5,Lovely üòä,"Very relaxing tranquil spot in the city.
The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.
Best to buy all tickets together rather than audio tour separately as we did. You would save a little money.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 17:31:39.524730

Plenty of restful places in the gardens, but a fair way from the Bayfront MRT, so you'll get a fair bit of exercise! The flower dome was a lot of a scrum when we were there, especially if you try and work your way around the masses of tourists wanting to spend ages taking pictures of their nearest and dearest in specific locations.
