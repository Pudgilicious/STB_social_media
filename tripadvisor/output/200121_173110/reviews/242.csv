It has a Starbucks as well as Cold Storage (an upscale grocery store). There are three levels, and numerous eateries on the third floor. There is also off-street parking in the car park.

The Nike outlet is located within the mall. Not really a big mall but Cold Storage is the anchor tenant here. Can get a bit busy during the weekends, especially the lunch and dinner hours.
