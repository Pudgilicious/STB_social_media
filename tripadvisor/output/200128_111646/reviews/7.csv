Carriages are very large holding up to 12 people. We were there in late August and were the only people in the carriage so we didn't have to push past others to take in the stunning views. Carriages move very slowly, I believe it took about 30 minutes for a single revolution.

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/glenndjangkar,707822971,08-09-2019,5,Unique View of Singapore,"Visited this site with my wife and son during the first night of our September 2019 visit.

As a first timer to this place, the best way to describe it is that it looks like a giant wheel that spins slowly and carries its riders to the top. Upon getting close, you realize how big the compartments are given that it seats about 10 and there’s space for people to walk around inside and enjoy the view.

As the wheel begins to take you up, there is a voiceover describing the things that you are seeing as well as promoting the various tourist attractions to visit in Singapore. A victorious-sounding jingle plays when your compartment reaches the top.

The Singapore Flyer is a safe place. You don’t feel the discomfort of going at such tall heights. I would advice you to keep a close watch of your children when going into or going down from the Singapore Flyer compartment. This is because you go on and off with the compartment still moving albeit slowly. Even so you should take care of your little ones.

Speaking on behalf of the argument of visiting Singapore Flyer at 6-7 PM, I can say that the highlight of the ride was seeing all the lights being turned on at the various buildings.",09-2019,Family,2020-01-28 11:17:27.117712

remember to get your tickets on the ground floor not as we did get upstairs and then to go down again.

the only down thing was that we had to have our photos taken - after the flight we bought two copies of two photos and were told we could download the others from a website - this I was not able to do and chasing the company they did not help at all

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/197219802009,693025716,27-07-2019,4,The highest flyer in the Asia,"This flyer is the highest in Asia and second highest in the world.

The best time for having a flyer ride is on weekdays and before sunset when you can see the day and also after sunset to see the city at night . To me , both are beautiful.

So, we got there at 6pm as the sunset was at 7:12pm. We purchased our tickets . The price of each ticket is S$33 for adults and S$21 for kids or child upto 12 years old. Each capsule or cabin's capacity is max 28 persons but normally when there is no queue , you can have your privacy.

The duration of flyer is 30 minutes .so, I recommend you to split your time in two 15 minutes : 15 minutes before sunset starts to see the day and places in the city. And second 15 minutes for after sunset to see the beauty of the night.

For example : if the sunset is 7:15. Then, you better get on board at 7 pm and get off at 7:30 pm.

Also, there are there screens giving you necessary information regarding the surroundings.

For those who are acrophobe, do not worry at all. You can not feel the hight when you are in the capsule. It is much safer than being on the plane. Moreover, the speed is very low and you can not feel the move and rotation at all.

There is a coffee shop under the flyer and Indian restaurant at the first floor and some shops .

To me , it was a good experience.

I have another tip for those who want to make a plan for the restime of the day. After finishing your ride,follow the river and go over the helix bridge to see the magnificent scenery of the city overlooking Marina bay and merlion. ..",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 11:18:02.642482

It had been raining on and off but was only sprinkling on and off during our tour. We were fortunate as this meant that we could ride the Flyer. The tour guide got our tickets while we relaxed after our walk there. Because of the rain there were not as many people waiting to ride. There was a wedding party and it was cute to see the couple so happy. We were fortunate that they allowed our tour party of 6 a car to ourselves. Looking out we could see many of the attractions of Singapore and out towards the ocean. When we got to the top we could look all around us as the view was not obstructed by any buildings. Would ride again as it was fun and a smooth ride. Might not be as fun if it was crowded but great first experience on the Flyer.,07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 11:18:11.979461

The capsule can fit in about 12 people and depending on the peak/non peak times, you can get the capsule all by yourselves. We went in the morning (around 11am) and there were a lot of tourist buses, so our capsule was full with 12 people. However, that does not make any difference as the inside is spacious and you can view the surroundings from different corners of the capsule.

The total ride takes around 30 minutes which give ample time to see the panorama and take photos. On one side, you can see the Marina area with MBS, Gardens and the Singapore river while on the other, you can see the city skyline. Great views and slightly different from those on top of the observatory in MBS

We were not sure if we would want to go for both Observatory and Flyer. After doing both, I would say it is worth if you go for both on different days (also, make sure you visit one of the attractions after dark as the city lights is something worth seeing)

After finishing the ride, dont miss the small garden below and especially the Koi pond in which you can feed the fishes for $1",04-2019,Family,2020-01-28 11:18:57.978282

My experience of getting to the flyer, however, left me hot and annoyed and the disinterest of the young staff in my comments about the lack of signage didn't improve the situation. The website instructions say to travel to Promenade Station, take exit A and follow the blue signs for a 5 minute walk. I could not spot any signs and although the flyer is visible, a construction site blocks the view of which direction to access it from. On arrival we followed the sign to what we believed would be the ticket booth and entrance, only to find that the ticket booth was the floor below and the other side of the building to the flyer entrance. There seemed to be no logic in this location as it was neither near the carpark or foot traffic.

There is a little garden with pond below the flyer. Good to get a few good snaps. The flyer round takes approx 30 mins. However keep at least 2 hrs to enjoy this place.

There is a souvenir shop at the end that you have to walk through to exit - but it had a wide range of goods - with cheap to expensive items so something for everyone.

There are food options in the complex as well - so it's popular with the tour buses - we did encounter a few while we were there.

It's beautiful. During the morning , evening or at night, this flyer offers great view of the city skyline and much more.
There are option for dinners to enjoy a meal here too. It's more of an attraction then a ride cause it's very slow and a full round takes over 20 minutes. Every minute is well spent and what a place to grab some amazing pictures and selfies for your Facebook or Instagram account.
There are a few food options located at the bottom and a cool souvenirs shop at the exit. Some things you get only at this shop and not at any other market like China Town or little India so don't miss out on the collectibles if you happen to like any.

They only filled up the pods with 12 people which was nice because we didn't have to fight with a crowd to see the views. I think this made the ride more enjoyable. In London, the Eye was so crowded, we didn't get as long a time by the glass to view and there was no place to sit while you waited to see the views. On the Flyer, we had lots of time and space to view the city from every angle and sit when we wanted. It was worth waiting a bit longer to have more room in the pods. The city is nice to view at night and there is great information available so you know what and where you are looking.

Singapore Flyer is the height of a 42-storey building – that’s some 30 metres taller than the famed London Eye.
It’s the world’s largest observation wheel (outside United States).
Taking a flight on this S$240 million wheel is a one-of-a-kind experience you wouldn’t want to miss.
personally, I won't recommend for the dining option unless you
- can dine with your eyes looking out of the pod while stuffing the food into your mouth.
- disconnect with your loved ones onboard as you can't talk with food in your mouth and your eyes stick to the fantastic view from high up.
- about an hour of sitting in the pod (2 rotations) without a chance to go relief yourself while you are stuck in the pod.
- just go for dining nearby and focus on the birds eye view of the city.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-28 11:21:45.146534

For those going from the MRT, it's a so-near-yet-so-far experience because of the bad signage. It gets worse when it is a hot day and you have kids in tow and you just wonder if you are going the wrong way. The escalator at the side of car park that leads to the overhead bridge to the Singapore Flyer building has no signs so I won't be surprised if many people end up jaywalking instead. And even if you use the overhead bridge, you will reach level 2, and then you realise that you have to walk a big round to reach the escalator that goes to level 1.

There are no seating area at the taxi area, and also hardly any seats for anyone who wants to take a rest without buying a drink. There are also no seats when queuing, which adds on to the bad experience especially when the queue is long.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-28 11:21:45.395076

We went there at night to fully savour the night time view with marina bay fully lit. The prices are reasonable for such an attraction and no long queuing was needed.

We went up to the platform and entered the cabin - togehter with a hord of mainland chinese and their free-ranging kids. These people turned out to be souring the experience due to their incredible and excessive noise levels and their fully uncontrolled, respectless and hyperactive kids.

However, the movement of the wheel is slow and one has time to see who the views are developing.

While Keppel Harbour with this great number of ship is impressive - more than Singapores East Coast - the real views are Marina Bay and beyond.

Standing out were the Gardens on the Bay, The Marina Bay Sands and the Durian. The overall experience at night was great - many good photos opportunities.

We will come back - not at daytime though, again at night time.

The Flyer's podium is quite underwhelming and better design and more points of interest could have been added.

There is some seating space in the centre and you can walk around all four sides to explore various vantage points. Each cabin accomodates about eight people on an average meaning it's not overcrowded but that also depends on how much of a waiting line there is to get in. Speaking of which - we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get in. Inside the cabin there also screens which offer you information about the various sights.

The flight was amazing, we had a cabin to ourselves which was fun and meant we could easily move around without disturbing others. The views are wonderful and it moves at a slow pace for the 30 min flight.

Loved it, wouldn’t necessarily do it regularly but certainly provided us with wonderful memories.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-28 11:22:38.393774

The Flyer gives you – a 360 degree – panoramic and absorbing view of the maximum city. This giant wheel is a marvelous piece of engineering, and has multiple air-conditioned-see-through-capsules for its riders, with a seating capacity of about a dozen. One revolution is completed in about 40 minutes and the capsules reaches to a maximum elevation of 165 meters at the top. From the Flyer, you will see the seaside, Flower Domes, Gardens by the Bay, Art and Science Museum, towering Marina Bay Sands Hotel capped with the Infinity pool at the top, Commercial Business District skyline, bridges and flyovers and a fading glimpse of the renowned Merlion Park.

View from the Flyer is stunning and truly mesmerising, which is even better in the night when everything is electrified, bright and colourfully lit-up, enabling the entire integration of the city attractions to come alive beautifully in its full glory, glow and glitter – a fantastic treat to the eyes!

It's a wonderful and one of the major point of attractions of Singapore & it covers all the major sight seeing from the air conditioned capsules.
For people with fear of heights... there's nothing to worry in Singapore Flyer, it's quite slow moving & sometimes you'll think is that even moving......

My family enjoyed the ride.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-28 11:25:03.905937
,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/moderntraveler16,573009885,13-04-2018,3,Best time around sunset! See both sun up and down!,"Personally if you have been on a Ferris wheel anywhere before, it's similar. When it's crowded they fit more people into a carriage, less when it's early or late in the day.

I recommend around 6.30 before 7pm boarding to see sunset which you can see the difference between Singapore in the day and night.

Otherwise, being a nature lover I don't like to be enclosed in a box, and I wouldn't visit attractions like that unless I am bringing family. Good novelty for people that never seen it and maybe want to get past the fear of heights. Moves so slow, you don't know you are so high until you look directly down. Tip is don't look down of you are scared. Just look straight into the horizon!

Good for couples and lovers, the later the least people, nearer to their closing time.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-28 11:25:04.160985

You can get similar views from the Marina Bay Sands roof, but this perspective is unique. We were concerned about the wait (we went on a FRI night, but it wasn't bad at all. I think we waited about 15 minutes and part of that is just due to loading the cars. Each giant ""capsule"" holds 12-20 people. When we were there, they were loading about 12 in each one because it wasn't too crowded. Some cars are for private dinners and are set up with tables, so they just went right on by the loading platform as they must not have been booked.
Under the Flyer, there are eating and shopping opportunities but we did not try anything.
Once you get in, there is glass all around on the ""cylinder"" shaped car. The views are very good. I think this is the 2nd or 3rd tallest in the world. It's taller than the London Eye. You go up roughly 540 feet. The ride does one rotation (takes about 30 minutes), so enjoy each view at each elevation as you will only be there once! The car moves ""away"" from the City first, so you move up slowly on the ""back side"" with better views to the north. As you come up over the peak, you get amazing unobstructed views of the skyline. We really enjoyed this attraction and would recommend it for sure. The night views were really spectacular. There is a good gift store at the end.

Marina Bay sands appears to be right across the street to walk, but is a 1.5km distance. So if you have old people or young kids plan accordingly to bring the cab right at the entrance of the Singapore Flyer.
Engineered to excite and thrill , but without the scare of typical flying wheels. The cubes are made of solid steel and glass. Through out the rotation and while at various heights you never feel unsafe or dizzy. Rotates at a snail's pace to give you loads of time to look around and click pictures etc.. The only times one has to pay attention or a little caution is when stepping in and out of the cubes. The Flyer continues to move and is not halted for boarding or deboarding.

This is located near the merlion park and offers amazing views of marina bay sands, Singapore sky line, merlion park, and also the channel leading upto port of Singapore.

The one thing that you should not miss while boarding the flyer is a camera as the 360 degree views that this wheel offers cant be captured from anywhere else (except of course the top of Marina Bay Sands).

If you visit during afternoon hours on a weekday then its not too busy and one can get the enjoy the views without necessarily worrying about the crowd.

I am disappointed with the selection of stalls and many stalls were closed! Food served here was also rather disappointing. Expensive hawker food that wasn't good. As a Singaporean I am upset as this is a bad representation of our local food! My advise to all tourist, eat else where before coming and if you do have to eat here do note that the food served here is not what we normal Singaporeans would approve of.

The highlight of the evening the Singapore Flyer is another story. Awesome ride ! And good view of Singapore skyline. Sunset would be a good time to go on this ride.

We went a week before the F1 race so we had the opportunity to watch the preparation of the race track.

The cost was reasonable I feel, even for a local. There are discounts available with the Passion Card, Krisflyer and your Singapore boarding pass (for tourists). Children under 2 get in free anyway but only downside is you cant bring your stroller along because it is inaccessible to strollers for safety reasons. But this also got me thinking - like what about people on wheelchairs? Didn't really ask but this could be an issue for those moving around on wheelchairs.
Experience in the capsule was pleasant. We were lucky to get a capsule all to ourselves because we visited on a quiet off-peak weekday afternoon. Good all round 360 view of the city skyline and bay area. You also get to see abit of a birds eye view of Gardens by the Bay which was nice since I haven't been there either.

Unlike other attractions that have run of the mill stuff, the visitors' shop has good collection. So if yore on a short trip take advantage of their collection of souvenirs. Is usually avoid these shops a they cater to captive audience. However wanted to share my own atypical experience.

It's definitely better viewing at night! At $33 per adult, it's not cheap but seeing Singapore's twinkling, colourful skyline at night makes it a memorable experience and you'll get some wonderful photos. Even if there's a queue to board the Flyer, you don't have to wait too long to get on as each capsule carries at least 20 people, though you probably won't have that many people in your capsule. The capsules are quite large, the ride lasts for 30 minutes to do a full circle and the capsule's movement is barely noticeable. If you don't like heights, you might find the ride challenging. The views at night are stunning and if you are on the Flyer when the SuperTrees do their nightly light (and sound) show at 7.45pm or 8.45pm, you will get to see the SuperTrees changing colours in synchronicity, a mesmerising sight and a photographer's dream. A highly recommended holiday experience.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-28 11:29:46.598225

We arrived around 5.30 and the attraction was pretty quiet, we purchased tickets (with 10% discount for presenting our SIA boarding passes) and wandered through the garden on the ground floor of the complex.
We headed up to board and were given our own capsule as there weren't many people there, I imagine it gets much busier as the sun starts to go down.

Our flight gave us great views over Singapore, high rises for miles! I imagine we could also see Malaysia. What would be welcome is a map similar to what's provided on the London Eye so you know what you are viewing in the distance.
We enjoyed viewing the formula one track up close too as it's right under the wheel.

All in all a good visit and we recommend it.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-28 11:29:54.707408

We got there around 9:00 pm and there was no line to get on the ferris wheel. They have 28 air conditioned pods, fitting around 28 passengers, we had a pod, we were a family of six adults and only had 3 other people in our pod. We loved seeing the city lit up at night, the lights were spectacular and really there is no other way to see it, you have a 360 degree view. The ride lasts approximately 30 minutes and is worth the 33 singapore dollars per adult spent.

This giant wheel contains 28 fully air conditioned capsules and an accommodation of 28 passengers each.
The 165 meter high Singapore flyer being honored as the largest giant wheel in the world is a fair answer to the official London eye.The giant flyer is a 30 minutes ride which gives a beautiful 360 degree views when on top especially during rain. However, the flyer doesn't allow experience during heavy rains to avoid any sort of damage.
The best time to hit for a ride is during the sunset when the skyscrapers are softly lit.
One can also have a private dinner at the flyer. The hours of operation are from 8:30 am till 10:00 pm ,costing 33$ (Singapore) per adult.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-28 11:29:55.293089

There was absolutely no queue at 12pm (lunchtime) on a Tuesday and we walked straight on, but if you had to queue (probably around sunset) then it would be in air-conditioned comfort, in total shade. As we left, a busload of Japanese tourists arrived, so I think we might've just been a bit lucky with timing!

We had a whole ""pod"" to ourselves - which was a blessing, as sound really does echo inside and noisy (excited) children can be abrasive (even if they're you're own...!), so I'd let someone else through if you won't be able to tolerate that and it looks like you might get paired with a young family.

The initial part of the ""rotation"" gives you a fantastic birdseye view of the F1 racetrack/pit lane below for any motoring enthusiasts followed by a great view to the Flower/Cloud Domes. The second half of the rotation provides the best photo opportunities - of Gardens, Marina Bay and CBD etc and you've had time to ""get used to it"".

The experience would be amazing at sunset, but was equally also stunning in the middle of a clear-sky day (as ours was). It's a well-oiled operation (excuse pun) and you feel very safe. There's no ""rocking"" or jolting. It's a cool feeling when you're at a similar elevation to the top of Marina Bay Sands ""boat"".

We were there on a day that had a morning storm and then intermittent showers through the day. The ride was closed in the morning and the staff were unsure when, or if, it would open.

We wandered around Marina Bay and then saw the Flyer was running so walked back and got on.

A little downside is that the ride wasn't really busy, no queues, but they still filled up the cabin with a large'ish group instead of spreading across a few cabins. It seemed as though this could've been easily done and enhanced the experience. We probably should've asked for that.

We walked through the green-screen photo room before the ride without realising that was where the photos were being taken to after he ride we had to ask the photo people to take us back so we could get a photo. No dramas, they were happy to help but could've been avoided.

The full circle took 32 minutes.

We went at night and my guess is that you get a better view than a daytime view. That's my opinion!

Best to visit in the evening around 6 - 7pm, so that we can enjoy the transition view from day to early night.

The nearest MRT/Train station is Promenade MRT station.

The Ferris wheel, or SINGAPORE FLYER as called in Singapore has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each can accommodate 28 passengers on board.

The FLYER revolves/rotates very slowly, we can take  photos as many as we like it, until at last we enjoy the view of Singapore from a height of 165m ( 541ft ) before we head downwards. All the way, we have panoramic view of Singapore.

You will surely enjoy THE RIDE.

You have small cabins which can accommodate 12-13 people. Staff there was kind enough to give our group separate cabin. Thanks to them.

The flyer goes very slowly and at time stops in between or on top to allow you to take view/photos. View from here is really breath taking and you MUST not miss it.

In morning we visited Marina Bay sand hotel's top and in evening we did flyer visit. This was good choice as we could see both views. I will recommend to do flyer in evening / late evening.

They offer entire cabin for couple with extra price. If you are on honeymoon , you must take this.

We thought perhaps there would have been an audio talk suggesting which side to look out of and what you could see but again nothing. Having not been to Singapore previously we thought this would be a good attraction to get a sense of where things are in relation to each other obviously not. We did see on exiting that there was some information points scattered around but we were confused as to why these would not be inside the pods?

The ride is expensive though (costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person) and the first 25% of the ride does not really have any interesting views except for the view of the ocean, part of the Singapore grand prix track and Gardens by the bay. It is only once Gardens by the Bay comes, that all the sights including, the Marina Bay, the Singapore Skyline, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay etc. are viewed with a mind boggling views. Get yourself clicked as many times with these different views in the background.

The one complaint I had though was the entire approach to actually finding the flyer is not very well designed and there should be many signboards. Also, the gift shops needs to have small models of the flyer to take back home and the staff in the gift shop could be a little more courteous.

There are plenty of helpful guides in the Flyer cars as well as on the walk through just prior to entering the Flyer. My kids loved it, and it gave us a good 30-40minutes of time to rest in the AC!

They should make it more affordable especially it an old attraction.
Although it much different product from MBS skypark, it gave almost the same view that one is seeking.
However , for first timer, one should never miss out.
Afterall, it one of the highest and biggest in the world and it rotates very slowly , you probably will not worry about height when you are into the capsule.
Lastly, if you are into a romantic dinner whereby you want to have with your loved one, you should consider this first attraction

During the day time the view is good to get an idea of the tourist attraction in the surrounding area.
This is place has boarding pass privileges if you travel Singapore air lines (they said this was not valid on public holidays did not see any comment about this on their web site though). If it is your first time to the location and will be visiting the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay and other tourist attractions around the wheel a day time visit would be best as you will be able to get an idea of the other location in relation to the Singapore flyer.

Also there is hawker center at the base of the flyer, we wanted to have a meal there but the place did not look very clean.

This is definitely a highlight on a visit to Singapore. The closes MRT is Promenade.

The access to the flyer by taxi is very convenient. By MRT you will have to walk about 5-10 min from the nearest station.
The backside of the arena has a nice view of Marina Bay Sands and other Singapore attractions. Might be a good idea to reach here during daylight for some photo ops.
You've go through security check before entering, and in case of babies, you need to park the stroller outside. There's about 200-300 m walk after parking the stroller. So be prepared to carry your baby in arms that distance. Each capsule is quite spacious and they allow up to 8 people in a single capsule. There are benches to sit inside the capsule. Apart from the benches, every capsule has a lot of space to walk around. The capsule is air conditioned and has transparent glass on all the sides that offers a nice unhindered view. It was safe enough that we could let our daughter walk freely inside the capsule. My mother who has fear of heights and gets motion sickness sometimes, was absolutely fine throughout the ride. It is that safe and the whole thing rotates very slowly to not cause dizziness or nausea.
One rotation was about 40 min and we got fantastic views of downtown. Of course it helped that the weather was clear when we had gone. The more interesting views (according to me), are those of the downtown. You get to see these views only after half the rotation is complete (because the first half, you'll be facing the opposite side of downtown). Actually this can be ideal time to practice some photo shots with your DSLR and get the settings right. Going at night offers magnificent views of the city. After the journey, you can easily grab a taxi back home. There are multiple restaurants in the arena offering various cuisines. There's also an Indian buffet restaurant, albeit, a bit on the costly side.
Overall definitely recommended.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-28 11:33:02.465566

Rising above the tall buildings, and being able to see far and beyond is a lovely feeling.

It takes close to 40 minutes for the full circle of this giant wheel to complete.

Buying tickets in advance is advisable.
You can see the commercial district, the river, gardens by the bay, the sea, the marina , and everything else.

The ride is comfortable and provides a very good view of the Singapore cityscape. Go early in the week to avoid congestion and aim for twilight. This way your journey begins in daylight and by the time you reach the apex you will see the sunset over Marina Bay. Then Singapore switches on the lights and the view is spectacular.

When we just given our tickets, we had to scan our bags but we had to wait to scan as the queue reached the scanning machine. We did not realise that from the scan area, it was forever to ride on the Flyer. While in line, there were only some images and non-working exhibits. There were no seats - so for elderly and young kids it was too much because the queue was moving very slowly.
Only then I knew that out of 28 capsules, 11 were used for private dining/private whatever activities. That made basically only 17 capsules operating for ""other"" passengers. At that time, there were no private events so the 11 capsules were going around empty. I just see such inefficiency resulting in long and slow queue of passengers looking to ride the Flyer ""normally"". Waiting time at that time was about 1.5 hour. You can't exit anyway.. so hungry or tired, you still had to continue queuing.

Once you ride, the view was spectacular though - given good weather and clear sky.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:34:45.076500

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/PappanMajumdar,448458204,02-01-2017,5,Must do in Singapore and truly worth every buck,"Well, this is not such a hyped place of visit like that of Universal Studios, Garden By The Bay, Clarke Quay, etc. So, frankly, we thought it will be an ordinary experience. But, trust me this was really a very memorable activity for tourists in Singapore. Its half hour of the best views anybody could get from anywhere.

The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. It flaunts an outstanding view of the Singapore Bay area, Singapore Central Business District and its roads and highways, at a height of about 514 feet. You also get to see parts of the famed F1 street track of the Singapore Grand Prix.

It is a definite must for tourists who want to witness Singapore's wonderful scenic beauty. After all, the ride is only for 30 minutes and is a very relaxing way to perk up your evening. I suggest that the most suitable time to go for the ride is exactly 15 minutes before the sun sets in Singapore so that you are able to see how Singapore's day melts into a starry city night. It is not a fast ride despite the towering height it achieves, but really slow and fascinating for all ages. So a great way to spend some quality time with your family.

The capsules are extremely spacious and are surrounded on all ends by clear glass windows, so you can observe all that's around you effortlessly. There is also an option of having a lovely candlelight dinner in the capsule, but we decided not to speculate that particular aspect of the ride.

Overall, it was a short, but pleasant ride, worth every buck spent.

Tips/info/experience:

1. If you want to reach by bus, then you need to get down at the Temasek Avenue, opposite Ritz Carlton. It is a short walk of 200 meters from the bus stop. In my experience, compared to MRT, if you travel by bus in Singapore you have to end up walking lesser.
2. The formula is very simple. Check for sunset time in Singapore on the net. Land up at the flyer half n hour before. Then see the queue and estimate the time in such a manner that you are going to be starting the ride EXACTLY 15 MINUTES before sunset time. When we went sunset was at 7.04 pm. Trust me you will see magic as day changes to night.
3. You get a lovely view of the bay area and the sea with shimmering ships with lights all across the sea. The Singapore Grand Prix track right under the flyer. The Merlion Plaza. The domes of Gardens By The Bay. The Stadium. The Marina Bay mall. The Esplanade Theatres by the bay. Every way you look is breathtaking.
4. My suggestion is book online through the official website of the Singapore flyer. As per my research, I did not get a dependable vibe on other agent sites. Also, please watch out for combo discount packages. When I booked there was a package for 2 adults + 1 child. Though we were 3 adults + 1 child, I booked 2 adults + 1 child in one package + 1 adult separately. This came out to be cheaper.
5. There is a lovely fish pond at the ground level below the flyer. Here you can feed the fishes. Fish food is available through an automated machine next to the pond.
6. We noticed lots of restaurants and a food court with local food options. Disclaimer - we didn't have food there, so cannot comment on quality.
7. Suntec Mall is just around the corner. Just a couple of bus stands away. You could even walk it there. So, if you finish with the flyer by 8 pm you could go to Suntec Mall and have dinner there. Suntec Mall also has the Esplanade MTR connected in case you would like to use the MTR for transportation.
8. The best part is that the organisers take about 10 people per capsule whereas they could take many more keeping in mind the space available. But, this is what is good. The capsule is not crowded and everybody gets lots of chances to see all the views without any botheration from the others. Kudos to the organisers for maintaining this number.

So, to summarise. We were tourists in Singapore for 6 days and visited many tourist spots. The Singapore Flyer was one of our top 3 experiences. Please do make it, but remember the sunset part!",12-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:34:53.758269

I booked the tickets online S$33/adult for standard view as they offers dining, drinking, private capsules etc.
getting there with taxi is easy. There are beautiful koi ponds to walk around, food court and restaurants. Or you can go straight up for boarding.
Our group consist of myself and my teenage son, and parents aged 70 and under. It is quite safe as it moves so ever slowly you don't even notice it as long as you not scared of heights. When you feel bit dizzy, it is better to actually stand up and see the view near the window then sitting down.
Best time to go is at twilight. You get to take photos and see the landscape also when the sun about to set that gives a different light. The one round takes about 30min and is well worth it. Would recommend if you haven't done it.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:35:10.990050

The cars are as big as a bus and in case there aren’t many people waiting you can actually take the ride on your own (just your family for example). There are dinner cars as well with tables inside so that’s another idea how to add a great view to your meal.
Make sure it's not raining while you are up (meaning take the ride in the morning!), otherwise you might not see anything else but the rain :-) Night / sunset ride would also be nice.

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/itspriyanka,440513488,28-11-2016,4,Good touristy activity; though pricey,"We booked the flyer tickets through Klook. Though we were hardly getting any discount, the reason we took it was it gave a particular time slot rather than an open ticket like you get on the flyer's website. We wanted to see the sunset from the flyer which was supposed to happen at 6:50pm. We took the 6:30pm slot at Klook. We have always had good experience with tickets booked through klook; but this was disappointing. Looks like klook has tie-up with the duck tour organizers and we had to get our ticket redeemed there. The lady there asked us to come at 6:30pm and stand in line with almost 30 other people (who had booked through them). Much to our irritation, they counted us 4 times (my 6 yr old would have counted faster!). By the time we entered the line to get into the flyer; it was already 7:15pm. From then on, it was a breeze because the queue was very short.

When we pointed earlier that there was hardly any queue at flyer and if it was possible to move us to 6pm slot; the lady at the reception flatly refused. While I understand this has more to do with Ducktours/ Klook service; It was really really frustrating to miss the sunset from the flyer.

Flyer in itself is a unique experience and the view from the top is nice. We got to see Gardens by the bay lights from the top and the view of the Marina Bay Sands was fantastic too..The flyer moves very slowly and hardly gives and impression of you being in a Ferris wheel. There is nothing to be scared off; even for people who are scared of heights. The entire ride takes around 35 min of time.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:35:39.298446

The hardest decision you have to make is:-

Do you want to see Singapore by daylight, dusk, or dark?

Once you work that out the rest is easy.

Turn up, pay, and make your way up to the boarding area. The Flyer does not stop so the 'pod' keeps moving while it empties and you then board. The 'pod' holds about 20 people but it was reasobably quiet when we went so there were only about 8 or 10 of us in ours. It is air-conditioned.

The glass does have a green tint which seems more noticable in some peoples' daytime photos but not as noticable in the night photos but I'm no expert. I'm happy with my photos.

If it's raining, put it off if you can as obviously you can't see as far.

We went in August 2017 and had taken the viator tickets package so did not have to stand in the ticket queue. Pram Friendly right up to the entrance which is on a higher level. There's a security checkpoint where you need to leave the pram and other big bags. We went during the afternoon and there was a queue at the boarding post so it took us about 30 mins to board the flyer.

There were about 10 of us in a capsule which can accommodate upto 20. Very spacious and air conditioned. The view was excellent and the speed is simply perfect - neither too fast nor too slow. They make an announcement when your capsule is at the peak and you have ample time to take photos and capture the view!

It's the height if 42 storey building and even taller than London Eye. Each ride takes around 30 mins and it is extremely stable and secure so you do not feel nervous or anxious at all.
It was not a busy night when we went and we could get on a passenger car having to wait for just 15 mins. We were a party of three and had to share the lift with three other young girls but that was ok cos the passenger car is spacious enough for the six of us to walk freely around, or to sit there and gaze at the beautiful city. Each of us had enough space to enjoy the magnificent view from 165 m above, we did not feel cramped at all.
We were totally captivated by the stunning scenery of Singapore skyline at night, with its beautiful lights shimmering in the distance. There was no disturbing music playing and that is good , cos we would not be disturbed or distracted by any noise and could fully focus on aesthetic scene after scene that fed our eyes.
We were treated to 360 degrees of unobstructed views of iconic and historic landmarks and all of us were able to capture vivid memorable moments even with our smartphones cos the glass panels were very clean and smudge free.

We booked this in advance on 8/22 & got confirmation. Before our trip to Singapore, our booking was planned for the last time slot ride on 9/4 @ 7:30pm (Sunday) to catch the sunset or evening lights. On 9/1 we received an email that the ride/tour was completely sold out & had to choose another time for that day, next available times lot was 6pm. Not ideal...

Liuda Tours must be the company that gives you your e-voucher, at an office around the corner of the Singapore flyer entrance. My only complaint was that they didnt seem to organized.

We arrived 15 mins early and was told to wait till they called our time, 6pm. Once they did... It was approx 60 other people in this time slot, and we had to form a line outside for them to count how many people were in this group. Given this was an extremely hot & muggy day standing outside with no A/C and in the sun was very uncomfortable.

They must have recounted the line several times, as more later people arrived and joined the line. It was approx 15 mins later before we move to the Singapore flyer entrance. We didnt realize this was a group tour to a ride.

I think it would have been faster if we just purchase the Singapore flyer ticket at the ticket counter, and be on the ride faster...since there was no lines...perhaps the cost of buying at the counter may be a few dollars more...

Overall the ride was nice & great view of the Marina & city, It is approx 30 mins long and each capsule has A/C and comfortable. Glad our capsule was not filled to the max capacity.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:37:44.198874

The scenery is awesome be it in the day or at night.
Personally, I feel that going up on the Flyer around 6-ish (between 18:30-19:00hours, *you might want to check the sunset timing on the internet for more accurate information) in the evening would be the best timing as you get to see both day and night...
Erm, try to get there earlier especially during weekends in case of long queue.
There are also quite a number of shops, eateries around the area. If you want something special, you might want to try their Premium Sky Dining Flight. It's a whole different experience!
The area around Flyer (you can walk to MBS/ Gardens by the bay) is pretty big, so perhaps spend a day there and just enjoy yourself!!! ;)",12-2015,Family,2020-01-28 11:37:44.996557

The only thing i think would he nice to have is a guide to talk breofly about the places and main spots you see from up there ( there are photos hanged with places' names) but would be better to have a guide to tell you where to look to spot the place shown in the pictures.

First of all, the car you travel in is huge, like the size of a small bus or shuttle, with chairs in the middle and a solid floor. You can sit in the middle and not have the feeling of the ground going out from under you. Also, the car does not swivel or swing, so it doesn't feel like you may fall out.

The hop on hop off tour has a stop right at the base. There are a few food and snack options in the building that are quite good.

Plus, before i knew it the ride was over in under 30mins hehe! Photography is always my primary concern when i go to places. So if you are only after taking pics and on a tight budget and would have to choose between this ride and the Sands SkyPark, i would suggest the latter. You can stay for a longer period, enjoy the great view while sipping a cup of coffee.. and most esp. take snapshots of SG's skyline and entrance ticket is a bit cheaper (S$23).. hehe!

HOWEVER, for a (cheaper) and just as spectacular view of Singapore, the Singapore Flyer would be my choice. This is especially true if you're a family (once you're all locked inside the pod, even parents can relax and and enjoy the sights, as there isn't anywhere for people to run off to!). Plus, the view continues to change during the 30min rotation - starting with views of the harbour and Marina Bay, and then ending with views over the city.

For the romantics, also check out the dining option. Two rotations (i.e. one hour) with a sit-down four course meal!

And, after the flight, make your way to ground level to check out the Koi Pond. There are also great on-ground photo opportunities with Marina Bay in the background, or in front of the ""Singapore Flyer"" sign (tip for iPhone users, the panorama feature is handy!).",05-2016,Family,2020-01-28 11:42:30.935790

Upon researching, we decided to time our embarkation nearer to sunset to enjoy the sun setting on the city. Unfortunately, we got up too early to experience the sunset! The view on the way up, on top and down did not disappoint! Gorgeous! There's no point in me describing what you can see up there as the view is well worth the price.

However, getting up was slightly tricky as the Flyer never stops. It moves really really slowly though so everybody is supposed to ""jump"" on when the capsule approaches the platform. Those with mobility issues should bear this in mind. Also, it's a no-no for those with fear of heights as the capsule is pretty much all glass.

The centre is quite nice to walk about while waiting to embark or after. It overlooks the starting grid and paddock area of the Singapore GP. Gardens by the Bay can also be seen from there.

After our trip up, we took a walk along the Helix bridge to Marina Bay Sands. It was a very nice walk! We really enjoyed it!",05-2015,Family,2020-01-28 11:45:02.546126

We boarded and luckily the Chingay parade just started at the Stadium. There were neon dragons and floats parading around with dancers. The first half is facing backwards so it's more of a city view.

First the pros. The idea is creative. There are these horizontal drum like glass enclosed containers hung in a circular mode on a vertical wheel which rotates ever so slowly. So you get to stand with 30 other people who are madly taking aerial pictures of the city from this height. The cost of this ride is almost $100.
For us it as a bit of a come down, because Singapore being a high rise city, one gets aerial views from virtually every building and we were blessed to be on a high floor of a hotel so had these views daily. Yet,we got caught in the frenzy and took a hundred pictures over and over again with the others.
It was an ok experience, not to be done again and can easily be skipped unless one is deprived of aerial views where you live . Then it might be a sight worth seeing.",07-2015,Family,2020-01-28 11:46:01.274456

Ideally we would have hung around and waited for the weather to clear but there is nothing else there or nearby. Ended up getting a taxi back into town for lunch and trying again a few hours later.
When we arrived back we could see the wheel was turning and it was open again.
There were very little queues and our pod has about 12 people in it alogether which was good, not too busy.
This wheel is huge and you get nice views, but really there isn't much you can see that you can't see from a high floor in a hotel....
The weather wasn't great so maybe this restricted our view but I kind of doubt that.
This is probably a must do/one time thing.
I'm glad I done it, but if returning to Singapore I wouldn't feel the need to return here.

+ its a giant ferris wheel
(2nd biggest in the world, only lost by 2.6m)
+ experience of life time, must visit at least once
+ having been during noon and evening, one could strongly suggest the evening view is much better

Cons :
- no MRT direct access (yet)

Traveler Tips :
* a taxi driver suggested that marina sands bay is better, because it doesn't limit how long you stay, and cheaper ticket too.
But personally i would still strongly suggest to try this first.
* for obvious reason, not good for people who are afraid of height",06-2015,Family,2020-01-28 11:46:26.831469

This is where you are put into a special car with a bar and are given Singapore Flings to drink. Non-alcoholic versions are available for underage drinkers. Booking this flight is more expensive than the regular trip but well worth it. There are limited number of people allowed in a car and you are treated like a VIP. You arrive at the complex are are sent to the concierge room and are escorted to your special car. The Singapore Fling is really tasty. We all enjoyed our drinks. The Flyer is set up in a feng shui way. You start out with views of the water which is viewed as prosperous. End with views of the financial district which is the result of the prosperity. You get views of the stadium, Marina Bay, skyscrapers, ships, and Gardens by the Bay. Trip takes around 30-40 mins.

Finally we got to the area where you get into the pods. The queue was nonexistent and after a wait of less than 5 minutes we were into one and commencing our 'flight' above the city. We were accompanied by only two other tourists, so the pod was nice and quiet for us to enjoy the views, which were indeed spectacular.

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Raymond W,683483889,22-06-2019,4,Oh Yeah! Great Scenery.,"The Singapore Flyer is an observation wheel with cabs that hold 20+ occupants. It is a fantastic way to enjoy a bird's eye view of this beautiful city and snap some great photos. Singapore is a city of lights, so the night time ride would probably be great. We used the subway to get to the Flyer from our hotel and the directional signs were easy to follow. The walk from the subway station to the Flyer is a bit long for individuals with mobility issues. This is especially true if the weather is hot and humid, but you can see the wheel immediately upon exiting the subway station. When we arrived at the Flyer boarding station, we walked a moderate distance to the jetway but were told we had to go back downstairs to purchase the tickets and return to the jetway. Ugh! No food or beverages are allowed on the Flyer, which is why the cabs are so clean, so you must discard any snacks or sodas prior to entering the jetway. Since it wasn't busy and we were quite hot, we took our time and we were the only occupants in the cab. It was eerily quiet and a smooth step onto the air conditioned cab. The ride costs about S$30 and lasts about 30 minutes. It's not exciting or thrilling but it provides an excellent view of the city from way up there. I would recommend this attraction for families with children as well as the elderly.

Day or night, I think it’s a must do in Singapore!
It’s a “share ride” so unless you’re in a group of 8 you’ll be sharing your capsule with others who may not respect your personal space, so bear that in mind. But it’s a glass enclosure so there’s plenty of room for everyone to get photos (although some people feel their need for a photo shoot over rules your needs, but that’s people huh!)
It’s a great view over the Marina and surrounding areas with running commentary the whole way. Takes about 30 minutes all up, is air conditioned and has a bench seat, along with a touch screen information point.

The staff in the ticket booth can be a bit surly & unhelpful which is a complete contrast to those supporting you into & out of capsules which is well organised, please keep hold of children when exiting as there is a gap between the edge & the safety barrier.

It is very slow moving & the momentum is lost a little as you go over the top, if you just want fantastic views maybe Marina Sands Hotel Skydeck is more for you as it’s higher at 250M as opposed to 161M on here.

We went early morning, and there was no queue. There didn’t seem to be an MRT nearby, but we were able to get a bus direct there. Although it said the capsules hold 28 people, there were only around half a dozen in ours because it was a quiet time of day.

But here’s the issue. At $34 per adult, it’s comparable with other high rise views around the world. But there’s loads of competition. We preferred the One Altitude rooftop bar, for instance, which offered similar views - and at $35 came with two rounds of cocktails. Even the Marina Bay Sands Hotel bar is cheaper.

And although it’s a shorter building, the terrace on top of the Art Gallery also offers outstanding views.

My recommendation would be when you get in the capsule, go to the right and then sit or stand facing to the right. It may initially feel like you are going backwards. As the car gets to the top and begins to go down, you will be well positioned to see the Garden by the Bay lit up as well as the Marina Bay Sands and the entire Bay.

It's a decent experience with the entire aerial view of Singapore attractions nearby.

Also, go to the Singapore Flyer website and click on “Events & Promotions”. There are some good Chinese New Year discounts at the moment.

The price is very reasonable for the type of attraction, and the experience on the wheel itself is very good, lasting around 30 minutes. We were accompanied by 2 other families in the pod, which totalled around 14 people. I understand capacity is over 20, so it is good to see that they do not pack the pods to capacity.

There are a couple of negatives though, specifically being that you are not quite able to tell how long the queue is, until you reach the end of it. We visited on a Sunday at 11am, and the queue provided around 40 minutes of a wait

You are also forced to have tour photo taken on your way through the queue, and our ‘no thank you’ was promptly ignored by the young female photographer, as she steered us into position and told us how to pose. This was definitely a low point of the attraction.

At 165 metres (541 feet) above the sea the Singapore Flyer gives the rider a wonderful view of the city. It takes around 30 minutes to complete the full rotation of the wheel, enough time to take in all the sights and take as many photos as you please.

Each capsule can take a maximum of 28 passengers in comfort and with plenty of viewing space. And the ride is so smooth you hardly notice that you’re travelling.

We went on a weekday - so no lines or wait for our turn and only one other person in our pod. The views were very nice and I could see how this would be a good activity for families, but we were a little bored after the first 15 minutes (ride is 35 min in total). Part of the issue was that we had just been at Marina Bay Sands which also has amazing views and so we had our fill of city landscape viewing. In comparing the two, I'd recommend the flyer for families and Marina Bay Sands for adults. You can take kids to Marina Bay Sands, but I think they would be more excited by a ferris wheel and the other attractions around the flyer. At the Sands, you can purchase either the option to just go to the viewing area for about $35.00 OR you can pay $20.00 to go to the Cie La Vie restaurant/bar and then your ticket price goes towards a drink or food item of your choice (both reasonably priced).

When we arrived there were announcements being made over the PA saying due to the bad weather it was closed. Oh dear......we decided to hang around where there isn't much more to see for half an hour and then luckily it reopened.
We bought our tickets easily, if a little pricey, and joined a short queue. I think we were very lucky the queue was so short as clearly the place is designed to cope with large volumes.
The capsules are spacious and due to the lack of visitors there were only 6 of us in it. They do hold up to 28, so moving around inside the capsule was easy.
It takes about 30 minutes to do the full 360 degrees and gives you a great view of the city. It's also very smooth when moving so you don't feel the motion and thus don't feel ill.

What we found was that there was no signposting at all from public transport. The expectation seemed to be that you arrive either by tour bus or car.
There is very little else around the Flyer and it seems to be stuck out a bit on its own. So don’t expect to have lots of choice for food and drinks once you get there. Cost for two adults was $S66. When we arrived we initially queued with two bus tours until we were brought forward in the queue. ( Something to watch out for) once we got sorted the queue went quite quickly, about 20 minutes. The ‘flight’ takes 30 minutes in air conditioned cabins. There are seats but everyone stood up and moved around to take pictures. Plenty of space. There are 4 small iPad type screens to give a bit of information on what you are seeing. I would have to say that the views are good and in my opinion if you spend a lot on getting to Singapore and staying in Singapore why wouldn’t you do this? Yes you might get a bit of reflection from the glass, yes it might cloud over a bit, but the experience and memory was good. I would rather spend $S66 on this than an average meal.",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-28 11:53:08.264338

We didn’t make it a priority on our previous trip to Singapore but this time I made sure that we did it. We pre booked a Champagne Flight, giving us a glass of Moet and chocolates, in a specially fitted out car. We happened to share it with 2 others but I guess depending on the time & day, there could be more or you could have it to yourself. We had one rotation, which takes 30 minutes. There is also a dining option with a table & chairs set-up in one of the other cars. This does 2 rotations.

I booked our flight so that we would see the sun set, getting the best of daylight views and night views.

Singapore is stunning and the harbour is one of the words busiest for trans-shipments so there is always something to see. If you are going to the F1 Grand Prix this week, I strongly suggest that you book, even for a ‘normal’ flight.",08-2018,Couples,2020-01-28 11:53:10.130244

It is a giant Ferris wheel, where one can get 360° views of the city and on a clear day, they say, see as far as Malaysia and Indonesia! It is located in Marina Bay and is the largest observation wheel in Asia. The wheel's highest point is 165 metres (541 ft.) above the ground. There are 28 air-conditioned capsules, which take approximately 32 minutes to make a full revolution. The Singapore Flyer is the height of a 42-storey building – that’s some 30 metres taller than the famed London Eye!! Each capsule is capable of holding 28 passengers, or up to five wheelchairs and 15 other visitors when booked in advance for use by disabled guests. Wheelchair ramps and lifts, handicapped toilets, and a dedicated parking lot for the disabled are also provided. Taking a flight on this S$240 million wheel is a ‘one-of-a-kind’ experience one wouldn’t want to miss. However, shortage of time did not allow us to take a ride on this giant wheel, which we thoroughly regretted!
The Singapore Flyer opened in 2008, with its construction having taken about 2½ years. We discovered that on the ground level, one can try out a flight simulator and enjoy a myriad of dining options and attractions. At the base of the wheel, in the central atrium, is Rainforest ‘Discovery’, where one can follow the 5 paths which meander through lush vegetation, complete with waterfalls. The cascading water displays, streams, rocky outcrops and pond fuse together naturally to offer a picturesque landscape for photo taking. The latest attraction at the base of the wheel is ‘Journey of Dreams’, which uses multimedia to highlight Singapore's history and learn about how the Wheel works. One will learn about how the wheel came about and how old Singapore became the modern phenomenon that it is today.",08-2018,Couples,2020-01-28 11:53:17.940170

It can be a bit expensive for a family with a adult ticket at $33 and a child up to 12 or 13 around $26 or so but the ride does last for about 30 minutes, you can also expect to wait at night as the lines are long we had a 40 minute wait but once onboard the views both during the day or night are spectacular so don't forget to have some form of capturing the shots.
We thought we might have also been able to view and get some film of the nightly light show at gardens by the bay and the laser show at marina bay sands, although you can see both from the flyer plan your trip to go to both these places it's only a short bus trip as the distance to film is a bit far.

The entire experience takes about 30 minutes in complete air conditioned comfort.
The views are great and you can easily identify the sites.
When exiting you go through the obligatory gift shop and you are invited to view the photo taken earlier.
The surrounds are lovely with a beautiful rainforest feel, fish and food/drink shops.
I think the Singapore Flyer is worth a visit, even though the experience is the same as many others around the world, I think you need to appreciate the differences between each cities, the views are unique.

So, I had to wait 45 minutes in a very noisy queue... Suddenly, thunderstorm and lightnings appeared and attraction was stopped... I was then invited to come back later on the same day or within next days ! Due to the situation, I left and came back by night the same day. It was less queue and the view was somehow not too bad. But it is not exceptional I should say, I was even a little bit disappointed for the price paid. Better to do it by day, in a beautiful sunny day in order to take nice pictures of the city of Singapore.
I will soon add some photos for you to see what I'm talking about.

You can also have a private meal in the carriage, which is approx $240 - which is quite cheap considering a decent 2 course meal with a drink will cost you approx. $150 in Singapore and the Flyer costs approx $60 for 2 people.

My first activity I wanted to experience and share our special moment was with Singapore Flyer, and that never took place. Two weeks before our trip I received an automated e-mail stating due to technical difficulties the Flyer was not operational. We were given the option to immediately cancel or wait. As this was once in a lifetime trip, I was hopeful and waited. Three days later a second e-mail informing me the Flyer would likely not be operational and they would process a refund. IF YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE, YOU PAY AT TIME OF BOOKING. I have no issue with that to secure special events such as dinner or slings on board. When they cancel, you are informed refunds take 6 to 8 WEEKS. Unacceptable. Airlines refund quicker than this and they are notorious for cancellations.

When we arrived in Singapore we learned more about the technical difficulties from locals. We also were informed management has changed in recent years and more ""technical difficulties"" have occurred where the Flyer is not operational. Two different tour operators told us they have recommended against bookings as this has become more recent with financial issues. Initially I would have thought ""that's just tour operators steering visitors to other things."" Then we visited the Singapore Flyer grounds. It was deserted, on a weekend afternoon less than 10 people we saw around the sprawling area of the Flyer. There has to be some validity if everyone is keeping away, and it's a shame. I always thought of the Flyer as an icon of Singapore. Yes, it's still lit at night and that's beautiful (hence 2 star and not 1). There is no timeline to get the Flyer operational, instead the same message is repeated on technical difficulties. If that's the case, be transparent and don't process refunds in 6 to 8 weeks. If guests are required to pay up front for bookings, finances should be in order to reimburse.

While I cannot remember much from the first visit to compare, I must say that I enjoyed this visit just as much as the previous one.

We went on a Saturday night, and while there was a fair amount of tourists and locals, the queue at the standard ticket booth moved quite fast. The cabin was not too packed as well when we boarded. The ride was 30 minutes long, which means that you have plenty of time to enjoy and take in the sights.

Even though the experience was pretty seamless for us, we did notice that the queue and crowd started to build up when we were leaving the place. I would recommend going for the special packages such as the Singapore Sling flight and champagne flight if you want to have a more personalized check-in process and not having to wait in line.

On a side note, we had a glimpse of the sky dining flight, and we counted about 5-6 tables inside the cabin. It seems like it is not such a private and exclusive experience as it claims.

I have now ridden 9 of the 10 tallest observation wheels in the world, so riding the Singapore Flyer with my fiancee last month when we were in Singapore was a no-brainer!

When you ride so many of these observation wheels around the world, you begin to notice that the experience is virtually identical each time. The only thing that truly differs is the view...and the Singapore Flyer doesn't disappoint in the view it offers! At 541 feet tall, it is (as of November, 2017) the second tallest observation wheel in the world, dwarfed only by 9 feet between it and the World's Tallest Wheel, the High Roller in Las Vegas.

First off, if you're afraid of heights, don't be afraid to ride the Flyer. I have a strong fear of heights (which is funny, because I love riding roller coasters and other tall rides!), yet I experienced no fear during my trip around the Flyer. In our car was another woman who was DEATHLY afraid of heights and she ended up enjoying her ride as well. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete a full rotation, but the wheel moves so slowly that you can barely feel it moving. The cabins (or capsules as they are sometimes called on other wheels) are large, spacious, secure, and offer ample views in all directions, as well as up and down. A ride at sunset offers spectacular views of the waning sunlight as the city powers up its nighttime lighting for a lovely view that is completely different at the end of the ride as it is the beginning. Each cabin is air-conditioned to provide a respite from the sweltering Singapore heat and humidity.

Once you have completed your voyage, you--as always--exit through the gift shop. In the gift shop, you can view the picture they took of you before your flight (in front of a green screen) nicely composited in front of a wide variety of backgrounds. You can buy different packages of these photos. Additionally, there are t-shirts, key chains, refrigerator magnets, shot glasses, and other souvenirs offered for not only the Singapore Flyer, but also the country and city of Singapore.

If you're a tourist visiting Singapore, go do the Flyer if you've never ridden it before. Yeah, it's pricey and a little out of the way, but cabs are reasonable and public transportation is cheap and efficient. If you're staying at the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer is within walking distance across the river.

The location is great and is within easy walking distance of Raffles Place MRT. There are 28 pods mounted on the outside of the wheel so that your outward view is not obstructed by girder work. Each pod can hold up to 28 passengers but there was nowhere near that many in ours. There is seating but nobody sat down for long – there was plenty of room to walk around and being surrounded by glass the views were amazing. There was never a problem finding a place to view and take photographs, so most people spent their time doing exactly that.

Being a night flight, all the buildings, bridges, quays and roads were illuminated, making the views quite breathtaking. The Singapore skyline is a site to behold with all its iconic buildings and structures and the roads looked like huge luminescent snakes weaving through the city.

There was no need to book, and at S$33 per person (approx. £20) it was excellent value. There are other options, such as having a Singapore Sling for an additions S$36 (comparable with Raffles price) and a dining option at S$299 per couple. There were dedicated pods for the diners.

The way the flyer moves is amazing and a lesson in engineering in itself. It moves so smoothly, it literally glides. I generally feel squeamish in Giant Wheels - but this one was too smooth for that.

Supposedly you can see all major tourist attractions of Singapore from it. They have even mentioned on the inside of the cubicle the name of the attraction, you can see from which side. However, I could not see all of the ones mentioned.

On exit, like in all other tourist places in Singapore, the exit is through a souvenir shop. This one has shawl holders-cum-pendants.

And as they say you fly high to see the world. And this was indeed one hell of flying experience.
You would love if you are a couple or a bunch of good taking people.

How to reach : get down at promenade metro and it's just walking.

Tickets : you get the tickets there at the ground floor - 33 SGD per person.

What to take : you can take some juices and packed food items along with you as the ride is a bit lengthy one. And yes don't forget your click'ocameras

It's basically a round ride inside a cylindrical shaped dome which takes you around and shows you the beauty of Singapore from above. You see the MBS, the sea,esplanade,the F1 circuit and lots and lots. The speed is such that you can enjoy each and every pal and capture each one of them in your cameras.

To summarise : it's one of the most beautiful, scenic and serene place/time/fly that we can ever have.

There are several options how to use the Singapore Flyer.
You can either bord it at the normal cabin in form of a standard ride, or you can rent a whole cabin for yourself or even have dinner in one of the cabins with several rounds.
For most visitors the standard ride is sufficient in order to enjoy the view out of one of the cabins.
As the wheel is moving with a slow pace you will have enough time and possibilities to take pictures on the way up, on the highest spot and on the way down.
For anybody with agoraphobia dont worry the cabins are quite big so that everybody should have enough space. In the middle of the cabin there are seats so you can also enjoy the view sitting if nobody is in front of you trying to take a picture.
Visiting the Singapore Flyer is worth in many ways as you can enjoy a great view and as the Singapore Flyer itself is a pretty impressive construction!",10-2016,Couples,2020-01-28 11:59:38.910467

We were ambivalent about the ride but the bus stopped there, we had free entry so up we went. Despite the small print on the travel card from SIA about having a boarding pass as identification, no one had even bothered about it at any other venue but an officious person here said she would. Of course I did not have it but with some mind dredging remembered the flight number. She was unimpressed.

On the first two occasions, we had been fortunate in sharing a passenger pod with small numbers of people who displayed good manners and some consideration for others sharing the pod.
Unfortunately during our most recent ride on the ""Flyer"", we had to share a pod with a family group who displayed no consideration for either another other family group or my wife and myself, who were riding in the same pod. Members of this family group spent the entire 30 minutes of the single rotation speaking loudly and running from one side of the pod to the other, to take photos. They did not care whether they blocked anyone's view by standing directly in front of them nor were they concerned that their loud conversations may have been an annoyance to others. The small children from this family group were allowed to run amok and yell and scream for most of the ride.
It was actually quite a relief when our pod reached the boarding area and we were able to get out!
This is not intended as a criticism of the people who operate the ""Flyer"", simply it is a comment on what we experienced during this particular ride. It is intended as a criticism of people who do not know how to properly conduct themselves in a public place.
The staff at the ""Flyer"" are obviously well trained and supervise the boarding and exiting from the pods in a well organised and responsible manner.

,1,7,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Pradeep A,508666246,04-08-2017,5,A must do in Singapore,"- The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore I went on a Tuesday morning so no queue at all.
- Interesting fact about Singapore Flyer is it has a total height of 541 feet, the Singapore Flyer is the tallest Ferris wheel in the world and you’ll be able to spot landmarks up to 45 kilometers away.
- We had our breakfast and heads towards MRT for this beautiful attraction of Singapore.
- We were so excited for Flyer and the pathway from Promenade MRT is very beautiful.
- It was a approximately 30 minutes rotation.
- We were only four persons inside the huge capsule and it is big enough to accommodate 28 persons.
- From distance me and my wife felt that it is stopped but it was not true actually its rotation is very slow.
- At ground floor there is a very nice food court and a very relaxing rainforest area behind.
- Worth going! Any time of the day is perfect time to take a ride here, visiting such a place is one of the things you will never regret

How to reach by MRT Train:
Take a Circle Line MRT train to Promenade Station and take Exit A after alighting the train. When you are out of the station, you will see a junction on your left. Cross the junction and take on Temasek Avenue. When you come to the next junction, you will see the flyer on your left. It shouldn't take you more than 10 minutes to reach there.

The Singapore Flyer was on my to do list so when I was in the marina area I headed on over to check it out.

I already knew the cost so I wasn't surprised by the $33.00 SGD entry fee. I purchased my ticket and entered. There are displays to look at in the structure as you work your way to the flyer. Once you are at the flyer you wait in line. The flyer moves slowly and doesn't stop, the cars are emptied on the opposite side of the loading platform and you are directed to enter.

The cars are large, holding up to 28 people, there are benches in the center of the car but you will most likely be standing and changing positions to to view the changing scenery.

There is hardly any feeling of motion, the cars are tubular and are fitted into brackets so the cars always ride on the outside of the wheel.

The views are spectacular, you can literally see for miles, the cars and the glass are kept clean so you can take some good photos as long as you avoid reflections.

The whole structure and surrounding area is well maintained.

Once you exit the flyer you can take a cruise on the bay and up the river by purchasing a ticket at the booth at the dock which is close by. If you need to cool down a bit the is a gelato stand named Gelatissimo nearby as well.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-28 12:01:52.762184

The ticketing counter is located at the drop off bay and hence it will take abit of time to find if you walk over from City Hall instead.

The capsule was relatively empty at the time I took the ride, only having to share it with three other people. A tip for travellers would be to time your travel time. Choose a period where there is no one in front and behind you and you might be able to have the capsule to yourself.

The views at 6pm was clear and you could see really far and the queue after that was really long. You won't be able to catch the sunset if you board at 6pm though. You probably have to board half an hour after that in order to catch it which probably explains why the queue was so long after that. Get your tickets early or online if you want to board at the sunset timings so you can avoid the queue.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-28 12:02:31.025331

We also heard it opened a year ago! While waiting in the queue, we also saw a capsule had people dined in it and we were captivated. However, our capsule ride was fantastic because of the panoramic view from an overall height of 165 metres! This trip my husband decided to pre-book a dinner table and we chose the Premium Sky Dining Flight! We had a waiter served us and 3 other couples. Our tables were separate and distant so we still had our space! Our lobster and vegetarian dinner lasted an hour with 2 rotations. We had entree, main, sweet coffee/tea and many photos we took on the way! This time, we saw many in the queue captivated and we felt very Special :-) Now if you're afraid of height, this experience could be good because while you're busy eating and stay seated, you can still look out and enjoy the sky scrappers, the lights and above all the relaxed ambience of the dining experience with a loved one! So like us, treat yourself. Be Special!

There's only one thing I would suggest is if you like to eat your food spicy or hot, you may like to request for some chillie, pepper or even salt when you make your booking.

After dinner we had a free entry to the Journey of Dreams which was another great experience! Overall it was a very pleasant romantic evening!",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-28 12:02:42.564796

At the bottom there is an old stile food court, where you can sample some local delights.

We booked the Singapore Sling cocktail booth which overall we felt provided better value for money, you sign in downstairs then are brought up in a lift to the cocktail lounge before boarding. The view was brilliant and the cocktail was actually really good (much better sling than at Raffles).

My friends already bought tickets for us and we were just about to get in when it dawned on me (had a full day and wasn't paying attention) that this wheel isn't like the usual ferris wheels where you all take turns getting in, get a faster whirlybit, and then grind to a stop getting off. This wheel doesn't stop. It just keeps on moving at snail-pace so you can simply get on and off when the carriage is at the entry level. All between that, you're supposed to enjoy the sights in seated (or standing- yes you can walk around inside if not too crowded) airconditioned comfort - for more than 30 mins. Since our hotel already gave us higher and very good views, I easily convinced our group to use the good money to get beer along the Marina instead. (Good thing there was an obliging group after us.)

We tried the champagne flight option which was worth it. If you are lucky, you might even get the entire capsule to yourself.

Even at the top, some buildings from the Marina still are higher than you, and that is kind of impressive!

Having seen the light show in the harbour a night before we decided to see the light show in the Gardens by the Bay and then take a night flight.

We were not disappointed. Having experienced a number of 'flyers' around the world our experience of this was outstanding. Although we arrived for one of the last flights in the day, there were no queues and our ride was expedited without fuss and well worth the entrance fee.

There were around a dozen others in the capsule with us all of whom like us wanted to get the best view and take photographs. Everyone was polite and respectful and got what they came for ....... a spectacular view of Singapore by night.

It was possible to see the World of Palm, Supertree Grove from yet another vantage point together with the incredible Marina Bay Sands development, bay and impressive cityscape.

the bag contains passports and approximatly 5000 dollars . when gone to police they also took 2 hour to lodge a complaint .and finally that couple missed the programme of cruise which was very bad experience
my main point to inform all world that whenever u go to singapore dont expact any help or anything like that from singapore people because they are very rude and unhelpfull. so if u go to singapore be coutious from the pickpockets and thiefs because if u trap in their racket u will not be helped by the security people and the localites .",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-28 12:06:01.137536

The cabins are cooled and tinted, which makes the 30 min trip pleasant and enjoyable.
If they fix the ticket office on the top floor, near the entrance, so visitors don't have to walk extra 600 m to the ground floor to buy a ticket and back to the second floor to enter the wheel, that will make the complete experience ""top nosh"".

This wasn't overly expensive, and it was well worth doing. One thing to bear in mind is that if some extreme weather is predicted, they will close the ticket booth. This *nearly* stopped us going on the Flyer but luckily the weather risk dissipated just as we were thinking of going elsewhere.

If you like views, maybe you'd like this a lot more than I did. Our photos didn't turn out so well because it was quite hazy from the heat at that time of the day.

That said, you could argue that this wheel provides some of the best views you are ever likely to see from any observation structure. And due to the mechanics of the pods that take you up, these are uninterrupted views.
The pods are very well designed so you can see everywhere. That said, I would recommend going on a week day during the day so you can possibly have a pod to yourself. The late afternoon and nights get a lot busier. I think you get a greater experience during the day being able to see more.

If you took a cab from Marina Square, you'd get out in less than 5 minutes!

We visited the Flyer at night. There wasn't any crowd at all and I felt sorry for the people whose job was to take your picture before you board in the hopes of you buying a photograph as a souvenir per chance after your ride.

The rotation is slow - so if you have the good luck of being stuck in the cabin with a noisy 8 year old who couldn't stop talking and parents who didn't care to stop him but were madly taking photos of him with the Singapore night scene for a backdrop- you are in for one looooong ride!

I read that the Flyer can set you up with dinner in a private cabin - idea for a romantic proposal!

Pedestrian crossings underpasses and bridges make the journey from hotels in the CBD far from direct and the heat makes it tempting to weave your way via the many shopping centres with air conditioning. Then you have to cross under a major highway.

Best bet is to get a cab. They are relatively cheap outside the peak time rush and the walk isn't that scenic after all... You can admire the architecture more easily from the Flyer when you get there without the noise of the traffic.

The flyer is billed as the largest Ferris wheel and it is certainly impressive against the skyline. Early afternoon was quiet with no queue and we didn't feel the need to linger in the dingy exhibits lining the approach. The capsules were only half full so plenty of space to move around and enjoy the view. Strangely the places shown on ribbon posters inside the capsules were not aligned with where that building or landmark might be found but did give you a reminder of what you should be looking for.

Singapore's cityscape is best viewed from above and the Flyer gives ample time to do so. Even the Zeppelin like structure forming the top of the Bay Sands Hotel reveals some of its detail from the Flyer. Well worth the visit and time spent there though be aware that the commentary (limited) could be louder and clearer and the music that accompanies your rotation could be quieter!

Allow time as you can't be sure how long the queue will be and ignore the rather soulless and frankly shabby shopping area at the base of the Flyer. Why spoil an impressive landmark with yet another shopping mall? It all looked quite sad and we were happy to eventually find a way out. Signage could be better!

But if you are like me..that likes excitements and not wasting time. Maybe not, coz you will be trap on the flyers for about 30-40 mins before you can come down. Basically nothing to do when you are on it. just look at the view.

FYI it can be crowded sometimes. and u might not have any space to sit. When i was in it with my partner, there were some kids shouting and running around. so we had to go through that for 40 mins. :(

We went on a Monday, which i believe was a good time as it could get more crowded during weekends. The place was empty around the afternoon time. We went for the standard cabin and got one by ourselves.

What can I say about the views, breathtaking I guess?!

You can see most of the attractions by the bay from the cabin, and the way it spins is so cool, my husband made me notice that the cabin spinned 360 degrees while we were in it.

The cabin was super clean, so photos taken from there were amazing (no dirty glass if you know what i mean).

After leaving the flyer we had a short 10 min walk to the marina bay sands shopping mall.",05-2016,Couples,2020-01-28 12:14:06.711837

The size of the things that carry you up are very spacious, and make you feel very safe.

The speed of them is good as it takes half an hour to do the full circle which is about what you need to see everything.

Price is $S 33 which is OK, but could be a little cheaper, but still not out of the way.

I was a little surprised at the lack of food places as was planning to have some lunch, but nothing really that was suitable.

I would rate the attraction as a 9/10, the food available 6/10 and transportation a 5/10

A tad surprised that no MRT close by.. Maybe that is under way or planned... as everything in Singapore is..",04-2016,Couples,2020-01-28 12:15:48.377074

There were about 10 people in the Pod so we had plenty of room to move and it was air conditioned so we were cool, I have a fear of heights which I seem to be getting over quicker with each visit to Singapore, so I was worried how I would go, this was another reason I wanted to go at night, as I have found it easier.
The View was excellent as we were lucky enough to have had a clear night, the first half of the ride is nice but it really is brilliant as you come over the crest and get an uninterrupted view of Singapore.
I loved the way the Flyer lights up and changes colours of the Pods, and that they move slow enough so you don't feel like your moving, very much like The Eye in London.

My wife and I recently rode the flyer on the first Saturday night of March at about 8:30pm. There was the smallest of queues and we shared our pod with a small group of another 4 passengers.

The best views are experienced at the highest point and when returning back down. as the wheel spins very slowly you're able to increase the time of your camera's exposure enabling you to capture the beautifully lit city below.

No queues, but while the views were good, we were constantly aware of reflections of the flashing lights that illuminate the Flyer. They were intrusive. I have been on this ride several times, and I think you get the best experience during daytime or at dusk, no later.
You have to step on and off the car while it’s moving. The staff are well aware that this can be difficult for the elderly, and gave both of us help. However I don’t think it’s suitable for wheelchairs, as there’s a bit of a step when boarding. But do check with the staff if that’s a problem for you, as there may be a solution.
There are toilets after the pre-ride exhibition (but before the queue, if any) and when you leave the ride, and of course plenty of toilets in the Flyer building. The exhibition is moderately interesting, if you have time to look at it.
The Flyer is hard to reach by bus or MRT,The closest bus stop is Opposite Ritz Carlton on the road to Marina Bay Sands. in any case expect a 5 minute or longer walk. However there is a bus stop immediately outside when you want to leave (it’s the terminus, bus routes only start from it).

I've been a regular and frequent visitor to Singapore over the past 35 years ( business , holidays or stop-overs) and I confess frankly to loving the place .
My partner and I ( a mature couple ) would recommend that the best way to take in the Singapore Flyer is to (A) go well after dark on a weekday , and (B) take the option that includes the Singapore Sling , if possible . Go on , spoil yourselves !
The bird's eye perspective that the Flyer allows during its slow rotation is made very much more striking when one can see the city lit up . It transforms a modern high-tech city into a high-tech fairy land city of lights . And , taking the Singapore Sling option does confer certain benefits . It feels a bit like flying Business Class . One feels pampered : Seated initially in a ''special'' lounge , being then guided with ceremony to the front of the queue for boarding , placed in a ''car'' that isn't packed with many others , and finally served with the drink you paid extra for . Sipping the Sling while wandering freely around the car to take in the 360 degree views available makes for a memorable experience . Enjoy !

Lift booths are often filled over-capacity for seating, so be prepared to stand for the duration of the ride (about 35minutes). If you're weary of heights, you'll be in for a few nervous stares downwards, but it's certainly nothing too nerve-racking.

They offer a special dinner service and the cost is not sit significantly greater, given the cost of a meal, the exclusivity and the service etc. basically your pod will consist of about four tables max so it's fairly limited. I suggest going a little bit before sunset so you get the best of the day and night view.. There will eat one.course per rotation and they take about 30-40mins.

This is an incredible thing to do and a high point (no pun intended) of my trip to Singapore, but here are a few reasons why my trip in the flyer was not “perfect”.
1) I’m frightened of heights, so I wanted to sit on the bench and watch the world go by, but I had to deal with people essentially running from one side to another to take photos.
2) the amount of selfying was ridiculous. I get it, you want people to know you did it...... so tell them, but don’t make the cockpit waggle when I’m stressing already, just so you can have the Marina Bay Sands over your shoulder.
3) whoever farted in there, I hate you.

I was surprised how quiet it was and thought it had closed when I got my ticket at about 8pm but it was very much open. Much like the London Eye but bigger capsules to me. I did find it odd that the commentary was only in English even though I hear so much Mandarin around but the video screens have language options.

The views get better as you slowly move on up of course and the Bay Area stuns in all directions. The complete trip takes 30 minutes and felt long enough and fair for the entry fee. It was cool to zoom down with my camera to the pit lane and see Sky F1 team interview Force India drivers and I also saw Kimi from here too. The whole pit straight all lit up looked wonderful from here. In the the other directions you get perfect views of the Botanical gardens and the domes plus of course the Marina Bay hotel and the business district. Downside for photographs is of course the reflections and the dirty glass. I took so many pictures and might have a handful that are ok. I am guessing it is better for pictures during the day.

Prices is kinda hefty, but worth it.
I went on a weekday in the evening on one of the last spins of the wheel as crowds during the day can be quite massive.

I shared the cabin with only 6 other passengers (all young couples) and the ride was quiet enough to contemplate. In addition to the quiet ride everyone was able to take pictures from each angle as no crowds were in your way. The view at night is just stunning and provably more impressive, for sure more romantic, than during the day.

It gives you a nice view of the city, particularly of the Marina Bay area (including the posh Marina Bay Sands Hotel, the Gardens by the Bay behind it, Merlion Park, and Raffles Place). One complete rotation takes about 30mins.

The ride takes you some 165 meters high. Before getting into one of its capsules (I don't know how many persons it can comfortably accommodate, but certainly less than 20 since it is smaller than the capsules of the London Eye), you'll first be given some background on its story by passing through the multimedia sala called ""Journey of Dreams."" After the ride, you can enjoy shopping in the many retail shops or have dinner in the restaurants in the area. They also have an XD theater and a reflexology and fish spa center.

The ride is on daily from 8:30 AM to 10:00 PM. Ticket for adults is S$33 (roughly US$25). Kids and senior citizens get a special discount.

From the capsule you will have a great view to Singapore and it is a good chance to take great photos. It is 33 dollars and takes around half an hour. Do avoid crowded capsules because as the wheel turns you need to change position to catch what you want. I think you better wait for the next capsule if you are above 12 already, especially if you want to sit. Please note that the wheel never stops, so the capsule is very slowly moving while you entering. Don't panic, but be focused and control children. Enjoy!",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-28 12:23:32.881016

I can recommend both the SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands ($22) and the LeVeL 33 microbrewery & restaurant as good alternatives.

My biggest issue with the Flyer was that the lights create so much reflection in the glass cars that the views are diminished and ruined most of what should have been good nighttime pictures of the city.

There is again quite some distance after ticket purchase to the actual boarding. Once at the boarding point, the assistants are well versed in their task, and safety is paramount. The ride takes approx 30 minutes, and climbs to some 165 metres, giving tremendous views of the surrounding areas including the Harbour, the Financial Business District and all points North through to the East. I didn't think it was cheap, costing nearly $30 on a concession fare. There is the inevitable 'gift shop' on the exit route, with, what I thought, were quite expensive items.

I was there on a Saturday (around 11AM), there were no lines at all. There were at most 150 people. Everything very efficiently organised.
Tip: If you booked a ‘Singapore Stopover’, and want to get in with your free ticket – do not go to the main ticket office, but go just around the corner (it’s not well indicated) – and have your passport, SIA booking print-out available – the plastic card you picked-up at the airport is not enough. They are not very fussy, as long you have one other thing as well.
On the negative side: the only places where one could have lunch or even just an ice-cream, looked dilapidated and surely in need of modernisation.

Once you get to the flyer location either by car, or MRT (its a short 5 minute walk from the nearest station), you just follow the signs and get your ticket. The staff are friendly and the pre flyer show details how the flyer was built, what was there in its place, facts and figures about the wheel which is educational and allows you to grasp the scale of the wheel itself.

Once your on the wheel, its like any other wheel in the world in that is slowly goes around. I think the total flight time was about 30 minutes and the experience in the glass pods is smooth and you hardly notice your going up or coming down. The view is 360 and you can take a look all the way out to sea and watch why the shipping port is one of the busiest in the world, as there's cargo tanker upon tank sailing in / out as far as the eye can see.

When I went about 10am in the morning, there wasn't many people about and I got to have an entire pod to myself, which was lovely. It was also a clear day so I had a complete unobstructed line of sight. The scale of the city was a view to behold. You can also see where the f1 circuit is and get a sense of what it must be like during race day.

I also did this same excursion at night to see what the city looked like during periods of darkness. Whilst you dont get to experience as much in terms of sights, the parts close to the flyer which are lit up do look magical. Areas such as the gardens opposite, and the Sands hotel are eye catching, but If i had to pick between day or night id say do the flyer during the day and just go to the same spot at night but not on the flyer itself.",03-2016,Solo,2020-01-28 12:26:23.911166

It takes around 45 mins and the time passed quickly taking in the 360-degree views.

Boarding the cabin should be a fairly easy task, but there was a large group of people from either India or Bangladesh, possibly Malaysia, that couldn't follow instructions. The ferris wheel doesn't stop, so you have to keep moving to board the cabin. The workers were telling them to board, board, please move forward and get on, but they all wanted to be in the same cabin, and were messing up the boarding process for everyone else.
The cabins hold around 20 people I think. Anyway, they eventually figured out that they had to just get on and their party would be split. The ride takes about 30 minutes. Views were nice, but it was cloudy and rainy the day I went, so it wasn't the best. I can imagine that it would be beautiful on a clear night.

Our queue was Long and at times not moving at all and I soon realised it was because of large groups of corporate guests (people with tags and special arrangements in the cabins such as wine) who were allowed to jump the queue and bypass the normal guests to board the flyer first. I counted a total of 12 large groups who cut the queue and were allowed to board the flyer first the moment they arrive. Thus, our regular queue was moving at a snail’s pace (and along corridors that was stuffy and warm). This is unacceptable. I have taken the flyer numerous times and I have never had to wait 1.5hrs for a flight before.

We were taken to a VIP reception area to book in and then to a lounge before boarding. There is one glass of Moet and some very tasty chocolates included which were enough for the 30-min ‘flight’.

Upon leaving we headed back to the lounge (which we realised was open to the public) for more drinks (at our own cost) and out onto the balcony with a fabulous view towards the Sky Gardens at sunset.

We checked all 3 were there then were ushered onto the flyer. When we went to redeem my ticket at the Skywalk it was a childs ticket (only typed on the back and doesn't stand out).

We booked the last possible flight and were only joined by another couple. What luxury with only 4 persons aboard, sipping a very good Singapore Sling. The flight takes about half an hour, you can see the beautiful city of Singapore with all its lights. Not a cheap flight, but if you like to do something special, this is it.

I remember one time with my mother and another time with my mother in law. But this time, I was a befriender for a Community project titled `Project CARE' accompanying elderlies from the various old aged homes for a day outing at the Singapore Flyer.

We had our sumptuous lunch at Ban Heng Restaurant before we proceeded to the Singapore Flyer. It was a meaningful outing hosting 520 elderlies across the island from the various old aged homes to enjoy rides at the Singapore Flyer.

Thanks to Singapore Flyer who sponsored the rides that would otherwise cost $33/- for an adult. The seniors were gleaming with smiles as they looked out from the capsules appreciating the stunning beautiful panoramic view of the island.

The staff of the Singapore Flyer were very helpful getting chairs for the seniors who were struggling with their quad walking sticks and having to queue their way to the boarding platform.

It was time well spent and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Singapore Flyer for their great corporate gift to our senior citizens. 一人一点心，社会更温馨 A little from all, together it's more!",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-28 12:33:25.500779

We were in Singapore for the first time and only for a day as we were to catch our fight back early morning the following day . We asked around what's the iconic landmark in Singapore and they unanimously said the Singapore flyer , the Buddhist temples , Botanical gardens , etc . Since we couldn't see all of them in such a short period of time , we decided to just see the Singapore flyer . We took an Uber taxi around 7pm from our hotel to the location . We bought our tickets and we didn't have to wait a long time to ride the flyer . Each cabin could a accommodate at least 20 people and the flyer moved ever so gently as it went around the wheel and changed colors at the same time . We were able to see the whole city and took a lot of pictures as we went around slowly . It was an amazing experience !",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-28 12:37:04.143879

Conveniently located in Marina Bay and easily reached by MRT or on foot the views of Singapore are great. We have done the trip by day and at night. The day trip points out many of the landmarks to visit whilst the night gives breathtaking panoramic views of the City skyline and the magnificent Marina Bay. Be careful of the haze so select your day for best weather. Peak times are 6-8pm and its worth the cost but the sky dining service is expensive. We choose a champagne cocktail trip which gave access to the lounge prior to departure. Will do again.,09-2016,Friends,2020-01-28 12:38:43.301974

We purchased our tickets and were allowed to enter before a large tour group, which was good. Didn’t have to wait for long before we entered our capsule for the 30 minute ride. We shared it with another 6 or 8 people. Plenty of room for us all. You hardly know you are moving, it is so gentle.
We were amazed at the views of all parts of Singapore that we could see. The day was cloudy but the visibility was pretty good. Great view below of the F1 track and pit lane.
We could clearly see the soccer stadium all set up for the Pocari Sweat run, that was being run that evening.
I had previously been on the Flyer at dusk so it was good to ride on it during the daytime.

This is another ‘must do’ when in Singapore!",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-28 12:39:29.428671

The Flyer takes you on a half hour journey with great views of the bay area and city/Central Business District. The cabins are clean and spacious and not too many people are crammed in one. When you disembark there are food and shopping outlets around the area for those looking to chill - the place tends to be quieter compared to the rest of town and is a good location for chilling and enjoying the view.,11-2015,Friends,2020-01-28 12:39:36.170264

Keep those cameras handy as you reach the apex of your ride, and for a few minutes you are above all of Singapore with a 360degree view of the entire city, then you slowly ride back down in your 40minute ride. Cost is around $33 dollars, but if flying with Singapore airlines, keep that boarding card handy as it earns you a ten per cent discount on the price.

I got some beautiful panoramic views when we got to the top and saw the grand prix pits and starting line.
There is no map inside the pod so if you are a tourist then you may not know what you are looking at.
I'm not sure it was worth $33 dollars, but then if you had a quiet pod and knew what you were seeing then it may be for you.

One small tip: The herd will push forward to get a seat in the center of the capsule. Let 'em, because the best views come from standing on the outer edges.

I would say that SGD33 is not really that cheap, so if you can, get a package deal (online) that includes Duck Tour and/or Gardens by the Bay. With a discount (due to a combo package deal), I think it makes the experiences a bit “cheaper”.

On 11th February. we boarded Singapore Flayer. Some of our members were reluctant to board because of its rotation to a height of about 164 meters But once we were in, they had the last laugh. Experience of a life time.

The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. Its a just coincidence that we were in the Flayer on 11th February 2016, when we were told that the Flayer carried its first paying passengers on 11 February 2008 but was opened to the public on 1 March 2008 and was officially opened on 15 April.2008.

The Flayer has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers As we were 12 members, we occupied a separate Capsule and enjoyed every minute of our stay inside the capsule. It was fantastic as we could see the entire City of Singapore from all angles and from all directions. We played, we laughted and enjoyed to the maximum extent.

Though the Flayer was moving, we never felt the rotation and we were so immersed in viewing the beautiful buildings and the beach No doubt, Its worth the money

This is much safe even for senior citizens as much care is taken in evolving the flayer and the capsule.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-28 12:41:35.626996

Timing it is very important. If you go on a monday (read as not a public holiday) you have high chances to get a private capsule.

A fear of heights has kept me off these things in the past. However, a helicopter flight over the 12 Apostles 3 years ago cured me of that [well up to a point]

A fabulous taxi driver we had the previous day told us the best thing to do is try and go on the flyer a bit before sunset so you get to see the view in daylight hours, as the sun sets and then complete the ride as all of Singapore's CBD and the Marina and surrounds light up. Glad we took that advice because it is truly magical. The pods on the flyer can hold up to 30 people and are extremely sound when you are in them...no bumps or strange movements of any kind. We had a decent downpour of rain whilst on the flyer which simply added to the spectacle of it all [did make taking pics a bit ordinary once sun set was upon us and after but hey...should be looking with your eyes more than the lens anyway]",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-28 12:42:04.289376
