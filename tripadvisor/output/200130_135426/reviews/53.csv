It is the only reservoir located in the city. Suitable for old and young and even those on wheelchair. Fantastic view of the CBD city skyline with Marina BaySands as the backdrop on one side and the sea view with the big ships on the other side. Other highlights include the 350 metres wide bridge that goes to Marina East and an air-conditioned Sustainable Gallery located on the 2nd floor which is also free entry. Booking to the gallery is advised in case of big crowd, which allows entry of 80 pax on hourly basis in the day, except Tuesday. Also available is a small water playground for kids. Within walking distance to the nearest food centre called 'Satay By the Bay'. The inconvenience is that there is only one bus service 400 which is within 5 mintues walk but not so if taking MRT (as the closest isn't ready - still under construction). Also no drinking vending machines or ATMs around, at least not that I could see. But with no entrance fees that needs to be paid, I can't complain much. Parking is available but this isn't free though.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:19:05.156805

You can either put on those jogging or walking shoes that have been hibernating in your cupboards and set them free. Alternatively, you can bring your bike or pick up one of those public hire bikes and pedal your way around. Two routes to take along the vehicle free pedestrian walkways or cycling path around the Gardens by the Bay or cross the barrage and the path will connect you to East Coast Parkway. The latter can take you a long long long way but unless you intend to do the tour de Singapore, have a end point in mind. I turned around after Fort Road and headed back to the barrage, followed your senses to the Satay by the bay and replace those lost calories without having to feel guilty. Best of all, enjoy the lights of the city skyline, the bay and flora lined along the path. Best to bring your own water along for the route before you start to see mirages. Picturesque, tranquil and relaxing experience.

The photo opportunities from the barrage are excellent for capturing the iconic structures of the Singapore skyline. The Barrage “Centre” on the west side of the reservoir houses an outstanding exhibition dedicated to highlighting the threats of Climate Change, the only negative was that there was almost no one in the exhibition, us and one family group. It is sad to walk from there to “Satay on the Bay” and see the mass of single use plastics being handed out with every order, the Singapore government is not known for being shy when it comes to enforcing behaviours so it is something of a paradox so see how little legislation seems to exist to curb harmful waste products in the State.

A man was flying a kite and a couple of families were picnicking, however it was very hot, even at 6 p.m. so we didn't linger for long.

We asked at the information desk how we could find the bus which would take us to Marina Bay MRT station and the man gestured that the bus stop was ""just out there"". In reality, you have to walk all the way across the parking area and cross a road where you'll find the bus shelter for the public bus. So, don't expect it to be ""just out there"", however if you look in the distance you'll probably see people waiting at the stop so you'll know where to go. We couldn't see any signs pointing the way.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 14:20:55.806989

But this being Singapore (that does most things well), the barrage is also turned into a park of sorts. But it's quite a distance (walking wise) from other places of interest, and as a destination in itself, it is not as great as Singapore's other parks. You can get a nice city view here, and being further away from the city, you do get away from the hustle and bustle here.

The museum on the first floor is excellent - there is a fully working scale model including rainfall when you push the button - and amazingly a grassy park on the roof. The barrage itself is 6 metres wide and travels right across the park. There are a number of viewing points across the bridge and a park on the other side. The views of Singapore are outstanding. All in all it took us around 2 hours but it is well worth the trip as not only do you see the workings of the barrage but there is a video of its history which traces the construction between 2005 and 2008.

This tour is free and booking online is very easy, tours are from 9am -6pm daily except closed on Tuesdays. Tours last anywhere from 45mins – 1 hour.

Each guided tour takes a maximum of 80 visitors. You can just walk in to the information counter and see what’s available but I’d be checking online so you can see the groups with the least amount of people so you can choose wisely. I was lucky enough to be the only one in the tour group for my time slot so it was more of a private tour. Having said that, there were several school groups there but everyone has different times slot for each of the areas so it doesn’t feel too crowded.

My tour guide ‘Chilin’ was very experienced and knowledgeable without getting to the overly boring stage that some tours get to when they overload you with too much information. The tour starts by viewing the reservoir from an upper level. Again, I was lucky to be there on a day that routine maintenance was being carried out on the closest reservoir door so I got to view directly into it. Next was the simulation of how the reservoir works which was very interesting and very well designed. Then it’s on to the Sustainable Singapore Gallery which is mostly interactive so you can go at your own pace. This gallery is about ALL of Singapore’s sustainable plans, not just water. To end off the tour you go to the grassed rooftop with an amazing view of Singapore. This is a public area and is open 24hrs. Also, the Sustainability Gallery is open to the public on weekends so no need for a tour guide.

I would highly recommend this tour to everyone. Children will love the hands on attractions and adults will be pleasantly surprised by this countries innovations and planning.

I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did. Take in the view at the end of your tour or come back and spend some time flying kites, ride a bike up here, have a sunset picnic or enjoy the night time view as well. The choice is yours!!

""Absorb the great view of Singapore-scape""

This review is going to be for both Locals and Foreign Tourists. Read on for recommended route if you are feeling a bit more adventurous and has the time to spare.

For the Tourists, it allows you to take in the scenic cityscape of Singapore, especially that of Marina Bay and the surrounding areas - would definitely recommend you to take a look at my photos (afterall, ""A picture is worth a thousand words"")

For the Local, this place offers and forms part of a great route for a great Family day out or walking/jogging. There are often sights of Families setting up picnics here as well.

There is also a nearby eatery (Satay by the Bay).

Tips/Advice:-

1) Preferred Time of Visiting? A good time to visit will be in the evening; probably 5pm and later when the Sun starts setting. i) It is cooling especially for those who intend to cover the route between Marina Bay Sand/Garden By The Bay South/East/Marina Barrage and possibly Kallang. ii) the Night Lights especially those from the city buildings and Supertree Grove (Garden by the Bay) makes for a more interesting scene.

2) Admission Fee? Free.

3) Location : Depending from where you come by, Bayfront MRT Station or Kallang MRT Station make for great starting point to ultimately reach here but we are also talking about a min ~30 minutes walk from either station as this place is generally not accessible by any means unless you are driving/taking a cab here.

4) Gears : Wear comfortably and decent walking shoes as you are in for quite an exploration. Again, Evening would be recommended time to visit as it is far more cooling/windy.

Conclusion:-

Rating this just 4 Stars, falling short of a ""Must-GO"" due to the general accessibility of this place and I cannot recommended here for anyone who may not have much times to spare.

For you, who has time to spare and is visiting Garden by the Bay however, I urge you to pay this place a visit and makes this part of your overall route.

Do refer to my Photos for visual and thank you for reading.

EXTRA**

As mentioned, both Locals or Tourists may use the following as a recommended route:

1) Alight at Promenade Station (Bayfront MRT Station if you wanted a more direct route)

2) You may follow the route out towards the Singapore Flyer (and include Esplanade if you want to; albeit slightly out of the way) and explore these 2 attractions. The Eatery at Singapore Flyer also offer really nice local/Asian delicacies which you can first stop by for a meal

3) Afterwhich, ascend up Helix Bridge which you will then come to face Marina Bay Sands, which you can choose to explore the interiors including taking a glimpse of the infamous Hotel - there is an elevator here that will lead you all the way up to where you can cross over to the Hotel before exiting to land yourself in the hub of Garden by the Bay (South)

4) You may explore the Garden by the Bay (South) for the Supertree Groves, along with visiting the Flower Dome and Cloud Garden

5) After exiting the Cloud Garden, you may take a route up to where the Satay by Bay where the Marina Barrage is also located, further up.

6) For those intending to explore further (and has the time to), you may cross the Bridge and hop over to Marina By the Bay (East) and follow through with the route to where Kallang Stadium is, to take a glance of the newly built National Stadium. You will also arrive at Kallang MRT station.

7) On an added note, Singapore Flyer, Satay by the Bay and lastly Kallang Stadium form parts of these recommended stops that have abundant choices of eateries.",10-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 14:21:48.797071

It's at a comfortable distance away from the bustling city center and just a stone's throw away from the other big attraction in Singapore: Gardens By The Bay (GBTB)!

As a local, if you are not keen in picnics or flying kites, you will seldom (or rather, never) have a reason to head over here. The nearest MRT station is the Bayfront station (located on the Downtown and Circle lines). If the weather is good, you can take a stroll from Marina Bay Sands -> GBTB -> Marina Barrage. In fact, you will find quite a number of people cycling or jogging along the tracks.

What I will highly recommend is to rent a bicycle from East Coast Park and cycle to Marina Barrage. It might seem far but it really isn't so! But, of course, do check the weather forecast beforehand as the weather can get quite erratic in Singapore.

When you are there at Marina Barrage, you can either have a picnic, take some photos, fly kites, have a photoshoot or even just to chill and enjoy the scenic views.

It was interesting but could have been much better. Good historical focus - the kampong era with its floods and droughts to the fledgling country in the 60's and Lee Kwan Yew's inspiration to do away with the old and in with the new. In all he did - he did with passion - and that included cleaning up the Singapore and Kallang Rivers, then heavily polluted. The birth of reservoirs and the road to Singapore's water self sufficiency. In front of us were a group of Hong Kong secondary or college students so sat in on their presentation. Pleased I did as the mechanical model was fairly useless without an explanation. Moved on to the next room which dealt with reclamation - guide poorly presented the topic. Said reclamation started by pouring soil in and covering it with sea water - living here - I do hope not. Told the students reclamation was common in Singapore as opposed to Hong Kong - not so - they are experts in reclaiming from the sea too. For all her faults - I did learn how the barrage operates and some water management points.

Drove to Marina Barrage area, parked at the car park located at Gardens by The Bay. Enjoyed a relaxing morning walk along the promenade, saw the Singapore skyline. Abundance of dew and cool fresh air. Saw the sun rising from the east. The sky changed its colour slowly before it really brightened up. Many joggers running about. Saw people fishing too. Amazingly saw the otters family swimming to land, relaxing by the bay. They were simply so cute. Saw the dam that separates the sea water and the reservoir. Many vessels in the outer sea. Also drogon boaters cheering and rolling their boat. A place to rejuvenate the tired soul and mind in this buzzing garden city. Totally cooling, peaceful and relaxing.

Enjoyed the morning stroll. Nearest MRT likely to be Bayfront (Marina Bay Sands) and walk across.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 14:23:36.789514
