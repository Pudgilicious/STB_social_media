But Singapore is unique in it's rapid development in just a few decades from what was essentially a colonial backwater to a high-tech global city-state tasked with providing for over 5 million residents on a finite island that struggles with its size.

The City Gallery's exhibits highlight the building and infrastructure challenges faced and how each challenge has been (and continues to be) met, from reclaimed land to transportation to housing to the creation of whole neighborhoods, water resources and management, and the preservation of its historical districts and shop houses. The enormous 3-D scale model of Singapore is worth the prices of admission, but there is so much more. It is a great place to start to learn about how this place came to be what it is and get a feel for the physicality of the city.

As in everything Singapore, the City Museum is well organized, quiet, with good lighting and clean restrooms. You could go through this museum in an hour or you could easily spent 2 or 3, depending on your interest and time constraints.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 14:29:04.074794

There are a variety of benches inside the reception area and are made from the old National Stadium seats. They were apparently part of a local competition and the results are incredibly inventive and quirky, and they aren't even in the exhibition space, they're just dotted around for visitors to enjoy. The water feature in the reception area is wonderful, and apparently catches a few people out, who mistake the expansive marble covered flowing water for a seating area....take a change of clothes!
Inside the gallery, which is free to enter, is a very interesting pictorial history of this beautiful island state and how innovation and sensitive planning have taken this once Colonial outpost from poverty into a vibrant, productive, verdant, modern and pristine country. The huge scaled down cityscape model is amazingly lifelike and fully shows the vast improvements that are being and have been made over recent decades.
