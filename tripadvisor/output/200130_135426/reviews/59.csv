His knowledge and personal experience in Peranakan culture certainly left us wanting more. He welcomed us into his house and showed us his treasures.

We were on a tour with about 13 people and it was very crowded and hard to see things in the upper room of the house. Alvin allowed us to stay longer to view the items after others had left which we appreciated.

The tour was just over an hour long and it cost $120 for my 15 year old son and I (for that price we received a small but delicious hot drink and a Peranakan desert/snack). We have been on 7 walking/bus tours during our stay and they cost around SGD20/hour (Jane's Tours, and The Original Singapore Tours) as well as museum all day entrance +tours which also cost about SGD20 (National Singapore Museum) I would have given Alvin 5 stars and recommended this tour to all my friends had it been closer to SGD30. It's a great tour/museum but very expensive for just an hours visit.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-30 15:59:26.163445

We wanted a place where the children can have a close up experience with all things Peranakan and Alvin did not fail to delivery. This gives the children much more exposure than the museums where they can only see things behind a glass panel.

Even though this is the first time Alvin hosted preschoolers (32 of them!), he managed to engage the children and our learning goals were well met. Thank you Alvin for hosting us and making a mess of your house!",05-2018,Family,2020-01-30 15:59:26.506772

Started at the age of 7, Alvin became passionate about leaning his Peranakan (this unique culture started about 200 years ago when the Chinese men married Malay women) heritage, and he found he could do so by collecting antique pieces. The Peranakan families speak English at home, follow Chinese traditions for holidays, weddings and funerals, but follow Malay culture for food and clothing. The fusion of different cultures created some very interesting antique pieces that combined all 3 cultures. From our conversations with Alvin, you can tell he is very proud of his heritage, and very passionate about preserving it, which displayed in every corner of his house.

Alvin was a very good at communicating among Chinese, English and Japanese speakers, interchange the words in 3 languages fluently. As an excellent story teller, he retold his stories about obtaining some pieces with such fondness that you could tell how much he enjoyed putting this amazing collection together.

Highly recommend this museum! You can learn so much about this unique culture from Alvin and be happy there is a passionate man who is trying all he can to preserve it.",05-2018,Family,2020-01-30 15:59:26.876150

of Alvin Yapp. Through his passion for his culture, collection and stories we learn about the unique Peranakan culture which embodies the hybrid/adaptation of Southeast Asian, East Asian and European characteristics formed over the past 2 centuries. This is a part of Singapore that is both historically and aesthetically significant but not often explored. The museum includes furniture, crockery, jewellery and intricately beaded footwear.

The collection at The Intan was amazing. Alvin was the real MVP here, exhibiting himself almost as if he were one of the items on display. His warmth, charisma and genuinely engaging nature struck us as quintessentially Peranakan.

You are welcomed into the beautifully-furnished living room, and offered a cup of warming tea (a specially chosen blend). Alvin takes some time to get to know each guest and their interests before introducing himself, the house, and his collection. He invites personal questions about his culture as he carefully and meticulously explains intricacies in the melding traditions of his proud heritage.
After a tour of the house, Alvin offers some traditional kueh as a light snack with more tea, over which he lightheartedly answers more of our questions about his amazing collection and his plans for the future.

As a child of mixed heritage myself, having grew up in a nearby neighbourhood, I was fascinated by Alvin's story and his curiosity and perspective. When we met I mentioned that I had recently moved to Sweden and that my mum was excited to visit Abba The Museum in Stockholm.
Before we left, Alvin excitedly sat us down in the living room and played us Abba's Dancing Queen on the piano. It was a lovely gesture, my mum and I were entranced in nostalgia.

Thank you for a wonderful afternoon, Alvin. All the best for the future (:",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:59:35.321047

Found The Intan while searching for such a place. We read all reviews about the place and made our decision to visit. Communicating with Alvin thru email was a breeze. He responded promptly and we confirmed our visit.
On the day of our visit, we arrived an hour early and found The Intan close. We called Alvin and he was kind enough to direct us to a juice place where we could wait. In addition, he cut his lunch date short and welcomed us to his place 30 minutes before our appointment. What can I say?
Alvin was a most gracious host, explaining the history of Peranakan culture and his collection while serving us delicious rice cakes.
I was most impressed with his collection of embroidered and beaded ladies' slippers and those intricately beaded curtain holders! Too bad we couldn't take any pictures.

Despite its tiny space in a shophouse, Alvin managed to make it feel very inviting and cosy. The gorgeous Peranakan pieces are placed strategically on both levels. Check out level 2 with all the lovely beaded sandals, Kebayas and unique wedding bed. One note though, because of the tiny space and many antiques are not in showcases, this is not the best place to bring little kids, out of respect for the owner.

This is a great place to learn about the interesting Peranakan culture from Alvin who has transformed his love for his culture into a very special 'home' museum.

Years ago there was a really popular drama series on local free-to-air TV covering this culture, but as months and years pass the culture dies down.

The Intan seems to be just an ordinary house on the outside, but upon entering you observe how much of a cultural sanctuary it is. Singapore is a multi-religious, multi-racial and multi-cultural society. I have lived in Singapore all my life (22 years), yet there comes an epiphany somewhere through the tour of the place; you'll see that many items in the house are testimony to the point that the Peranakan culture transcends, or is an exemplary form of, the Singaporean culture in certain ways. The cultures of Singapore, like many other countries out there, are merely where different cultures draw the line between each other and (mostly) do not cross the line. Indians in Little India, Chinese in Chinatown. It's hardly true in the 21st century but the fact that these separate towns are where the separate races congregate shows the inherent separation of the different cultural heritages.

The Peranakan are different.
One of my groupmates tried comparing the cases of coexistence of separate cultures between Peranakan and the global scenarios today, to see if we knew why the Peranakans coexisted across separate cultures so well. The host didn't have an answer, but after walking around the house and observing its artifacts, I believe I have an answer.
The Peranakan culture is a synthesis of cultures that is built by marriage and love,
and the cultural cohabitation today, built by merely geographical necessitations upon a general population can therefore not compare to it.",09-2018,Business,2020-01-30 16:02:11.212542

His enthusiasm accompanies the tours, making the experience educational and personally engaging as he related the Nyonya culture of past and present to the relics on display, interspersing it with modern day humor, giving me a good chuckle.
I appreciated how unique and highly personalized the tour was, where he got to know everyone and spoke to them personally unlike the routine mass tours of traditional museums.

Later on we had some delicious traditional snacks and tea while engaged in light conversation as he shared his and his family's experiences living through turbulent and prosperous times in Singapore.

The museum is rather modest in terms of size, and i would recommend visitors travel light as walking space is limited and shoes are left outside. Cameras are welcome but only on the first floor. The tour itself is around 1-2 hours which is just right in my opinion, and plenty of time is given to study the intricate exhibits.

It was nice to see all his personal collection as not every collector are as passionate as him. His stories give us many insights about Peranakan culture and heritage through his perspective.

I suggest you to actively asking him about things that you're curious about since there's no reading signs to explain things like a conventional museum. And your visit will be a better experience if you already have some background or interest in Peranakan culture, so you can get more context about the basic Peranakan culture.

And Alvin the host had so much to share, I actually learnt even more :-) And this is such a wonderful place for phone-cam enthusiasts. You can capture many instangram-able shots of Alvin's collections and house, and go away feeling so satisfied :-) And I guess that's why The Intan is such an enjoyable experience.

Embellishments in their belts, accessories and even their cupboards speak of a lifestyle in an artform. The photos were reminiscent of what I see in the palours of my old home at Carpmael Road - those of my great grand parents.

It is basically a old Peranakan house converted into a private museum with lots of Peranakan collections. The host Alvin is quite friendly and it's also the first time for me to learn the full picture of the development of Peranakan culture in Southeast Asia. To be frank the house and collection don't compare to those Peranakan museums in Malaca or Penang or the governmental one in Singapore downtown but still it's really a lovely place and you can see a lot of you are willing to dig deep.

Alvin offered us some tea and Malay snacks even played a Peranakan music before we left. In general, it's a lovely morning and would recommend. Btw it's very near to the famous black pepper crab restaurant 永诚餐室 so maybe a visit to the museum followed by a crab dinner will be nice.

,1,59,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ErFrSg,371500031,09-05-2016,1,Absolute Rip off!!!!,"We went to the Intan for an event party with 20 friends in December. The price for visit of the house and diner sold as the full Peranakan experience was quite expensive (S$ 180 per person, actually S$225 if you are less than 10 guests) but we had read the amazing reviews on Tripadvisor so my wife and I were quite excited to spend the night there.
Alvyn is a nice host and welcomed us very pleasantly with a small cup of tea, trying hard to remember each of our names as the 20 guests were coming in. The visit of the house was short and not very impressive when you have already been to the Peranakan museum downtown.

During the visit we learnt more about Alvyn's life than about the history of the furnitures or the Peranakan culture.
Alvyn already owns his own company doing industrial stickers like the one you can see on taxis or airplanes and comes back in the evening to be host for his daily guests visiting his house.
His passion is to buy originals and replicas of Peranakan style furnitures and pile them up in his living room and attic.
Because this has a cost he created a simple but successful business model to sponsor his hobby: having tourists or fellow Singaporeans naively looking for authentic local experience to pay an entrance fee at his doorstep.
The experience is unforgettable and we are still talking about it with my friends from time to time. But unfortunately this is only to remember how we had been totally ripped off! Everything is fake, from the twenty-one century furniture replicas to the ""true Peranakan Mom's meal"" which actually is coming direct from a food court Catering. Alvyn's mother who was there actually told us herself that she did not do the cooking but that somehow the food was her recipe. Although as we have been Singaporean residents for many years we realized that we had tasted the exact same recipes at the hawker center in the past without knowing it was Alvyn's mom recipe. How exciting to meet her after all those years...
Sadly we had to ask her if we could have one portion of the food each because we had all paid the 180$ for the diner but she told us that that was it. At this price we expected a reasonable wine glass or at least some beers but there was nothing else but Peranakan tap water and not even feuit juice nor soda. All the tea had been finished long ago during the welcoming phase.
The best of all was when we were politely but firmly escorted to the door at ten O'Clock precisely because ""My friends this is my house and I now have to go to bed... but I have some good address 15min walk from here if you want something to eat or drink"". Personally this is the first time in my life a "" friend "" invites me for diner with too little to eat for everyone, no drinks, kicks me out at 10PM and ask me 180$ with a Peranakan smile!

We actually had a good time because all our friends were there but for the rest...

This place is absolutely to avoid for diner. And for the house visit, I'll advise you to keep with your first idea of going a second time to the Peranakan museum which is free by the way...

No offense Alvyn, it was nice to talk to you but seriously don't make people pay that price for something they could get for 10 or 15 dols at the nearest Food Court... this is called greed or robbery as you prefer.

But maybe THIS is the real Peranakan experience as we learnt from you that Peranakan people are great Businessmen... what a lesson!

I also was bewildered when you wrote all of us to make a comment on Tripadvisor as if you did not realise what was going to come up. So here you are : TERRIBLE

But am I the only one thinking that?

Becos of my background, I felt a deep sense of nostalgia when I visited Baba Alvin Yapp's museum-home.

First, the host Alvin, is downright passionate about Peranakan history and culture. Secondly, that vibrant attitude of his is reflected in his vast collection of Peranakan objects and fixtures and fittings.

- I visited Baba Alvin's home as a guest for a charity event first in Dec 2012; followed by a visit for a museum-house tour. Alvin is extremely knowledgable & detailed about Peranakan culture & history. His knowledge about the specifics of Peranakan artefacts is indepth.

As a Peranakan myself, I can truly vouch that the artefacts on display in Alvin's home: may they be tingkat tiffin carriers, spittoons, kasut manek beaded slippers, the ornate day-bed etc...all the furniture/fixtures are all of a authentic quality.

I felt being immersed in a deep sense of nostalgia when I first entered Alvin's home. It's true that the Peranakan Cina or Baba culture is slowly being eroded in fast-paced Westernised Singapura.

- But thanks to Baba Alvin; this zesty entrepreneur with a passionate heart for his ancestral heritage and culture has managed to upkeep a home-museum that captures the glory of a certain distant past and of which continues to enthrall both foreign and local visitors alike.

-with Baba Alvin's sincerity and warmth, and his mum's superb cooking of delicious Nonya desserts; I can assure you that visitors to the home-museum will enjoy both intimate cultural knowledge and feast their eyes on amazing and intricate Peranakan objects.",04-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 16:06:49.534434

Owner Alvin brought us around his house-museum which is chock full of Peranakan objects, large and small, beautiful and exquisite - altars, furniture, kebayas, beaded shoes, enamel tiffins, spittoons and more!

According to Alvin, a Peranakan object is one which is either made by the Peranakans, or made to suit their tastes which is a curious blend of east meets west. Among other things, we saw altar figures of Chinese, Thai and Indonesian Madonnas, and a silver sireh box which would not have looked out of place as part of an English tea set!

As a Peranakan himself, Alvin also shared his views on Peranakan culture and what it means to be Peranakan. He taught us a little about how to see things through the eyes of a collector-curator. All amidst much laughter!
