We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we’re back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:52.780945

Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:53.102188

#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.

Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren’t even half full.

The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.

The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.

You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.

I’d also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don’t want to fatigued when visiting.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:53.474751

Used the food court before going in which was good value and tasty. The land train around the zoo was great and saw most of the animals. This lasted about 30 minutes. Then walking around the zoo and having time to properly see the animals was great. At times a little freaky when hyenas disappear into the shadows not that far from you. Couldn't get into the creatures show as always fully booked and wasn't wasting 45 minutes queuing for it. We'll worth it.,12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:53.853546

Lots of encounters and close ups with the animals. Amazing dining places and an excellent show called Creatures of the night which is a must watch.

Naively I thought, oh with pre-determined times there must not be a lot of people. Wrong! The queue to the tram was huge. The tour is nice, well put and designed. They do a good job ensuring the animals are visible. There are 2 beginning trails - fishing cat or wallaby. From there you can decide to continue onto other trails or return. The park closed at midnight so we couldn’t do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don’t recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it. I wish the trams stopped more so we could take decent pictures. All in all, ok activity to do with the children but make sure you plan it well.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:54.530657

There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren’t willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don’t think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times. There are still people there from the earlier entrance time.
Great place to see some animals and lots of people queuing.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:39:54.900769

Oh yea, you might be able to see 1 tiger, 1 lion, rhinoceros, and a school of flamingos. That's all!
I would rather pay a visit to the zoo in the opposite during the day time instead in the future, if I visit Singapore again, at least I can see more animals clearly, instead of spotting only few animals in dark.

Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don’t mind following trails and map guides.
The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.
All the animals were out and about.
A few pacing animals which were concerning.
Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.
The disappointment was that the show’s messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!
Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!

Super long queues for taxis at the end of the night. We waited 40 mins for a taxi! If you have grab app or can order a taxi before the last show ends, do it!",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:40:01.758671

We were lucky as we had a bright, calm night and so we saw all the animals. The tram ride was good to get bearings and to see the lions in particular which were beautiful. We saw the Asiatic and African lions and they were active and roaring and feeding. The Fishing Cat Trail was great - amazing just to be walking through a zoo at night. It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat. We didn’t see the shows as we wanted to prioritise seeing the animals as the children were tired. We didn’t have to queue for anything including the tram but maybe that’s because we went on a Monday evening.

First, complement to their excellent customer service, I booked the ticket online for the visit on 27 Oct but due to the downpour on that day their customer service allow me to change the visting date not once but twice.
We finally visited the place on 9 Nov, we booked 8 pm but due to huge crowd we can't even attend the 8.30 show. So we decided to walk the trail first, the fun start when everyone is trying to spot the animal in the dark. Back to the show place an hour later to catch the 9.30pm show, it is very entertaining and at same time educational. After that we move on to the fire show at the entrance, this one is definitely better than 10 years ago, it last for about 10 min. We move on the see the luminal forest, it is amazing, after that we go back to Night Safari again to catch the tram even it is already 11.15 pm but we are glad to do so as now you can easily see many big animals that we was unable to see earlier.

Thank you very much Emmy with your genuine kindness shown to us, you were fantastic and we hope we will again visit the zoo soon.

The night safari was a little underwhelming, I get that it is night time but the animals we a little far from the vehicle and therefore made it particularly difficult to see them.

There is plenty to do around the night safari entrance and the restaurants were full of people waiting their turn to ride the night train around the park. We attended the 7:30 pm session and don’t know if the time made a difference to the animals and there interactions with the tour.

Everyone sits in a tram that drives relatively slowly around the park, with a recording that informs you of what animals are on which side of the tram (there are animals on both sides, though probably the person sitting on the right hand side (when you are seated facing forward) has a better view. You can see the animals, though the lighting is fairly low so it’s not great visibility. The tram stops fairly briefly for people to see, then it moves on. Getting good photos is difficult.

It was a really interesting experience going it at night time. When watching shows I recommend sitting at the back but also at the aisle to make a quick exit for the tram. It was crowded when we went and some tourists can be quite pushy. Overall good experience.

Possible to do the safari on foot but with two tired kids, we waited almost an hour in the queue. Tip: go on the tram first and the night creature show after.
After having seen a few animal shows (birds of prey in Alsace France, China, Manila) I wasn’t impressed. It’s a very simple show but I won’t spoil the surprise.
The actual safari takes about 35 mins, there’s no wow factor. Getting to the zoo from downtown then queuing for so long zapped my energy. However for kids it’s ok. The souvenir shop is totally generic (I already had a few of the items). SG is expensive so the tickets were also expensive. There’s a short fire show that’s impressive just after the entrance.
Hope you will have a better time than we did. Regarding transport we took a grab to east park and it was 30$ vs the transport offered at 50$",09-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:40:28.565688

Staff in the night safari are for the most part grumpy, rude and combative. Could be a result of the kind of tourist they encounter BUT that's no excuse.

It's actually harder to spot animals compared to during the day if you see them at all and because of the lighting it's hards to see them even if you do.

Our son (4yrs) loves animals so we thought this would be a great family experience. We didnt buy tickets in advance which was a mistake, if you do go buy the tickets online, you will save yourself so much time and avoid the chaos.
Our son was excited all the way through the queue until he saw that the tram goes in the dark and he has a complete panic attack, refusing to sit on the tram. The park staff took us off and told us they would put us on the next one once my son had calmed down. But he still wouldn't. But one on the park employees - Damion was amazing, we are so grateful for how he helped us to try and calm down our son, and how he and all the other lovely employees really wanted our family to enjoy this experience.
They arranged for our family to have a private buggy, so our son wasn't overwhelmed by all the people on the tram and got to see all the animals he loves and we got to have a really cool experience! Especially seeing the elephants. They even arranged front row seats at the show, but our son was too tired by this point to cope sitting through a show.
We have so much gratitude for Damion, Femi, and the other staff who went above and beyond normal customer service.

Because of the haze in Malaysia and Singapore schools have been closed at various times over the last few weeks.

I spoke with Wildlife Reserves Singapore whose staff said that due to the exceptional circumstances it was happy for us to change our dates but that we had to do so via our agent Viator. Despite giving Viator the full facts, its staff said no!!!

The lesson from this is that just because Viator is a Trip Adviser Company, it does not prioritize its customers needs. It appears to be interested in nothing other than its booking fees, certainly not customer service!

Then there’s this queue for the tram ride. We didn’t queue for a long time since I’ve read the review and so we arrived there 6.45pm (on Friday).
The tram ride is so so.. I feel like duration is too short, too many deer-like animals (my kids even said “why are we seeing deers again?”) and the tram’s length itself is too long so that the passangers at the rear end couldn’t even see anything!
After the tram ride ended, we went to see the night show.... which was also so so. Nothing impressing, animals appeared less than a minute (like they’re in rush or something). Owls appeared just once.... sorry, but super boring.
And that’s it. For 46SGD, tbh it’s not worth it.

Please go to the zoo instead.","I am aghast at the high ratings that the Night Safari receives. In my view it is a gimmick at best, and a travesty at worst. The first thing to understand is that every spot in the Night Safari experience has been designed as a bottleneck. That means that long queues start at the entrance to get in, in the first place, followed by those to get on to the tram, followed by those to watch the ""show"".

The tram rides are meant to suggest that we're going through a jungle at night. But the trams squeek and people make loud sounds of oohs and aahs. Overall, not bad, but dimly lit animals where we're straining to see them is really not my idea of any meaningful.

The show was stunningly bad - it starts out as some discotheque or teenage award show opening would - with strobe lighting, funky music and such - completely unclear why that needs to be the case. The animals come on stage, do their bit for a few seconds - and scurry away. I suppose Night Safari sells as a major highlight the fact that the owls come in on stands with their keepers down the aisles, i.e. near the audience members, and takes great pride in the python being brought up a the big surprise when we're all made to believe a mongoose is on the loose. Seriously?

I also find somewhat offensive the fact that a (extremely skillfully performed, admittedly) fire-twirling show is a highlight for the loooong winding queue at the entrance. I am sorry, what are you saying? That safaris are a feature in countries of Africa which can be cleverly represented by fire-twirling jugglers and acrobats? Oooh, lets set the mood to imagine if this were a safari in Kenya?! Cultural appropriation and stereotyping, anyone?

Very very serious advice: if you can do so, skip the tram and take the walking trails. Imagine going to a zoo and having to wear blindfolds? Can't? Neither can I, so please just skip Night Safari altogether and go to the zoo in the day.

We love the facility and the drama of the night zoo. It's evolved so much over the years and it's the only attraction I proudly bring my overseas guest to (even those who have gone to S.Africa to see the big 5).
On my last visit in July (8:15pm slot) we were still excited to go however, upon being told to move forward to the 8:15pm (by someone who already validated my ticket) I was shouted at by on of the Q - minders whom I flashed my ticket too. He shouted ""Hello?! What's that?!. I was puzzled and told him this is the e-ticket on my mobile phone. He then said, that's not the ticket. I was puzzled and then realized that while I was walking forward, the tickets had scrolled to the Rain forest Lumnia (It was a package - so the RFL ticket was before the NS ticket and we has 6 tickets in total). I told him, oh of course its the correct ticket, it was checked already and it must have moved.... He then replied curtly, I cannot touch your phone. So I showed it to him again. All this despite being checked to enter the 815pm Q earlier. I know he was making sure but, he could have asked nicely or been trained to identify how a packaged e-ticked was displayed.
The other disappointment aspect was all the staff on ground. At least 80% looked and sounded like they did not want to be there.... This was not the attraction I was used to visiting. Smiling and welcoming on ground staff.. waving at the trams as they pass by, all I saw and heard were glum faces, and shouts at everyone (yes it was very crowded) but, shouting at guest to hurry up and move and fill up the tram seats was uncalled for.... it was noisy and unprofessional. They were obviously untrained and stressed. 80% of them would not be fit to work at a Disney resort! We made our way to the East Lodge only to find vending machines... of poor quality... melted and refroze ice cream filled with ice crystals... no water only soft drinks... Then we walked to see the giraffes near the reservoir just by memory of their location as we missed them during our previous visits and saw everything been boarded up. I asked the staff near the tram stop where were they moved to and to my horror and amusement his response was a simple ""Dead. Dead already"". All in all the animals saved the day of the visit.

An unidentified animal ran across the walking trail and lastly I got hissed at by a fruit bat/flying fox when I wanted to take a pic. (And I'm 32 : ( what fun huh?!) My birthday girl had lots of fun especially her interaction with the keeper at the Wallaby exhibit.She learnt new stuff that day too!

Buy tickets online for sure if you do come otherwise -
Queue for tickets
Queue to get in
Queue for tram
Can quite easily be 20 mins / 30 mins / 45 mins and you haven’t seen a thing! Tram trip is ok, but you don’t see lots and over in about 25 mins. Queue takes longer than ride. You see more from walking the trails for sure. We did both. Entry tickets are staggered starting at 7.15pm / 8.15pm etc, big needs to change. Once you have entry the tram queue can be massive. If it is when you go don’t bother - walk it!
Can get there on MRT / bus from city but allow lots of time. Good 40 mins to park from MRT station and then time trip back to avoid missing last MRT (around 11.30pm / 11.45pm). Taxis can be difficult to get hold of at end as everybody leaves at same time

Although purchased tickets on internet in advance, need to stand in a long queue to collect tickets. Be careful the ticket’s condition. Moreover, one counter staff rejected my ticket collect request although I waited for long time in a queue while aligning another staff’s indication after my consultation with him. Staff quality depends on each staff, but appreciate if the zoo encourage staffs.

There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm.
However, there are express pass as multi language tram ticket by S$10. When we have this pass, we can enter the zoo immediately even though I have later ticket. I recommend this way if you accept this cost.

<After Enter>
Honestly speaking, hard to see animals since they were hiding or lying on the ground and also darkness when I had been walking around the course.
But, I could see while I have been riding the tram.
My experience which I could see white lions was great for me.
We saw a animal shows, and there were cute animals, so we enjoyed.

We have been to Singapore Zoo before Night Safari. Singapore Zoo was soooo nice, thus we expected Night Safari is also so good as well. Unfortunately we were not so satisfied, but the zoo in the dark is rare experience.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/sgsheep,697820841,11-08-2019,5,Tips to make Night Safari a good experience!,"We are regular visitors to the Singapore zoo - and we have in tow a 2.5 years old. We recently braved a visit to the Night Safari the first time (our last time there were when we were both kids - and we have not returned earlier as it is famous for its crowd). All three of us had a great time.

I was surprised myself.

1) *Find a way to get in the priority queue.* WRS members get priority. Elderly and folks with disabilities are also given priority. If you booked certain tours you are also given priority.

2) *Do NOT take the tram. Do the trails first.* You would have waited in LONG lines 2x (ticketing counter, the queue to enter the park even though there is a timing allocated) after you manage to clear the ticket gate. You will see another long line ahead (where 95% of people head to) for the tram. NO do not join that line. Look at your map - walk to the left and right and start the trails.

3) *Nocturnal animals are mostly SMALL animals.* The majority of the interesting exhibits are along the trails. You will never be able to see an owl or a porcupine on a moving tram 50m away from the little guy in a rainforest at night.

4) *Finding the animals is part of the fun.* This is a zoo, not a circus. Don't expect to easily spot all the animals listed on the map. The flying squirrels live on trees in tropical rainforests - finding something on a rainforest tree at night is definitely not easy. The hyena may decide to hide when you are there. Go with the right expectation and mindset - the keepers are around and they helped us find some animals.

5) *There are many interesting animals that are (as far as I can remember) not in the day zoo.* Things like the babirusa, bongo, hyena, tarsier, porcupine, civets, various cats, flying squirrels, cloud leopard - just to name a few.

6) *Do not leave when everyone is leaving.* We did not watch the show at the end of our visit - because we do not want to leave with the show crowd. There are plenty of cabs around and we managed to get one within 10min in line.

We didn't take the tram, we didn't watch the show - but we didn't feel like we missed anything and we loved it.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:41:13.448840

We booked through a Tour service and if you don’t want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows.

We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:41:14.174638

We found the experience to be quite different in reality.

Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.

We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.

Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.

So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.

The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.

When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:41:14.569368

We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.

After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:41:15.293778

The line was so huge that it took us nearly an hour to get on this tram & to our surprise we hardly saw any animals at night. Except for buffaloes, wild pigs & one hyena. So, my suggestion is to skip this tram & walk instead as you can then atleast wait for the animal or look good enough as the tram waits only for a little bit & goes away further so u miss the fun.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:41:32.303291

Nice to see Animals at night but this has a real zoo feeling and money making .. just mobbed with people.

A number of exhibits on the river safari were closed (all the walk through ones) and the giant pandas which were highly advertised were barely visible. We bought tickets to the amazon river cruise which upon arrival at the start of the ride (a one minute walk from the ticket counter) we were informed it would not go ahead due to the incoming storm. It seems pretty clear when selling the tickets a storm was imminent! We were then told we could not get a refund on the boat ride but could get a credit for the gift store. Upon complaining we were allowed to use it towards food. The river safari was largely fish in tanks with a few varieties of alligator and Turtles thrown in. The manatees were enjoyable.

The food timings are Maintained such that all the animals can be visible . The quantity of the animals is not huge . Some countable in small numbers each breed .
We had an iternary of Night Safari after checking out from the Universal Studio .

I would suggest ‘’ This is not at all Must Visit Place’’ Compared to Thailand Zoo this place needs lots of improvement .
You can visit if you have spare time in the evening . Otherwise no need to leave from the Universal Studio early in the evening .
Travel agents have convenient pickup and drop accordingly so they would set this iternary but it’s ok if not visited .
The light show in the beginning and the night life animals show in the last was nice to watch . Full marks to them .
One good thing ... they allow outside food with you .
Tram ride has all the time waiting of 30-40 minutes so keep patience . No need to hurry . All the times mostly same waiting is there .

Good Place for all age groups.
Now when you plan the visit...remember that the place is always over subscribed. Be it tourist season or not.
So ensure that you do not plan this on a weekend including Friday.
Reach the location early if you have just booked the tickets and not a time slot . Its restaurants and surroundings open by 5:30 pm.
Be the early bird and book yourself a a entry in 7:00 pm show. Other shows are equally good....its just that if you go into the later shows...the public transport on your way back would not be available....although taxis are available all time.

In the park..
Make a foot trip first as most people will gather for the tram trail.
Then do the tram trail.
Now there is an exciting Animal show ... i think there are three shows on week ends and 2 on week days....8:30, 9:30 & 10:30 pm. Walking trail will take an hour and tram trail will take 45-50 mins.

We did it with a kid (7 years old). Since it is very hot and humid during day time in Singapore, We first went to River safari. It is covered with AC so it’s not tiring. We completed River safari till 2pm. Panda was very cute and it was the main attraction of river safari.
Then we went to Zoo which is just next door. Don’t forget to purchase Tram ticket. It’s worth every penny you spend. You can take multiple rides. First we took complete tram ride and saw the entire zoo. Then we got down at every stop and explored nearby area. We could also managed to attend 2-3 shows which was really good. By 6pm we saw almost all animals in the zoo and got 1 hour to relaxed/refreshed for night safari.
At 7 pm we went to night safari. Important note here is, don’t rush for tram ride. First enjoy the show in front of the gate and then go to “Creatures of the Night” show. It’s starting at 7.30 but if you go late, you might not get place to sit. After that you can take tram ride. We took tram ride 2-3 times and finished Zoo+River safari+Night Safari by 9.30pm.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:42:08.425223

In the end we just decided to walk because after queuing for an hour to get in we'd have to queue another hour to get on the safari ride. Walking round wasn't great either as most of the animals were scared off by screaming children.

We filled in time at the River Safari until the gates opened & then went & had dinner at the night safari (as all food outlets at the River Safari had closed by the time we finished) while we waited for our allocated time slot.

The tickets are not cheap, but neither is running a zoo, so it is understandable they want to cash in on their popular attractions.

The train ride itself was shorter than our time spent waiting in line to get on. During the ride, you see various animals that apparently don't need any sleep and are not bothered be the light or the sound of the train. But even if the light seems a bit bright, it is still not enough to take good photos from the train (crazy idea, I know). The fact that the train rarely stops doesn't help, either. Throughout the ride, we saw people walking nearby, perhaps on some guided night tour. These are a lot more expensive, but give you an actual opportunity to see something and take pictures, maybe using a tripod.

I can understand that in order to meet demand, they can not make the train rides longer. Letting people hop on/off also wouldn't work since they would just linger at the most popular spots like they do during daytime.

The concept is truly unique. The night safari is next to the Singapore zoo and the tickets are be bought separately as well. WRS runs the Singapore zoo, jurong bird park, river safari and the night safari. U can buy combo tickets for all four or any two/three depending on time available and budget/ interest. We choose the night safari and river safari. The night safari starts at 7.15 , followed by a show at 8.15 till 12 midnight. The Singapore zoo is located away from the main Singapore and takes an hour each way to reach. We stood in line for the 7.15 show at around 6.30 and it was already crowded. The thumbuarkar fire show started at 7.pm( happens at 7,8 and 9 pm except Wednesday and at 10 pm on weekends) but we were unable to enjoy it standing in the queue. The safari is divided in two parts - the creatures of the night show and the English tram ride. We did the creatures of night show first. Had to wait in queues again and did the tram ride later. I suggest u do the tram ride first and go for the show later. There are 4 trails which u can do on foot. The tram is great experience with a commentary on all animals. They also spoke about their wildlife conservation efforts. We definitely learned the lot that day. It is a good idea to buy your tickets online as they are cheaper.

To each his/her own,some people may like the place as well,but just sitting in an open bus and looking at those highly trained animals who are standing there,just for visitors to have a look at them ,was not a very pleasing sight for me but again,it's different for different people.

Also,the first show starts at 7 pm,so reach their an hour early if you don't want to end up in a long queue.

There are a bundle of things to be done as long as you are prepared to stay late and explore on foot. To start with make sure you are there at the entrance at 6:45 for the Fire show - The fire show was amazing and is free to everyone even without a ticket

Now comes the confusing part. You need to buy a ticket for a specific time. Times available are 7:15, 8:15 etc. We purchased the 8:15 ticket thinking that is for the actual safari ride in the tram and planned to spend 7-8 attending the ""Creatures of the night show"". However, they have a ridiculous policy that they wont even allow you to enter until 8:15. After a lot of haggling, they did allow at 7:30, but we lost precious 30 minutes in this process.

Once inside, a tram takes you around the night safari area and you can see the night creatures (some were not to be seen) After the ride, there are night trails to walk around and you need a minimum of 1.5 hours to walk and explore the jungle night life which is very unique and a must do

The other highlight is the Creatures of the night show - there are some really interesting creatures to be seen and the seats are limited, so make sure that you queue before hand to see this 20 minute show.

Plan to spend around 4 hours (7-11pm). There are plenty of travel options back to Singapore and Grab worked very well for us.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:43:26.012128

Lucky for us the weather was warm and perfect as you ride in a open tram.

For a first time night watcher I found the experience exciting and could have touched a deer or two they were that close. My teen also thoroughly enjoyed. We also attended the show afterwards with the animals as we have seen fire shows before. Our ticket included pick up and drop off from our accommodation which was made life easy.

The tram can take a while to get on but the line moves quick and it is a great little guide around the park.

We took our two children, aged 4 and 6, and they enjoyed it a lot. We started the evening with a tram ride and got to see lions, sun bears, tapirs and deers all roaming at night. We then walked the trails (there are 4 of them) and caught the Creatures of the Night show, which was great. The keepers walk through the crowd with some of the animals (like a binturong) but despite repeating that you are not allowed to touch the animals, some people did which was disappointing.
Whilst it was enjoyable, it was also very busy. We went on a Monday night thinking it would be quieter but it was still packed. We bought tickets via Duck Boat Tours as they included return bus tickets - this was a mistake. They give you only around 2.5 hours at the zoo which is no where near enough. Despite running for the bus we missed it and had to get a taxi back to our hotel. Save yourself the trouble and organise your own transport; there are plenty of options.

The park itself is out of Singapore proper, but a Grabcar was only $18 to get there from downtown and a taxi back was about $25. $48 for park entrance seemed high. The park reminded me a little of a Disney park - very crowded, bad overpriced food and a bit hokey. It just seemed more like an amusement park than a wildlife or nature park. Included with admission was the Creatures of the Night Show. Lame. A good portion of the audience left half way through. I think there were 5 creatures that they managed to stretch out for what seemed like an hour. Simply overplayed, not particularly informative. The “audience interaction” was painful. Also included was a tram ride through the park. Again, my beef is that many of the animals are the same as you would see during the daytime. The problem is that , obviously it is dark, and many were out of site despite the also-painful canned narration that would describe them whether they were there or not. Most of the enclosures were lighted, so if you could see them, it was the same as viewing them in the daytime just a bit harder to make out. They were not active. You can also walk through the park which at least gives you adequate time at each enclosure, but again, nothing I would say that was extraordinary or noteworthy. At least there were not a lot of biting bugs. If you’ve never been to a zoo, or had little experience with nature parks, maybe this would be interesting for you. If you frequent such places, don’t bother adding this to your list.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:10.286437

Arriving at 7PM and long queues a head of us. We decided to watch the night-show first but we were informed 19.15 show was full.... come back for the 20.30 show was the message. We queued up for the tram ride for some 20-30 minutes, got on the ride and enjoyed it very much.
Very much worth the effort and we could even see most of the animals, great experience. What was less great was that when we returned to “station” some 8.10 PM we were told the 20.30 show was already full and we were asked to return 21.30! Really annoying to have ticket for 19.15 and still no guarantee to get into the show. Bad organised and planned by night safari!!!
There are also 5(?) different walks where you can see the animals by foot. This is a well worth to do. We did some of the walks and then we returned home to put our son to bed and therefore we missed the show and I cannot comment what it was about. Night Safari is great but the poorly organised and lack of information of how it works gave a bitter taste to us and our 4 year old.
Hint of advice, try to avoid the weekend as that is even more crowded.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:10.628188

The zoo houses a variety of animals and beautifully maintained...
The boat ride is beautiful..

And the Amazon rain forest section is an unique experience... Must see...
The best part is the night safari... Starting after dark, tourists are taken in a tram all around the zoo with a commentary going on... One can get to see all the animals in the night time...

One can even take a walking trail in the zoo and get up close to the animal enclosures- bats, leopards etc... You can even see them being fed...

We booked our tickets for the night safari for 7.15 as they opened - due to traffic queues we arrived at 7.45. The queues for the tram ride were massive, so we set off walking around the rest of the zoo. It was dusk but amazing. The lighting is very cleverly done and we saw animals that are nocturnal and that we have never seen out before in other zoos. It was simply amazing and as most people were queuing for the tram ride we had front row views of all of the animals.

We did then go on the tram - it goes through areas of the zoo that you cannot walk around so you see other animals.

SO SO worth it and thoroughly enjoyed by both of us. We sprayed ourselves with insect repellent and survived our nearly four hour visit with no bites!",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:12.620253

It lasted around 40min (so did the queue for it, however it did move very quickly, they are soooo efficient!) we then embarked on the walk...which was OK but the boys wanted to see the lion fern and tiger feed and we really struggled to follow the signs as they weren’t very well sign posted and not many rangers on site to ask for directions :( so we ended up missing both so boys were disappointed.
We didn’t try the food there because we were rushing to get to the transport back to city as it is about an hour away.

Split queue of people who wants to take train vs people who wants to walk first.
Make pavement more reflective to light to ensure where we put our steps at all time to avood injuries. Put light at the pavement height instead of street type of lighting which create a lighting pollution and reduce night type of night safari experience.
Hand out brochures or inform people to keep their voice down and avoid shouting while visiting. Also explain to them in Singapore we walk on the left side instead of the right side.
Add signs like coloured lines of the section on the pavement to indicate direction and next station to visit. May be developed an Apps/QR code where people people can get and read information about animal ststion or zoo history and add/share pictures to it to zoo websites, social media.
Display QR codes related to each animal station in the train and encourage to use headphones to reduce noise pollution and handle devices to listen which let people to decide if they want to listen or enjoy quiet visit.

The night safari is a must do while you are in Singapore - there are a couple of ways to get there as it's not close to the city a) taxi b) HOP on Hop off bus has a route that heads to and from the zoo (but the times are limited)

We got a taxi from the CBD and the trip took about 30 minutes.

There are a few activities on offer on the night: 1. firedance show 2. meet some of the animals show 3. night safari ride 4. walking around the zoo on foot

We experienced all of them and our favourite was the night safari ride itself - there is a guide who commentates along the way as it is dark and the animals can be hard to see - obviously it's random luck if you see all the animals.

Walking around it was hot and humid and we left this as our last activity. There were a few queues at each activity but didn't have to wait for too long - but people seem to know to go from the performance straight to the bus line for the safari.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:29.377605

I especially love the animal show. Your animals, MC and zookeepers were hilarious and fun and kept us in suspense and laughter with their theatrics. I loved the open range. It was an experience seeing some of these animals close up and realise how big and curious they really were. And the hyenas, though scary, were fascinating. Brought the Lion King to life for me. It was unreal! I feel the need to have a special mention about the lions as well. I usually try to visit the Zoo at least once a year. However, this was my first visit to the Night Safari. Despite this, it is actually the first time that i've seen how majestic the male lion looked. Usually at the Zoo, the lionesses are in full view and seem to be more majestic than the male lion. Maybe cuz they were always sleeping? Haha, anyways, this was the first time that i actually witnessed a male lion sitting up at full attention and looking all majestic like in the documentaries that i watch. :-) Lovely! And the fake buffalo in their den is an excellent attempt to be as true to their natural ways as possible. It was an interesting and wonderful feature. Thank you.I visited with my family consisting of 4 adults and 3 senior citizens (i can only select the category below as Family with teens as there are no other choices), hence though we could not walk much, we enjoyed the tram ride.

This review covers the Night Safari only.

The night safari opens at 7:15 pm each evening and is open till midnight. It offers the visitor the choice of a tram ride through the park or a walk through the park. Be aware that you need to book your tram ride time slot in advance.

The tram ride is a good opening gambit as the ride quietly guides you past each of the enclosures with a slowdown or a stop at each to get a look at the animals, with the driver giving a running commentary about the animals, their behaviour and their habitat. There is dim lighting available at each location to enable you to see the animals but photography is pretty much a lost cause and flash photography is completely forbidden. That said there is always some dipstick who will attempt to “sneak” a flash photo in.

The tram ride does allow you to alight at a couple of intermediate stops to get a closer look at the animal enclosures adjacent to the tram stop. You can then try to join the next available tram or walk back.

The walk through the night safari takes you through distinct zones and allows you to see exhibits and enclosures you cannot see from the tram as well as take a closer look at the enclosures you can see from the tram. The Lion feeding is particularly good to watch.

The main tram station also has a wide selection of food and beverage options and as with the main zoo, the local cuisine is excellent.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:37.211169

Went on Sunday night. Used a Grab car from Chinatown for about $20. Booked tickets via Klook app. 7.15pm booked out. Went at 8.15pm.

Very crowded. My recommendation is to do a self-guided walk or watch a show first. Avoid the massive queue for the tram which we did first. Took about 1 hour waiting, so after the tram tour, our young kids were very tired, the shows were pretty much finished and we just got to stroll around a bit.

By 10pm the queue to the tram is very short.

It is very dark. You'll struggle with a smartphone to take any good pictures. Forget about it from the tram which is moving and rarely stops completely. You'll need an SLR, fast lens and a tripod as you walk around.

A long queue at 10.30pm for taxis. We made a poor choice and took the shuttle bus to the MRT station Khatib (last one leaves at 10.40pm). The trip to nearest MRT station is actually about 20 minutes by this bus, and we did not make it back to the city until 11.50pm. Suffice it to say kids exhausted. Should have just used taxi.

Definitely get absolute earliest tickets (7.15pm) if you have young kids and make tram trip last thing you do (after 9.30pm).",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:46.113829

The 2 male lions in particular were absolutely breath taking. They were sat perched over their estate watching the world go by and were just stunning.The only criticism we have is that with it being a night event, it's difficult for the zoo to ensure you see everything, so there were a few displays that looked empty.

Not only is it a little out of the way to get there from the city center but since you are going at night you also have to deal with rush-hour traffic on weeknights. The Night Safari tram ride itself lasted only 25-30 minutes and you only see a few animals, nothing extraordinary, it's also fairly dark so it's hard to see much. I was hoping after the tram ride you would have to opportunity to see other animals like at the zoo but unfortunately, there's nothing else to do there besides eat at the food court or catch a small show with performers twirling fire torches.

Even our Grab driver chuckled and queried why we were still going. I was expecting it to be a dud and had prepared myself to watch our AUD180 go (literally) down the drain. It actually turned out to be an amazing night.

We bought tickets online to avoid the queues and arrived just before 8.15pm. The lines for the tram was massive. We were also devastated to find that the Creatures of the Night Show was cancelled due to the downpour. But we were determined to make the most of it and we put on our ponchos and headed out to do the trails. We had read other reviews which suggested to come back later to the trams as the lines will be better later in the night.

My kids were exhausted but we had a good time. There were some exhibits we couldnt see (or couldnt find the animals) as a result of the rain but we did see a few good ones. We waited around for the lion, bear and hyena feeding times. It was great and the guide was very enthusiastic and informative. By then the rain had slowed down and to our delight we found out that the Creatures of the NIght show MAY be on as long as the rain stayed away.

We watched the show. For adults - it was ok but it was amazing for the kids. We then caught one of the last trams around the park and it was actually a really pleasant surprise! We saw a lot more animals (up close) in the other parts of the zoo we didn't have access to through the trails. It ended up being a lovely night for us and the rain actually meant there were less mozzies.

Great experience for kids (and adults) so highly recommend it. Don't be put off by bad weather. Bring a raincoat and play it by the ear. Definitely do the trails first and show and then the tram last.

You can't force these animals to pose for pictures so you will just need some luck. The tram takes about 20 minutes. Afterwards you can go on 4 hiking trails which all together will take you about an hour and a half and will take you again past the same animals which you already saw with the tram plus a couple of extra animals they throw in.

This recent trip was on a weekend (because the shows are only on weekends) and during the December peak holiday period. The creature of the night show was full and entry closed 45 minutes before show times for the 2 consecutive shows I tried to get into. The queues for the tram rides were half an hour long wait. I only did the walking trail (not complete because I had to track back to try to get into the show) and then went home. I managed to watched the fire performance because I got there early for dinner. But then again you don’t have to pay for entry to watch the fire performance since it’s outside the entrance. Why doesn’t the management include weekday performances on peak periods to thin out the crowds? Does it make sense to queue more 1 hour for a 25 min show? The whole experience felt like a mad jostle with crowds. Very disappointing. I probably won’t recommend visitors to visit the Night Safari again for fear of them having as bad an experience as I had. The queues for our timed entries started one hour before entry time. Is this logical? The park has 7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm & 10.15pm entry times. You spend 30min-1hr in the queue for entry. Then you spend 1 hour in the queue for the creature of the night shows which are at 7.15pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm & 10.30pm. The park closes at 12 midnight. So if you are lucky enough to secure the 7.15pm tickets you need to do a mad dash to get into the first creatures of the night show before it fills up. If you are unlucky and can’t get to enter you have to dash back to join the queue of people taking the tram. If you heed the park rangers advice to take the walking trail first you will end up even worse because the 2nd entry would have entered by then and you would be stuck either again at the Long tram queue or waiting for the 8.30pm or worse 9.30pm show.

It was a must see attraction for many years but I think the formula is a little tired now. Don't get me wrong, it is a very slick operation and everything runs like clockwork. There are still large crowds every evening and paying for express tram ride is recommended unless you have a lot of time on your hand.
I suppose my review is based on the fact that this is my second visit and I come to realise there are limits to what you can do with animal displays in the dark. Most of the time they are just standing there not doing much while you ride past enclosures on the tram. You can do walking trails after the tram ride but it is only marginally better. There are a couple of shows but seatings are limited. So if you have never been to a zoo after dark and want to experience that then this is as painless as it gets but value for money will vary widely depending on your interests and expectations.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:45:50.261517

People did not know personal space distance and kept bumping into other visitors. Once the door to the show was opened people ran into the out door theater. Unorganized! After being seated staff members tried to cram more people into the theater like sardines in a can (this part of the Safari Show, was not a good experience).The show turned out to be interesting and good (with a good commentator, she knew her animals well) but the prior unorganized way of entering and cramming of visitors into the theater will be an experience which i do not want to encounter again.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:45:58.230582

The cost is $47. Buy your ticket there. There are 4 entry times: 7:15, 8:15, 9:15 and 10:15. We entered at 9:15. It took under 2 hours to walk around then 40 minutes on the tram. Don’t line up for the tram when you first go in as the queues are long. We went after we walked and there was no queue.

Highly disappointed and waste of our time. Where do I begin with this tour….. Family of 8 visited with 2 small children ages 4 and 7 yo.

First of all, zoo is a ways outside city limits of Singapore and no direct MRT/Metro to get there. It will take an hour or longer if traveling by MRT. One could take a direct taxi/grab there but more expensive but don't waste your time on this one.

Arrived on a Tuesday which we thought was an off day but during Holidays. There were masses and masses of people. Very crowded. We arrived and got tickets to the night safari and had dinner. Dinner was very crowded with multiple restaurants but food was ok. Expensive. From the start a tourist trap with selling of toys, stuffed animals.

Our tour/tram started at 7:45 pm but had a animal show prior with long lines of people waiting to get in. There was absolutely no crowd control from the management and people were pushing-shoving their way in for seats. I have never experienced anything like this. Felt like a mob……. finally got seated outside and the show was 30 minutes. I have to say one of the worst animal shows I've ever seen. Had a few animals come out but nothing spectacular. One of the acts they couldn't get the animal to do what they wanted. It was in my opinion a waste of time. We then got up along with more pushing and people trying to get in line for the night safari. We got in line for a 30 minute ride that had to be the most disappointing. Many of the animals were not in view. Some comments were made if this was real or a hologram such as in the Tiger exhibit. I left the safari thinking what a waste of time and money!

Please take my advice and avoid this tourist trap, not worth your time!!",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:45:59.634867

Firstly, please don’t waste you time going to the “Creatures of the Night” show, it really isn’t worth it. You catch a glimpse of a few animals that are so far away you can barely see them. The owl didn’t want to fly and a couple of the animals wouldn’t come out at all.

The queue for the tram is the most disorganised chaos I’ve ever experienced. Super busy and people that work there just shouting at everyone to try and herd them into the right place. When we finally got going the tour was very disappointing, as you can’t see a lot because the light is so dim.

All in all, I wish I hadn’t bothered. Lovely idea but doesn’t really work in practice. We had been to the “day” zoo before thisand if you want to see actual animals I’d suggest you do that rather than the night safari.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:46:09.130693

Carriage ride to the Safari had speakers which made of the noises and one longs for them to shut it off in order to notice real noises made by the animals which are visible.

It's too dark to notice almost anything. Thus, plan a visit in the morning for the zoo and actually see all the animals instead of just hearing that there are USUALLY TIGERS AND BEARS AROUND HERE, which one ""MIGHT"" come across (but never do).

The creatures of the night show was good and the anchors were funny. Well presented show, but that's all there is to night Safari.

Repeating my suggestion, visit the zoo in morning instead.

The open air enclosures in particular were note worthy for just how close the animals wandered towards you and the tram. This attraction seems very dependent on the attitude of the creatures per the night you visit. So keep expectations in check. And despite numerous warnings about flash photography guests still took flash photos of the critters potentially sending them into a panic.
Whilst it is no fault of the park it certainly detracted overall from the experience. Cameras might need to be removed from guests altogether if they cannot control themselves.

The tram takes you around the park, with commentary on all the animals - we did see quite a few animals but since the tram did not stop and it was dark, we could hardly get good pictures. Don't bother clicking pictures of animals while you are on the tram. After you disembark, do witness the creatures of the night show - which is presented beautifully.
We went walking along the trails after the show, and managed to see quite a few more animals up close. The trails should not be missed even if you are tired for they give you the actual feel of being on a night safari.
Be sure to carry water and mosquito repellant. Do not talk aloud or the animals shy away.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:46:35.062634

There is a taxi stand which you can also catch a taxi back to your hotel.

My family and me had visited it during the previous trip to Singapore 12 years ago, and believe me, it hasn't changed - the tram ride, the show, everything.

However, it is not the best of attractions of Singapore. It may be called thus, a bit overrated.

For one, the queuing. In spite of having booked with a travel agent who told us that the queue is a priority one, it took quite a time to be onboard a tram. The show that succeeds the tram ride is not that attractive.

Nevertheless, seeing the wildlife is a nice experience and enjoyable too. Otherwise, the attraction is not like a must see one of Singapore. Other attractions of Wildlife Reserves Singapore like the Jurong Bird Park are much better.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:46:52.322427

- leopard show

Yes there are 'bad' reviews about not seeing the animals move, or the animals hiding etc, but what do you expect them to do.....dance and sing a song for everyone who walks by? I am all for animal welfare and believe they are looked after at the zoo, but they are in a closed habitat, what would you do if you were confined to your room for the rest of your life? I am sure you would have a favourite spot to sit. Anyway, enough ranting.

It is great to be able to walk at night, much cooler and pleasant, plus you get to see some really amazing animals. Our favourite was the Tigers and the pangolin.

We actually went there twice as my 4yo couldn't stop talking about it.

Plenty of taxis around at closing time so easy to get back to the hotel, not sure if the shuttle to the MRT still runs that late but the public buses do if you prefer.

Some tips:
1. Buy your tickets before hand online and save a few dollars;
2. Don't queue up for the trams straight away, everyone does and you might be waiting 30-45 minutes, study the map and go for a walk along the trails first;
3. Take your own water bottles, there are re-filling stations;
4. Get to the wildlife show early as it can become full fast;
5. The tram is the only way to see some of the animals like the Bengal tiger and elephants and hippos;
6. If you have young kids maybe take a pram or stroller, there can be lots of uphill walking, you can hire them but only if your kids are less than 3yo;
7. The park is open until midnight, make sure the kids are well rested beforehand;
8. There are fire dancers at the ticketing area, can't remember what time, maybe 10pm, ask one of the staff if you want to see this;
9. Bring umbrellas if it rains, there is not much cover.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:47:10.953057

The safari is well managed. There was long queue when we reached but they were well managed and we got our turn in 30 mins. The dafari was nice with commentary. It will also depend on the weather. When we visited the weather was relatively cool whichmade overall experience even better. Good to see those animals during night.
There was also a stunt show with some performers doing some dance and stunt with fireballs. It was nice
The animal show was average. Nothing great about it.
Overall i rate this as good. But moat other attra ctions in Singapore i.e. flyer, sentosa, gardens by the bay are much better.

My wife got chosen to hold to a 10 foot python on the stage - along with experts obviously ;) The past of tram is fairly ok for one to see everything.Too costly photographs like the other sister parks - who pays 35$ for a pic in a frame !Think of reducing prices to normal levels and you can still make very decent money and people will definitely go back home more happy and content.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/TraavelGeek,629815564,31-10-2018,5,One of the BEST things to do in Singapore...NEVER MISS,"It was my second time and I felt like I have never seen this before. Let me tell you one thing in case you are not much familiar with the wildlife. Majority of the animals are awake and active during the night and sleep during the day time. The best time to see the animals in their natural habitat is during the night.
Night safari is the best way to experience these animals in their natural habitat with utmost safety standards maintained by Singapore Zoo. You will have to never worry about them attacking you including the cat family. Some of the cat family animals are behind the glass like Leopard, etc.

I am an avid wildlife explorer and have traveled across the globe. Here are my recommendations for having the BEST experience during night safari.
(1) DO NOT visit during the weekends
(2) Go as LATE as possible. The last tram stops at 11.15 pm so plan to take 10.15 pm tram. Do check the changes in schedule though.
This way you will have less number of people in the park and especially less children. Children make lot of noise and scare the animals away. Lesser the people better is the animal viewing experience.
(3) Take the Tram ride first and complete it. Then DO NOT MISS out to go by the Trails.
You should be ready to walk around 3 Kms (about 2 miles). Wear good walking/running shoes for comfort and they make almost no sound. Try to keep a sizeable distance from the group ahead of you and behind you. Lesser the noise better is the animal viewing experience. Be calm and quiet within your group. COVER the ENTIRE Trail, do not miss anything. There is a lot to explore than what you see during the Tram ride.
The Park remains open till 12 mid night so you will have ample time. Don't worry and do not rush.
(4) NEVER EVER tease the animals or take flash photographs. DO NOT venture away from the designated trails.
(5) Last but not the least...enjoy the nature rather than concentrating on taking pictures and selfies. You will see some of the rarest breeds (very much active) in a very close proximity for unlimited amount of time.

This is an opportunity of lifetime so make sure you enjoy it thoroughly. Many travelers do not know that there are walking trails within the park. Walking trail is the best ever experience you can have than a Tram ride.

I hope you have a wonderful time there. If you follow my guidelines above you will see something you would have never expected for. So do not forget to thank me :)",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:47:19.527440

For most of the animals you walk along well signposted, fenced-in paths through the woodland from enclosure to enclosure. The lighting is enough to see the animals but very subtle so it feels like very bright moonlight. The animals are active as it is cooler and a natural time of the day for them to be moving around. It is also possible to ride the “train” around the safari with useful commentary on the animals you pass.

We find that we need to focus hard to see the animals in the dark and feels kids too young will not enjoy that. The park spreads with walks. A word of caution, the walks has certain stops with roof cover, but mind you the pillar of the roof is exactly at the walkway. As the entire walk is the dark, one child in our group actually walk right into the pillar and hurt his nose badly. So be mind of that.

Tickets, we made mistake of getting from Headout which claims to offer slightly cheaper tickets. Realized it is scam. Actual amount charged is higher. Be warn of this.

A good pair of walking shoes needless to say as the park do not have seats around to rest at all.

I must be visiting Night Safari the umpteenth time over the last 15 years, but it does not seem there have been much changes to the format and structure. The ‘Creatures of the Night’ show has in fact got shorter and worse, specially not worth standing in a long queue late at night.I would suggest more guided walks, with shorter performances at various stations.

The entry is crowded as people Q up 45 minutes before the time slot. reception was good. The fire show at the entrance is good. There are restaurants at the entrance including two Indian ones. The one near the reception sells some indian snacks. The one near the exit is expensive.
immediately after the entrance you have the long Q for the tram which takes you around the Zoo with a commentry which is well timed. The animals are trained to stay at the clearing with a small information and story about these animals. The authorities have done a great job taming the wide animals which are seen not to make any noise and stay at one place for the entire show. Even the hyenas stay put.
The duration of the tram ride is about 20-25 minutes and each tram has three carts with a seating capacity of around 50-60 people per ride. The frequency of the ride is 7-10minutes. Yes the ride will give a satisfaction of seeing many animals which is a great success for the show.
there are 4 trails around the park which will be thrilling.
The creatures of the night shows was not a good one but you see some animals coming and going, but you can see people lining for it even 30 minutes before the show time which is at 7 15, 8 30, 9 30pm and the show lasts for 20-25 minutes.
Only one toilet facility available inside the campus.

We had our dinner at Jungle Rotisserie, the foods was good! Especially the mushroom soup

Be there early, so that you could catch the Thumbuakar Performance (Fire show) while having dinner at Jungle Rotisseries. This is the fire show at the entrance courtyard (located at the outdoor siting of Jungle Rotisseries) which is performed at 07.00pm, 8.00pm, 9.00pm and 10.00pm.

Take note that you will have to queue at least 30mins prior to start of Creatures of the Night Show. The seat are limited, hence be there early to grab a good seat. It is a 20-minute Creatures of the Night Show Performed in the big outdoor amphitheatre amidst the rainforest, this show is weather permitting and is performed at 7.30pm, 8.30pm, 9.30pm and 10.30pm.

Go for tram ride after the show, usually once the night safari open, the tram queue are really long. You can play around with your route. We love the tram ride, as it is really close to the animals and very much different from day time. Trust me, you dont just see their eyes!

Proposed itinerary*:-
6pm Dinner at Jungle Rotisseries
7pm Thumbuakar Performance
7.15pm Queue for Creatures of the Night Show
7.30pm Creatures of the Night Show
8.00pm Queue for Tram ride
9.00pm Own leisure

After entering the park, most visitors have a choice of 3 main activities, catch the wildlife show, take a tram ride, or go for a trail walk to see the animals. Nothing really wrong about it, just felt jaded. Be prepared to spend 2-3 hours at the place.

Logistics definitely needs to improve. These include
- Shifting the ticket booth closer to the main entrance
- Having something to keep the crowd ‘entertained’ while waiting in the queue area for the “Creatures of the Night”show. Does the crowded really need to stand about in semi darkness too?
- Better lighted park’s trail especially at the edges.
- Placing some seat along the trail near the animals enclosure for rest break and viewing the display.

Staff are mostly friendly and helpful. Tram ride was informative and a good way to see the whole park. The whole eco theme being weave into the “Creature of the Night” show was also a nice touch and interesting.

If you are lucky, you may even catch the feeding of the animals while exploring the trails.

The park has lots of potential to improve the overall visitor’s experiences and encourage repeat visits just need more attention to details.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:47:54.848312

I think that the management need to consider putting a ticket booth by the night safari entrance - otherwise you have to walk to the zoo ticket booth to get your night safari tickets and back track all the back to the night safari entrance.

The waiting time to board the trams that take you through the park was about 40 minutes. The excitement built up - but in reality the tour felt like we were watching everything in shades of grey. You are not allowed to take flash photography - and so it is not possible to take good photos of the animals.

It was interesting to see the animals in their natural habitat - although I guess most were used to tourists passing by on the trams.

All in all - I felt that it was an expensive tour for what was on offer. I would have preferred to go to the zoo during the day time.

To get to the night safari, we took the bus - but thankful that as it was late at night when we finished our tour - buses were still running.

There is a dining area where there is a choice of some eating stations serving different cuisines. I found the prices to be on the high side and did not think that it represented value for money.",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:47:55.248580

It was a very wonderful experience as it was the first for my 7yrs old daughter. During the whole night safari tram ride, she was very excited as she gets to learn first hand experience in identifying the different types of nocturnal animals, which is fantastic!

We've got the 7:15pm ticket entry (English tram ride) booked in-advance through klook.com, but we paid additional for VIP ride at the counter, for that, we don't have to que as long as the others and had a shorter entrance path to the tram, also, we were each given a free headset for the trip too (though you can use your own headset). The narrator recorded for the ride are very clear and had made the trip pleasantly interesting. We also have ample time to have our early dinner and rest before the tram ride.

The whole tram ride was perfect! it had been raining earlier during the day so by night, it was cooler and the animals actually came out to play so we were lucky to see the animals clearly in the dark. Though we didn't get to do the walking trail as our daughter were getting tired after the tram ride but as the whole visit is very much worthwhile!

There are walking trails and an interactive tram trail(40 minutes). We chose the later as we travelled with a couple of kids.

Tram service is quite pleasant and informative. Spotting animals is not a problem at all. Much like the day zoo, most of the animals were in open area with natural formations separating them from us.

Flash photography is prohibited. So not much to capture the experience.

Creatures of the night show is good. Yet another unique aspect of the night safari.

You get to see the wild animals in their natural form , being wild. Singapore night safari was basically for people's entertainment and to earn money , nothing to preserve the animals in their natural form or habitat.

Tip two: good walking shoes and even though it’s night, it’s pretty warm so be prepared for it and wear appropriate clothing.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/KT_mel,622072711,04-10-2018,3,Average experience,"Visited on a Tuesday off peak weeknight with the family.

Commenting solely on the night safari animals, there were a reasonable number of different animals for viewing, carnivores and herbivores etc, in the dark in a ‘not so’ natural habitat (which makes tram ride viewing possible). There were also a few no shows.

The creatures of the night presentation was entertaining with some interaction with the audience, but we’ve seen better.

That’s about where the positives end. The queue for the tram was more than double the duration of the ride. Imagine what it would be like during peak periods. Unfortunately I’d imagine this is not an issue with an easy solution. Some patrons within the tram were yelling out and chattering loudly amongst themselves making it difficult to hear the recorded commentary and disturbing the overall experience, and probably the animals as well. Although there were signs stating not to be loud during the ride, perhaps more direct and strict emphasis by park staff should be made prior to setting off.

Although we were told the Night Safari was one of the must do activities when visiting Singapore, I would leave it up to friends to decide if they would visit rather than definitely recommending it to them.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:48:03.799220

We were extremely lucky to see EVERY animal active and within reasonable distance. We enjoyed the tram ride & we loved wandering the trails in the moonlight too - really different experience to see the animals in an evening environment, even managed to catch some feedings (hippos & rhinos!!). Didn't bother with the shows too crowded, but managed to catch the fire show in the queue waiting for entry which was short but entertaining.

Appreciate it is a popular attraction however it all felt very staged once inside and seated on the tram with the animal enclosure viewing. There are also night walks you can do down to see the animals once you have disembarked from the tram however at that late hour and with a young child they start to feel tired and not so keen on the 40 minute round trip walk time to view the animals.

Let's face it: of course the animals still live in cages, only that they are beautifully embedded in the rainforest, so that the fences are invisible. Big trenches separate visitors from the animal in most enclosures. Also, the enclosures did not seem larger than in good modern Zoos nowadays since all animals 'presented' themselves to the passing train cars (why not electric instead of the noisy and polluting petrol ones used?) that carry the visitors. We couldn't see a lot of hiding places for them. Whether or not the animals feel stressed by the light and the masses of visitors passing by in the train cars remains unclear.But hey, it is a Zoo and also we were going there to actually see the animals and would have been disappointed to not seeing the lions.. so it remains a trade-off and a personal ethical decision as with all animal attractions.What we liked was that they provide good information about animal welfare and how to protect the species. They seem to support a lot of projects around the world to protect wildlife and make people more aware of the dangers. Of course (it is Singapore!) it is a immaculate park, super clean and well organised. Lots of food places to spend time. We would not recommend the animal though.I give it an average rating since for us it didn't fulfil our expectation of this 'open wild', rather it is a good Zoo with a theme park-like touch where you are driven through by train car instead of walking. Worth a visit to support their wildlife welfare programs and to inform your kids about how endangered some are and what we can do about it.",09-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:48:32.878782

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/AbhimanyuSinghi,614370974,06-09-2018,2,Overcrowded and Overhyped,"Night Safari is a tourist attraction omnipresent in all Singapore itineraries. But why? Before you decide to go here remember you are paying for it. And paying for what exactly?
When you buy the tickets for the safari you are assigned a time slot for entry 7:30 pm, 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm. If you are in the first slot then by 7 pm there is already a queue of more than fifty people each in every entry line. And this line is to only get inside the Night Safari. Handy tip is to take the left most queue as that is the only one from which you get a view of the Thumbuakar (Fire Dance) performance.
Once entry starts there will be a mad rush to get into the lines for the Night Safari Tram. Entry took us about 15 minutes and we decided to not get into the Tram instantly. Instead we moved straight for the Creatures of the Night show. There is quite a rush for this as well because this shows are limited and show timings fixed. We managed to get a good enough spot but the show was nothing great.
Another mad rush to get out of the show once it's over and stand in the Tram lines. Luckily by now the crowds had subsided considerably and we were able to get into a tram in 10 minutes. The entire tram ride with its audio commentary lasted about 20-25 minutes. It was informative but the actual sightings are a hit and miss thing. We couldn't locate quite a few animals in the dark and didn't have enough energy to come back to the enclosures using a walking trail. In fact we hardly saw anyone on the walking trails. So I guess everyone just came for the show and the tram ride.
Post the tram ride we went for our buffet Indian dinner at the Ulu Ulu restaurant which was included in our tickets. The food was poor to say the least. The buffet spread had a green salad counter, 2 vegetarian curries, 1 daal, 2 types of rice, naan, papad and ice cream. That's it. So no choice at all. We barely managed to fill our stomachs and were too tired to go anywhere else.
Our cab back to the hotel was booked for 10:30 pm but we were out by 9:15 and decided to just take a taxi rather than wait so long.
If you want to experience what a night safari is like then it's worth a visit but if you want to see animals or explore wildlife then this is just a waste of time. You should rather spend more time in the zoo or the bird park. And don't book tickets with the dinner buffet included because the Indian dinner was just pathetic.",09-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:48:49.046546

So nice to see the animals awake, eating and moving about. We were ushered straight from the tram to sit around 25 mins to wait for the 2nd show. It was packed out by 8.05pm so make sure you get in early. The show was good but too much time taken on audience participation or sending message to people to turn off flashes.

I was somewhat amused to hear the recorded message saying “rhino horns and elephant tusks are causing their extinction, so please don’t kill them!”

Looking around the buggy, I noted that most guests were of chinese extraction who ironically are the culprits in their extinction. No shifting around uncomfortably in their seats to show any form of remorse.

Anyhow, 40 mins later, we ended up back at the start. Thank God! Another 45 minute aircon taxi ride back to Sentosa.

The best part? The aircon taxi which brought us home. Don’t bother doing this attraction. They are taking the piss charging this amount and giving you a night time sweaty golf buggy ride!

Yes, my 2 & 4 year old loved it... BUT... they’d love ANYTHING that got them from going to bed at their normal time!",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:49:07.697387

The animals are alive and kicking during the night. We even got to experience a lion's roaring or wolves howling when they are usually asleep during the daytime.

Ticket sales are open from 5:30 pm daily. There are a few options - One is the Night Safari tour via tram and Two, you can explore on your own via foot.

If you choose the tram option - If you have a choice, DO NOT, I repeat do not choose the 7:15 pm or 8:15 pm slot like everybody else. If you do, be prepared to queue at least 45 minutes to get unto the tram. Choose the 9:15 pm or 10:15 pm slot when the queues are much shorter and less stressful for you and your family.",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:49:08.336640

After waiting 20 minutes we gave up and needed a toilet, Then we were told we had to go out again. No thanks. So we started walking and for some places where there were no crowds it was really nice to see the animals, what we really came for. But in most of the stops the crowds were too big for the space so me and my daughter could not see anything. We went to the lion feed and by climbing on the fence and my daughter on my husbands shoulder, we could see the lions and that was great.

Lots of children asleep in parents arms as well as prams. Seeing some trams with only two people in seats until finally our turned. Then others were jammed in with us.
Our son did so well to wait soooooo long. Finally on our way no flash photography but that's okay as at least 1/3 of the animals were hiding anyway.
This firstly would be better if they could work the hrs in with zoo or safari so folks could would have something to do in between second show.

THey should not admit as many people - the whole thing becomes a stressful exercise in waiting in lines.
The show is ok, but not worth the wait, especially as two thirds of the auditorium are reserved for bus tours. The tram tour is ok too, but you don't see half as many animals as advertised. Basically a tour in the dark, which is fun, but overhyped.
THe food at the cafeteria is mediocre.
Why not a ticket counter at the Night Safari itself, instead of making people walk all the way back to the Zoo entrance?

The queues at 8pm were huge and we were in low season on a school night. We were hearded to the night show, which we knew nothing about and was ok but aimed at younger children really. Once we were out we were then in the queue with everyone else for the trams which was about 30 mins. It was only then did we see the walks around the zoo. I'd advise:
1. Arrive as late as you can.
2. Walk around the zoo first as there are some great things to see and you let the queues go down.
3. Take the tram, timing it before the show kicks out (around 5 to the hour and 25 past the hour) when the queues are the least.
4. Then, if you have children go to see the show but by then it is quite late.
5. Buy tickets on line and download them on your phone then head for the shortest queue possible to get in!

Pros
Open safari not closed in netted van.
If you want night experience in jungle it is good.
Shows are good to experience.,but not better than jurongpark. Instead shows in singapore zoo much more better.

Cons
You can or cannot see animals, at times not clear.
Waiting queue huge not worth waiting for, put some more money for express trams.
No photos possible due to dim or no lights.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/John R R,606083006,13-08-2018,2,Sadly really disappointing,"After all the positive recommendations, our trip to the Night Safari was really a disappointment.

Booking on-line resulted in a number of phone calls because the e-tickets couldn't be sent and on arrival it isn't clear where to go (you have to go to the zoo to collect).

We were early so decided to eat there, which was a mistake - what we bought wasn't available when collecting the order, the food (chicken) was then stone cold and finding a table was really very difficult - lots of people sitting there having a drink waiting for their entry time (not knocking them, just not enough general seating around). When we found a table we needed to clear it and then do our best to clean it (there wasn't enough staff clearing and cleaning tables). I've added a picture of a wipe that showed how dirty the table was, which surprised us as Singapore in generally so clean.

Once in, it is confusing which tram lane you can and can't use, we ended up in lane 1 on direction of the staff who just waved us in a direction of a queue. it then took an hour and half to get to the front (I wasn't happy with the number of people who skipped the queue/ pushed in because they had family or friends already in the queue keep a place for them (which I hate when you have stood there queuing in the heat for an hour or so).

Once at the front, the trams for lane 1 were arriving pretty much full (at least 4 or 5 arrived like this that I saw) and used our queue the fill any empty seats (mainly seats for two people only, which doesn't help if you have a family of 4). Any empty trams were going straight to lane 2 (which had smaller queues). Seemed really disorganised and when I asked why we were waiting for so long and why the trams were arriving full I just got a blank look!

I would still recommend the visit, however I wouldn't eat there again and would investigate the queue situation before choosing which queue to join (if there is a option). There are at least 4 or 5 tram queues and perhaps we were too eager to join the first queue we came across.",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:49:50.808630

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JinWeeT,604224419,08-08-2018,4,Worthwhile despite horrendous queues,"I’ve visited the Night Safari 4 or 5 times, practically every time I visit Singapore. It’s the one thing we seem to absolutely have to do when we’re in town. The kids never seem to fall out of love with it.

Over the years, it’s gotten more and more crowded, and more and more expensive. It’s still worth going to though.

Here’s what you get for your SGD47 a head. There’s a tram ride, about 30 minutes long, where you can see various macrofauna in a night environment. The lighting is discreet, and is just bright enough that you can make out what’s going on, yet continue to shroud the animals in shadow if they wish. This is the highlight of the visit.

My favourite part of the tram ride is the tapir exhibit, where the tapirs will often come right up to the tram. Keep your fingers in the tram - tapirs bite! As tapirs are active mostly at night, it’s a unique opportunity to see these animals when they’re not asleep.

Sadly, the number of instances where tourists ignore instructions and use flash photography seems to have increased. On my last visit there were at least 3 people using flashes on the tram, despite the driver telling them not to. I hope they enforce this rule better.

The queues for the tram can be long. We queued for 20 minutes at about 9pm. You can skip the queue for SGD10 a head. But a far better solution is to get on at about 7.30 or 8 when it’s less crowded.

There’s also three walking trails that feature animals and exhibits you can’t see on the tram ride. I like the pangolins in particular. You can also see an assortment of cats, from the usual big cats (lions and tigers) to the more unusual (clouded leopard, serval and fishing cat).

There’s a great moment on the fishing cat trail where you cross a bridge over a pond. Halfway through, if you look down, more often than not you’ll see a 8 foot gharial below you.

It’s a good idea to bring mosquito repellent, as the trails are outdoors in a jungle environment. Also, avoid the tour groups (easier said than done, on some nights), as many nocturnal animals are shy, and tour groups are noisy, despite much effort from the staff and tour guides to shush them.

There are also 3 animal shows each evening. They’re not very long, are usually crowded, and more often than not I skip them.

You can get a drink or ice cream at various cafes throughout the Night Safari, but the main catering options are outside. There’s a large food court, with many Asian food options outside the entrance. You can re-enter if you get a stamp on your hand when you exit. While eating, you can enjoy the fire dancers performing.

I still recommend a visit, although the crowds are somewhat off putting. Let’s see how long it remains worth a visit.",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:50:00.146400

The tram line after the show was a one hour wait so we walked instead. The problem is that you cannot get on the tram halfway which makes it very inflexible. So you have to choose to walk or to take the tram.
Walking, we got to see animals up close if they choose to come out. But can be tiring for little kids. Bat cave was cool because you can see it up close. And the black bears were out for us to see. When we finished at 930pm, the queue for the tram was for at least another hour. So we skipped it. We took the city express double decker bus to Orchard Road and that was fun for kids.

The website is very poor. Almost impossible to find basic information such as opening times, admission times (until you get into the ticketing page) etc etc. It is also not possible to buy tickets for Singaporeans and non Singaporeans together on the same cart: this is a basic flaw

On site, there were no signs at all to the fire show whatsoever.

The crowds were huge, especially waiting for the tram. Why are there so few trams and why are some trams idle?

Most enclosures were so poorly lit that the animals were barely shapes.

The lion enclosure was very poorly landscaped so the lions could hide just by lying down

Conservation propaganda overwhelmed the website and the tram voice guide at the expense of useful information

My husband’s nephews came for a visit - all the way from LA. And we were so excited to show them the Night Safari.

To our disappointment, this has turned into another money-grabbing operation.

The foodcourt (I repeat it’s a FOODCOURT not restaurant) charged us $20 each for our meals which are simple chicken rice sets or chicken tikka which we had to queue and get ourselves. Like in any regular foodcourt. We were a family of 5 so we pretty much had a $100 food court meal.

We didn’t mind paying the price of the Night Safari tickets for 5 as we felt this would be awesome. Till we were faced with the HUGE CROWDS entering. The queue for the tram was never-ending. We would have wasted an hour of the time we had just queuing for the tram.

It was never like this 3-4 years ago. We could just queue for 10 mins and get into a tram.

We decide to forgo the tram which was such a shame as a whole section of the park was only accessible by tram.

We went on foot. And crowds were EVERYWHERE we walked. It was like walking in a busy mall on a weekend. Bodies everywhere. People cramming their faces to the glass display to see the animals. It was so so so unpleasant.

I’m so sad - cos I loved the Night Safari so much. I know they’ve restricted ticket entries to certain timings, but IMO could use more restriction.

Full review: I was very disappointed and dissatisfied with the night safari. We had very limited time on the island and this was very highly recommended. The crowds and the entry ticket prices are very high .
There really was nothing special in terms of the animals you see or the tram ride at night. It is a tram ride through the zoo with the animals dimly lit with fluorescent light.
You might as well see the animals in full brightness of day . We had to wait in line for 60 minutes to get on the tram .
The Creatures of the night show was not very impressive either. The show hosts made their best effort to make it informative and amusing, but it did not live up to the hype . We had seats on one end of the stadium and we could not see a number of the animals - very poor stadium design",07-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:51:04.643009

Surrounded by noisy Chinese tourists that for some reasons kept shouting at each other while waiting. We were then hoping to have a quiet time on the train that takes us around the night safari. Unfortunately we were blasted with horrible music and boring pre-recorded commentaries along the ride. We were hoping for a pleasant ride but it was noisy and the seats rather uncomfortable (some kind of PVC which gets hot and sticky in tropical Singapore.

When we had to look at animals, we actually had to look for animals. It is indeed dark and animals are not waiting by the noisy train to be spotted. So basically you cant see anything. Whats the point to do this expensive ride if one cant see anything. Actually most of the train passengers were on their phone chatting after realizing that there was nothing to see. Whatever you may be able to spot is surely not worth any of queuing time and crazy expensive tickets. My kids were disappointed at the end of the 30' ride, I was relieved that this torture was ending. We took a SGD 50 taxi to go back to town and called it a night.

The night safari promises a lot. It is indeed very well-branded and beautifully marketed but the actual visit is a dead boring and not worth the SGD 250 my family had to pay.

I dont think the Night Safari is a nice way to end your day at the Zoo (which is in contrast a lot better than the Night Safari) nor is the night Safari a worthwhile attraction on its own. Their team must revised the price and the attraction. Otherwise it will stay a tourist trap for unsophisticated tourists.

The location of night safari is far away from main city, usually takes around a hour or more to get there. Night safari includes a show which could be some what said the best part of the safari. After the 30 min show you can go on a free tram ride of night safari. The driver keeps telling information and details about the animals passing by in cages. Most of the animals aren't visible due to low lightning and some animals are said to be sleeping. In short you take a small ride through a forest of about 20 minutes of airport carts.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/jade_du,595485252,12-07-2018,1,Extremely disappointing,"I have been to the Night Safari quite a few times before. We visited the night safari in the last week of June 2018. The weather had been erratic for Singapore - rather wet instead of the dry spell that it often is in June, so we decided to book our tickets only when there would be no chance of rain(ie. the day itself). In our party were 6 adults and a child. We were visiting Arab Street and saw cheaper tickets for the Night Safari being sold at a hotel tickets for that same day). We decided to book our tickets there. Unfortunately, there was only the 9.15 slot available. Never having heard of time slots for the night safari, I was rather surprised, but decided to go ahead as we were taking family around and it was their last couple of days in Singapore. In the process of booking the tickets, we realised that we could not book the child's ticket. So after having paid for the 6 adults, we went online and saw that there were tickets available for the 7.15pm slot!!! I ended up booking the child ticket for that time slot and we decided to go early to the Night Safari and try our luck.
We got there at 8.45pm. I explained our situation. They were gracious enough to let us in earlier as a gesture of goodwill. After getting sorted, we decided to queue for the show. That was a huge mistake. We waited in line for the show - we were the first in the queue. The show started at 9.30 and ended at 10 pm (30 mins). Then we decided to take the tram - it was just outside the the entrance where the show was. We waited for a bit and after our tram ride (it was rather dark, we mainly saw different species of deer (layman's terms!), we decided to do the walking trail. Halfway through our trail, we had to turn back (11.45pm). The Night safari was closing, so we did not get the see the rest of the place!!! We didn't even complete the Fishing Cat trail!! So we didn't even complete ONE trail. Extremely miffed, after all, the tickets aren't cheap, I decided to approach the counter staff at the entrance.

I explained our situation. They eventually let us go back to the Night Safari on another night, for free to complete the other trails. Unfortunately, two people in our group could not go back though - due to the time constraint.

I did ask them why they sold tickets which only allowed people to go at 9.15 and was told (to my horror) that there was even a later slot. They did say that there are some people who go there JUST for the tram ride or just to do a walk or just to say been there, done that, with photos to prove.

So.....If you want to go to the Night Safari, there are couple of things to remember...

1) Only go if you are not averse to crowds. It IS very crowded.
2) Book in advance and get the earliest slot possible.
3) If you are on a tight budget and don't have much time, skip this Singapore attraction.
4) If you really want to ""experience the place"", set aside the whole night for the hours.
1-2 hours won't be enough.
5)If you are in Singapore only for a short period of time but want to do either the Night Safari or the zoo, do the zoo.",06-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:51:20.150852

Such a different zoo experience & we thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommend it.

Fortunately there were not many people around for the 10.15 slot and the staff said as long as we had the 4 park hopper ticket, it was fine that we could enter in the next slot.

Experience -
The night show got cancelled so for me it turned out to be a ride via a tram for around 30-40 mins in the night.The concept is definitely unique but i did not find it to be worth the visit , especially if you have done the Zoo which has a much more wide range of animals. After around 40 mins tram ride and seeing some of the animals in the dark , we were dropped at the point where we started and that was the end of the Night Safari for us.
* There is absolutely no point in carrying the camera as you would not be able to get any pictures.
* There are plenty of restaurants at the entry and you can get snacks and stuff . Most of it was closed when we left so make sure you have stuff to eat before entering ( if you are going in the 10.15 PM slot )
* Easy to find a taxi to the place and out of the place. An Important Tip - We came in from orchard road and i was first trying to ask the Cabs if they would go towards Night Safari and all of them refused. SO Please get into the cab and then only tell them that you want to go towards the Safari , for some reason the drivers are not that keen on making the drive to that place and if you ask them , they would say no.",06-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:51:40.090869

You are also able to take a walk around the zoo and see all the animals at night, this is just over an hours walk.

The safari set-up is amazing! It was an incredible experience to see animals freely roaming in beautiful habitats, and like everywhere in Singapore, it was very clean and well-presented. Our kids were absolutely thrilled to see so many animal species, some of which we had never seen or heard of before. The concept of the tram tour through the habitats was excellent. The only downside was that we visited on a Sunday night and it was extremely crowded and busy. We went to see the animal show first, which was entertaining, but then we had to wait in a long queue for at least an hour to get on a tram. Luckily the tram ride was good, so it was worth the long wait, but if I went again, I would try to choose a much less busy night to attend - especially with the kids in tow. The other negative was that we had arrived by taxi, and when we left, there was an enormous queue at the taxi stand. We were fortunate to find a group of people travelling to the same area as us and we hired a private minibus to our hotel. Without this stroke of good luck though, I imagine we may have been in that taxi line for hours, which would not have been pleasant with two young tired children...

In the past, there was a tour guide on the tram that gave live commentary on the animals. Now there is only a recording. Also previously, the tram made at least one stop midway through and people had the option to get off and walk around. Now the tram just makes one big round to get back to the park entrance.

I haven't been to Singapore's zoo, so can't compare, but the Night Safari was pretty good. From other reviews, we may have been lucky, as we went midweek at a quiet time and saw almost all the animals. Our visit was in two parts. The first was a 45 minute tram ride, for which we had to queue for about 20 minutes. This is pretty much completely in the dark, but dim lighting is present in the enclosures. The range of animals is impressive: the tram ride includes sightings of Asian elephants, tiger, lions, hyenas, hippos, rhinos, various species of deer and varieties of pigs. The ride is accompanied by an American voiceover commentary which is informative but characterless and a bit too self-promotional of all the ""great"" conservation work Night Safari does. while this is no doubt true the way it comes across is more Hello! magazine than Blue Planet. It would also be good if the tram stopped for a couple of minutes in complete darkness and silence to enhance the sense of the tropical night. The second part was a lengthy self-guided walk on carefully constructed trails, which was often exciting, and gave a chance to revisit some of the animals seen from the tram plus a lot of others, such as otters, badgers, enormous fruit bats, wallabies, (including a joey in its pouch), various smaller cats and more deer. It feels quite intimate as the animals are quite close, which adds to the whole effect. A few points. First, it is definitely best to go as late as possible, as the animals are probably more active then and the place is quieter. Second, take plenty of patience and bug spray. Don't bother with a camera! This is one place where memories need to be in the mind! Patience is needed as the animals need to be looked for in some of the enclosures. The light is very dim and many creatures are camouflaged, so allow time for eyes to get used to the light levels and look hard. The further away we went from the entrance area the better the experience. Next, the food, drink and souvenir outlets are very expensive, so be warned. The whole entrance area is devoted to a food court and shops with very loud music permanently coming through the speakers. I recommend booking tickets in advance using the Wildlife Reserve Singapore website and taking the order number to the desk on arrival, where the ticket will be printed for you. The website also offers the option of a multi-park ticket. Finally, just to note we arrived at about 8.30 and left at about 11.30 by taxi. It wasn't a problem getting a cab. It was more difficult explaining to the driver where we needed to go! Overall this was a very good experience, but I can see that it is also possible to have a negative experience if the place is very busy.",06-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:51:58.268165

The Amphitheater presentation was really good. The presenter was very animated and has a great sense of humor.

The night safari tram ride was one of a kind of experience. Although I did worried about some animals jumping on the tram during the ride but it was absolutely safe. All of our body parts are still intact and all three kids are still with me at the end of the ride (although the 7 yr old almost dozed off with the cool night breeze during the ride).

The only incident that truly irked me during this visit was the group of Indian tourist who cut in line while everyone was queueing for their turn. The situation was so chaotic and there’s NO staffs around to help monitor the situation and control the crowd. It was unfair for the rest of us who follow rules and regulation while there are a group of adults unclipping the barriers and cut in front of others with young children and senior citizens. They even have the nerve to ask us let their friends move up the line because I’ve decided not to let them cut in front of my children. One of the Indian man even touched my 10 year old son’s face with both his hands and kept looking and smiling at him. I was shocked, what’s happening in this safe country???

My review may appear contrary to what people are 'expecting' about Night Safari.

Being an Animal/Nature Lover, the word Safari, for me, is filled with a lot of sight-seeing and excitement and lots of animals in their wild best! The Night Safari at Singapore Zoo did not invoke any of those feelings. It turned out to be a Damp squib.

It was more Drama and less Reality. There is nothing unique that was showcased at this event.

The long Queues to get into the Tram made it worse.

There is nothing worthwhile to remember about this Safari.

Its Just another way for the Zoo to earn a little more money by giving a ""night safari"" tag to an extremely boring Tram ride.

There was a Fire show/stunt at the Entrance of Night Safari, which was good, but it is a totally ""disconnected"" event and i am wondering why it needs to be there at the Night Safari.

And then there was an Animal Show, where a few nocturnal animals were ""displayed"".

This show was high on Drama (and Rhetoric) and low on Animals/birds or their activities. Its a total waste of time. The Presenter of this Show was the only Saving grace and the only thing good to talk about this show. Nothing else is good about this animal show.

I have seen extremely engaging animal shows at other Zoos that almost captivate you and make you look forward for an another show!

I must add here that the experience at the Day Zoo was just the Opposite, it was an extremely awesome experience. I highly recommend you to visit the Zoo during the day instead.

And here is my review about it -
https://www.tripadvisor.in/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r590047506-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

We went right at 7:30, and you do get to see a lot of the animals, but usually for only a few seconds. Don't even think about getting any pictures either. The animals are nocturnal, so they don't allow flash photography. The creatures of the night show was nice, but it was definitely catered towards children. You have the option of walking the trials and seeing the animals at your own pace, but it is a little creepy walking on your own in the dark.

The restaurant staff was great as well.
The only issue I had was with the tram staff. When lining up for the tram, I was told to fold my stroller, and I had to drag it through the line. The staff could have easily taken it from me and set it aside until we got to the front of the line as there was space to the side of the line. Also, other local guests pushed their strollers through the line and only folded them once they got to the front. Additionally, when we got off the tram, no one could tell me where the stroller was. I finally found it laying on the ground at the front of the tram (we were all the way in the back.) This is ridiculous. Lots of families come here, so you would think they would do a better job trying to help out their guests.

Was a sensible decision as the number of people coming in really start swelling up with the passing of every minute. Were able to manage some sitting space at amphitheatre... However, the show was nothing great ... Not up to the level of what we've seen at other places and safaris ... But still okay for the little ones ...

Towards the end it starting raining but all was managed well... Overall, a good decent outing ... More for the kids outing ...
As for reaching the place, it's recommended to take a cab as the public transport is not very well linked.

The actual attraction itself once you get on the tram is a joke, the tram drives way to fast to see anything, especially if you’re sitting in the back.

This is a separate attraction, right next to the Singapore Zoo, full of all the nocturnal animals. The park's lighting has been specially designed to be only as bright as the full moon, and since animals are used to that, they are awake and active. Photography with flashlight is strictly prohibited. Since most of the animals are moving their photographic images are blurred. As one enters the park, welcome counters extend assistance. There are restaurants and gift shops also. The mood is built up by the Thumbuakar performance as pyro warriors demonstrate their fire-twirling skills to the beat of jungle drums.
We took the Tram ride and came across flamingos, a variety of deers, giraffes, hyenas, lions, elephants, rhinos, tapirs, tigers, etc.

It also stopped everywhere going back and was an open aired bus which on the top deck was interesting / fun on a motorway.

Anyhow back to the Safari. It was amazing. Tip avoid the tram as big queues and you don’t get close to the animals. Head straight for the show then the walking trails. The walking trials are close to the animal enclosures and you really feel almost like you are in a Kenyan game park camp apart from you know the animals are in an enclosed zone. The animals are alert and nocturnal ones active. We were lucky to tag behind a game keeper that was feeding so brilliant. Really enjoyed the bat walk through with swooping fruit bats around you. There were quite. Few places to eat but we didn’t have time to stop there due to the bus.

Tram ride (night Safari) is not to be missed where guests can actually hear the sound and see the animals closely in the dark.
Tram drivers always warn the passengers not to flash the mobile camera as the animals during dark get distracted and disturbed.

Once through the entrance we headed straight for the show. The literature and entrance tickets here are slightly misleading... we had an 815 entrance and were expecting to head straight to the 830 show. As it is we were allowed in around 745 and joined the very end of the queue for the 830 show at that time. So if we had come in at 815 we would have missed it and probably the next one. Anyway, the show was below average and not really worth the queuing anyway so bear that in mind when planning your trip.

The system for queuing for the tram was ok and as it was late the queues were quite short. The tram ride was an enjoyable experience and we got to see all the animals albeit mostly sitting doing nothing rather than roaming as we had hoped.

Plan- Night safari starts in the late evening and in our case we took the entry at 9:15 Pm. You can buy tickets at gate/Online/Headway app etc. We found a good price via Headway app.

The place is a little outskirts of Singapore though Taxi and Buses ply and Uber is also there. We preferred Uber and it was safe.

Entry - At the entry there was a Fire Show with athletics and fire in Jungle costumes by 3-4 people and it was open for all while half the crowd was sitting and half standing to get the closer view.

It’s important to keep your self Hyderabad and there are taps using which you can fill your bottles or buy packed bottles.

Post this show we went to the Animal show . It was an open air theater with sitting at the multi level stairs and front for the Anchor and Animals to perform. The show lasted for about 30 mind including Pictures with the Panther/Owl etc.

During the show we were spell bound by the performance of Animals which performed to the instructions of the trainers. It was fun for kids and during the show they take volunteers from crowd and give goodies for their support.

Third and longest was the real Night safari in which about 16 people go together in a guided tram. During the safari we saw so many animals like Lion, elephant,deer, hippopotamus, Bear, Wild cow. There is a recorded guidance and information about wild life, animals, their preservation and what’s being done to maintain the eco system, How our visit makes the difference. It’s really inspirational and educational to know and be aware. Kids had a great time. Post that one can buy goodies/Souvenirs.

Then it’s the time to say goodbye, we exited the zoo arround 12 am. Overall a very good experience for the family. Recommend it!",03-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:54:13.374219

Lots of restaurants at the exit so you can grab dinner and head back. We took the metro to Khatib and then the Mandai Khatib Shuttle to the safari. It was easy and cheap, but bear in mind that you need a metro card for the shuttle bus as they dont accept cash payment.

I tried both Saex and taxi to get there.

Saex is cheap option but sometimes it delayed, especially when you get back to the city. Taxi is highly recomended if there are.

If you reserve your ticket via online then you just need to show your ticket on your phone to the staff. It’d be better to reserve ticket on 19:15.

You should come earlier than entry time then you can watch fire show at entrance while standing on the line. (Which starts at 19:00)

And go straight for the Creature of the night show starts at 19:30. There are still sunlight at that time. After that you can ride a tram or walk along the trails.

You will see some animals go through beside a tram. I still wonder how they can. I didn’t see any fence around those animal. Tiger or lion is rare to see if you don’t get right timing. There is no chance to take a picture because light around is not enough and tram runs quite fast. It also takes time to find animal under the shadow. Just see and remember with your own eyes.
They service other language options on tram. You just need birng your earphone with wire (not bluetooth).
There is a photo time before tram starts. Sit on the left if you want to get a photo.

If you walk along the trail, you can see the animals from other view with more time.
Still, lion and tiger is hard to see.
But animals like reptiles, cloud leopard you can only see on the walking trail. But it is still hard to find those animal. Just like hide and seek.
There are restroom and drink seller on the middle of the trails.

This place is well made. It is a good chance for both kid and adult to have a new experience for Zoo at night.",02-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:54:22.237899

The earlier one can still have some light and the later ones (9.15 & 10.15) don't really allow you to do much else apart from the tram ride, as you can't do the walks before the tram and the show is then too late if you have kids.
However the experience is great. We did the River Safari (don't be fooled, just because it has ""river"" in the title this does not mean it is in a boat). The River Safari walks you around a river themed zoo, which is actually quite intestine and we'll displayed. My favourite bits were the crocs and the giant pandas!! There are plenty of places to eat and sit. We had a two hour wait, and it wasn't even that bad. There is a fire dancing show just outside the Night Safari entrance which is obviously designed to keep waiting customers happy and entertained. It does the job. Once throigh thr Night Safari entrance there is plenty of cueing ti get on the trams. However my highlight was the Asian Tiger and the elephants. The souvenirs are expensive and the food is over priced but not unusual for a place like this. Just amazing how visitors are able to be so close to the animals without any visable walls (except for the tiger...).

My 21 year old son wasn’t convinced the animals were real at first, but what concerned me was the fact that the animals were all there to be seen under the dimmed floodlight at the front of each enclosure.

Personally, I didn’t think this was natural behaviour for animals whether they were nocturnal or not as surely they would shy away from the light?

I came to the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that the enclosures must be very small and the animals had nowhere else to go but right at the front of the enclosure under the lights for the passing trams to see.

Its pretty expensive to enter and highly commercialised.
The elephant was in a small enclosure with a moat around it. He was in the corner facing the wall swaying and bobbing his head which I leant later was a sign of distress. The lions were pacing back and forth under floodlights in space about 10m long.

some animals definitely had enough space, especially the non-bitey ones that are free to roam but the whole experience made me feel guilty. I wish I hadn't supported it.

After spending the afternoon in the adjacent Zoo (which by the way, is also amazing), we had lunch in the food court as the sun set and the queues formed for the 8:15pm session. We visited during Lunar New Year, so as expected, it was really busy. We waited for probably 35-40mins for a tram, but once we were on, we were so glad we stuck around! The tram takes you from the buzz of the entrance to the quiet depths of the zoo, accompanied by an English speaking tour recording that blends informative facts with well thought out conservation messaging to perfectly submerge you in the world of the incredible creatures viewed. It was an out-of-this-world experience to be present with animals such as asiatic lions, Asian elephants and Malayan tapirs under low wattage, moonlight-like lighting. Truly magical. These wonderful creatures seemed so at ease with our presence, a signal that they live content, enriched lives. I really hope that the hoards of people that visit here have a similarly magical experience, and walk away empowered to do something to protect wildlife. Thank you, Night Safari!

PS my only suggestion to travellers would be to pick your time slot carefully during peak periods. If you’re not travelling with small kids, it may be best to opt for a later time, as a means of avoiding queues. When we left at 9:45pm, there was hardly a line for the tram, so 10:15pm might be a good option.

Nocturnal animals were found awaken & engaged in their activities in habitats closed to natural shape. We were super impressed with the range of animals including elephants, lion, tiger, hippo, rhino, hyena and so on. In some instances we were very close to the animals moving freely. There are few tram stations. It took long to complete the tour.

After enjoying the tram tour we observed the ""Creatures of the night"" show which was an excellent experience. Dramatic way to open the show, the host of the show who can speak more than 06 major languages, the animals and all the staffs are just amazing, They made the show alive and really entertaining.

What would be a one ride inside a large park in any normal amusement park, becomes a single attraction that costs 45 sgd, for a 20 minute tram ride to see some very sad and bored animals, mostly deer...
The place is overcrowded, they allow people with later time slots to enter early and so you wait 1.30 hrs to ride the tram, and basically have no time to do anything else afterwards
They of course sell you an upgrade ticket while you are online, for 10 sgd, to jump the line
they claim to be a wildlife preservation company but they are instead a very greedy one that only want to pack as many visitors s possible every night, so perhaps they donate a few cents to some non profit, but they did not convince me that they care about anything else but money, let alone the animals
The problem is not only the money, people come to singapore for few nights, and instead of spending the night walking along the river or enjoying this amazing city/nation , they spend an hour getting to this remote place, 3 hours total or a 20 minute tram ride which is crowded and packed with local families or from across the border in malaysia, with screaming kids, sweating their souls off, while the staff is rude and non caring
I don't know why the singapore tourist board endorses this attraction (they sell tickets to it, so thats approval of the quality) since this ruins the reputation of this country , where everything else is perfect
I realize the company provides a lot of local jobs and taxes to the economy, but it is an eyesore

What's Good....... It is thrilling to imagine wild animals in there natural habitat and that too at night......wow.
The safari is 25 kms away from the city and taxi took 30 dollars and 35 mins to reach the place. Entry was convinient as we pre-booked our tram tickets from VOYAGIN at 30 % discounted price.
The open tram was ready to board at the allotted time slot.
The safari started at 9:30 pm and took almost 30 mins to complete the trip with audio commentary. There were dim lights in the animal enclosure and it felt like we are very close the wild animals without any cage or protection.
Conclusion.......a must visit for every age and either go after dinner or can have food at the food joints located there. Returning from the place is easy as you get taxi as well as bus too..",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:55:22.740620

I do recommend booking ahead. Maybe even a week or more if you are going on a weekend in a holiday. They limit the number of people entering each hour. If you can get into the show early, that is great. Arrive before your admission time as they do queue up. The tram ride gives you an overview but you miss heaps and to see it all you need to do the walking tracks, just head straight for that.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:55:23.740453

You need to have a ticket for a timed entry, however, when we arrived we were faced with huge crowds and a very long wait. We arrived a little earlier than our scheduled entry time because usually they have a 'fire dance' in the restaurant however the crowds were so large we couldn't even get close enough to see any of it. Once inside, there was a huge rush for the night safari 'trains' that take you around the night safari and the night animals show was already full 30 mins before the show was supposed to start! It was quite difficult to move around for the first hour we were at the night safari. However, once we got into the 2nd show, it was great- the show was exactly the same (still good) it was the last time I'd visited 3 or so years ago! But still very entertaining and funny. There's quite a bit of walking and a few slopes. There are also a few steps/plank like parts so those may require a stroller to be held, but otherwise it's not too bad if you needed a stroller for younger kids. The paths are a bit narrow but it all adds to the jungle atmosphere. We had to keep waiting for a ride of the safari tram- over an hour before we actually got a ride! But we kept ourselves entertained walking around and looking for the animals in the dark. Kids had fun wandering around the zoo at night, but I think it would have been a much better experience if the park had been a bit more organized in staggering the entry times and controlling the crowds.",04-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:55:24.144743

Excellent experience and definitely should be purchased with the Park Hopper (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari, River Safari and Jurong Bird Park at $78 p.p) if time allows.
The tram ride is great but unless your going in peak periods I wouldn't bother with the Skip The Line Pass. We went in mid January and no issue on standard ticket. The 4 walking tracks that you can do after the tram ride are definitely worth doing. The best part is that you see a lot of the animals up close and very active as they are naturally nocturnal and when you see them during the day at a normal zoo, they tend to be at the back of the enclosure and asleep - not the case at the Night safari.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:55:24.798184

Note: The later you arrive, the less light there is to see the animals through the camera.

Our family was confused of what was to be expected, but got into line and onto to a open-air shuttle. Think Disneyland parking shuttle. From there, we drove slowly through animal enclosures taking pictures in the artificially made moonlight. It was hard getting shots to even be visible, but it was very cool to be so close to the animals. The ride lasted around 30 - 45 mins.

We followed the crowd into an animal show that got cancelled due to rain 1 minute into the show.

We then walked the Wallaby trail and found that it weaved between the roads used by the shuttles. The temperature was perfect and it was wonderful walking through the jungle seeing the animals. Definitely the best part of the safari.

Unfortunately, we had to run through half of the trail to catch the next show. Which consisted of well-trained exotic animals and fun acts. Everyone's favorite was the otters, of course.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:55:32.011114

It is not worth the pricey tickets. The animals are mangy, underfed and do not seem to be very healthy. I did not see shiny coats on any animals, always a good indicator of health. The worst were the orangutan and chimpanzees. The animals seemed bored and didn't have any or many objects to stimulate them. The enclosures aren't very large and the size of the polar bear's tank broke my heart. If you're an animal lover and can't make up your mind about the necessity of zoos, avoid this place.

I saw two shows and the one on the elephants is slightly more enjoyable though the scars on the elephants' legs told me the methods used to train them.I regret choosing to visit this tourist spot this time round. Avoid it unless you're getting free tickets somehow.

I went on the boat ride that is free...believe me that I would have been very bummed had I to buy a ticket. You see only undergrowth and the tops of a few giraffes. The 1 hour wait was not worth the ride.

I had gone to the Night Safari in 2016 and that was a more enjoyable experience. That I would say is worth the expensive ticket.

We made our way to the to the amphitheatre for the show but was told that its full house and we were not allowed in. imagine the disappointed and the difficulty explaining this to our 3yr old daughter. you guys simply over sold the tickets to us in my opinion, your staff can still have the cheek to say this is a complimentary show, come on we paid good money into the night safari what the hell do you mean its complimentary nothing is free in their world. thinking this leads to no where arguing with your usher we decided to move along.

we saw a long never ending queue for the tram to tour the night safari, and was deciding whether to walk or take the tram, we saw another usher name MARCUS, we ask him how long would the queue roughly takes he answer 'how would i know"", my sister reply what do you mean you don't know you are working here aren't you? he then shouted back with his open arms like a hooligan

We had many delightful visits 1998-2006. We were disappointed at the end of 2017. Tickets purchased weeks in advance resulted in a 45-minute wait to be admitted to be told that it would be another 45-60 minutes to board the tram. We set off on a the crowded walking trails to discover that you could no longer board the tram at other stations. It wasn't possible to see the show because of the crowds. With no reasonable access to the tram, we missed much of the park.
Lesson learned: Don't go to the Night Safari during the holiday season. They don't limit number of people there. The time on your ticket means little. As we entered close to 10 pm, the PA announcement said they were admitting people with 7:15, 8:15 and 9:15 tickets. Frankly, there was no sign the park was focused on visitor enjoyment at any time.

Then we queued for about 30mins to get on a tram, where we were persistently told to be quiet, yet a loud commentary was pretty continuous throughout.

Amazingly we saw every animal that the automated commentary said we would, leading us to question exactly how the animals were so well placed! It all seemed very false and manipulated.

The walking paths were better and it was cool to get close to the wallabies.

It is surprising that they are not using their experience to improve the experience for the visitors.

It starts right at the entrance - preference is given to those who have group bookings - they don't wait in the Q but walk in at their convenience. We bought our tickets directly and had to stand in the Q for almost 45 minutes. The management should understand that non-group booking people also contribute to their profits.

There is one Q for checking the tickets. As you are going in, you are made to wait another 30 minutes. And there is no seating - you are just standing there in multiple lines, while watching the Group booking people stroll in. And finally, there is another wait in Q for scanning your tickets and entering the area. Once you are in, there is another long Q for the tram ride. And it is frustrating as all those group booking people are again ahead of you in the tram Q. We realised that the staff there is more interested in keeping tour operators happy rather than those who come directly / do their own planning.

We went to see Creatures of the Night - a pathetic show put on by the staff. Please don't waste you time on it.

Please factor in another 30 minutes wait before you can board the tram. It was again poorly managed as we saw many trams leaving with empty seats - surprising as there was a long Q. And in many seats, we saw just a couple sitting where as the capacity of a row is 4 people - they could easily fit in 2 couples each and clear the Q faster.

After the tram ride, we did the walk around. We could hardly see any additional animals on the walk around - we saw most of them on the tram ride.

There are 4 walks - sequential - Fishing Cat Trail; Leopard Trail; East Lodge Trail and Wallaby Trail. At the end of the the Leopard Trail, you have the option to board a Tram and return to the starting point.",05-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:56:18.054200

The actual 'safari' takes place on a tram and queuing does not take too long. You are shown a good selection of animals and can see them at close quarters.

Don't be fooled by the good reviews I'm not kidding you. After traveling a half hour to the zoo at 7 we were told that the 7:15 and 8:15 tours were sold out; we were assured by the ticket workers that we would be able to get a seat on the tram after 9:15 when we got in so we bought the tickets for this tour. However, after lining up for 2 hours for the first queue TO JUST GET OUR TICKETS CHECKED, it was another HOUR wait in the line to get on the trams. Can't forget the part where we had a whole family of 20 people push in front of us because one of their family members was waiting in front and the workers did absolutely nothing and let them straight through in front of everyone waiting in line. We opted to go on the walking tracks first then to come back later when the tram line wasn't as long. Coming back from the trail at 10, there was still a 200m line to get on the trams (basically still an hour's wait). Walking past that line, there was yet another 300m line of the people who had bought their tickets for the 10:15 tour who were still waiting to get their tickets checked before they would have to wait with the people still waiting for the tram since 9:15. Furthermore, to anyone considering going on a busy night where you won't be able to get a seat on the tram, the walking tracks are actually not well-lit at all. You can barely see any of the animals in the dark, half are sleeping or just aren't even there. Literally just paying $45 a ticket to look at bloody trees in the dark and to suffer in the heat surrounded by hundreds of people in line for hours. I understand that it's peak season and it gets busy; however it's just not ethical to keep selling tickets to the point where it's overcrowded and there is no way you will be able to cater for everyone who has already bought a ticket for the sole purpose of getting to go on the tram tour without even WARNING them that they might not even be able to make it, because this is something I would've liked to know before my whole family bought the tickets at 7. It's not the money so much as the principle here that they are selling tickets for monetary gain without warning customers of the downright ridiculous wait times after the whole place is packed shoulder to shoulder and there aren't enough trams to put people on PLUS the misinformation we received from various workers. Just writing this as a caution to anyone thinking of going that this is what it could be like if you happened to go on a busy night (not sure how busy other nights are). Waste of money and time but that's just my two cents.
If you need any more proof of this go onto their facebook page and read the recent reviews on there as well.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:56:19.199279

It is very crowded and strongly advised for future visitors to arrive earlier and be prepared for a half an hour queue for the tram ride during peak season. Took a taxi from Chinatown to night safari and it costs me SGD $32 but it only costs me $21 back to Bugis. There was a vehicle broken down on the way there causing a bit of traffic jam but I still felt like a rip off.

A lot of work has gone into creating the experience and the opportunity to see nocturnal animals you might otherwise never see.
We followed the ride with a walk along some of the trails that cover the same territory but which give you a different perspective and allow access to displays not otherwise accessible. Highly recommended.

As a local, i was amused by the place and show event. I am sure tourists would love it too. My best advice, if possible, do enter on their given earliest timing for the evening. So you would not miss out on the show times. Do remember you need some time for the walkabout. If you adventure late, the diners there might be closed when you are about to exit. You will sure go hungry. Plus if you end late, there might not be buses available out. Finally, it is handy to get their map. Enjoy!",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:56:28.704045

We then took the tram tour which had comprehensive and detailed commentary. This part was good. We spent about 2 hours here and could have probably spent more but it was far too busy.

The thunderstorm eased off to a drizzle, but it was still very hard to spot many of the animals. The tram tour was over in about 40 mins, then as the animal shows were cancelled because of the rain, our guide (Grayson) showed us the trails we could walk, as we had time to waste before the bus left 90mins later. The final animal show went ahead, which we enjoyed, the host was lovely and the animals very cute. It was an educational show. The sour point of our night was being abandoned by our tour bus as the animal show ran late and they didn't wait. If that happens to you, there is a shuttle bus outside that you can catch back to near your hotel for $6 each.

Times have changed, tickets prices had grown many times fold. I had a high expectations and for once in a very long time i am surrounded by foreign visitors. However at the end of the day I ended with disappointment and not worth the value I had paid for.
I entered the park with 2 young kids using the concession for locals (15% off). SGD $38 for 1 adult.
There was a light rain and the 7pm tram open slightly earlier than stated.
The kids are so excited to see the animals but ..... it was a disappointed for them.
The tram took about 40 to 45mins around the park. Saw many deers up close , hyenas (cant really see them in a pack), 2 big elephant yes when feeding, lions cannot see hiding inside the mini cave, tiger cannot see, Flamingos yes, giraffe too far away, poor lighted even adults have problem locating the main animals. (I understand it and cant blame the poor lighting because too much light will become an unnatural environment for the animals. There is certainly way for improvement for visibility reasons) Kids were fuming as they cant get to see the main animals. Not mine but others in the tram too. After being in the dark for almost an hour and suddenly seeing so many lights at the alighting station does hurt one's eye especially you had to keep using your eye to search for hidden animals. You will disembark at a shelter for buying photos and the way leading to an animal show.

I would like to highlight safety concern for this animal show. Especially when entering the theater there is only one aisle and this is quite dangerous as there is no crowd control. Some of the foreign visitor do not learn to queue and instead tried to sneak in (pushing their way thru) and cut the queue into the narrow aisle . There is no staff at the entrance of the aisle. accident can happen it some slip or push aanother. i understand there are 3 aisle. But only 1 is used for entering and 3 for exiting.
The creatures of the night show is good and entertaining.
After the show ended the was a 2 way path . We accidentally took the 1 leading out the night safari and thus lost the chance to reenter.

This is a pity. There are many staffs but there presence at main points are lacking. There should be a staff at the exit point advising visitor that it is the exit and they can continue exploring the park by not going out.
I can see why locals are not coming back. High price Low value.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:57:03.034170

First of all the timing is great. SG climate is really humid and during most days it really gets so hot and sweaty! So I enjoy gg outdoors after the sun sets.

Apart from that, the night safari has some really great walking trails and good variety of nocturnal animals. The clouded leopard, tigers, lions, hyenas and sooo many more are all great.

The ""Creatures of the night"" show is great too. Try and queue early though, it tends to get full fast.

Buying a tram tkt is not compulsory but recommended coz it takes a different route compared to the walking route. We get to see the lions, elephants, different kinds of deer, etc really up close. It is a good half hour ride so you get your moneys worth.

They were a bit worried about going to the zoo at night as they thought it would be scary. But when we got there they forgot about being scared and enjoyed watching the animals up close from the tram. They have 3 different timings to enter the zoo the first being at 715pm. We came around 615pm and it was already crowded and there was a long line to enter. We went on the tram ride first and then caught the 830pm creatures of the night show which was very entertaining. We did not go on the walking trails as my sons were tired. Had our dinner at the night safari food was good but so expensive. Overall good experience.,11-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:57:12.366238

You go on a 'train' which wends its way through various areas which contain many nocturnal animals. The lighting is very subtle and does not seem to disturb the animals but they can be seen very clearly. There are some areas where the animals can wander right up to the 'train' but others where you are separated in some way from the animals. A good thing as I don't think I would like a lion wandering right up to me. However, the separation is done in such a way that it is scarcely visible by the onlooker.
At the end of the quite extensive tour, you must go to the 'Creatures of the Night' show. The young lady who leads it has an amazingly bubbly personality, is very funny and introduces an array of nocturnal animals who perform tricks, some with audience participation.

We bought the ticket as part of 4 in 1 package (Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park). In one day we visited Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari (arrived 11.30am, back at the hotel 10pm) . The lady at the Singapore Zoo booked us for 7.15pm time slot for Night Safari.

2 minutes walk from River Safari, 4 minutes walk from Singapore Zoo.
Plenty of restaurants just outside the entrance gate, albeit expensive.
Fiery stunts, Thumbuakar Performance was very entertaining.
Wifi at all parks enable us to get Uber home.

Best to do first was to board the tram, it took us around the park. Then we walked the trails in leisure visiting the animals at different enclosures. A little hard to see as it dark (duh' it's at night!), but lots of staff around to help with crossing roads as there were trams in operation around the park.

Firstly, the only positive aspect. It really is a cool and different way of seeing animals and the habitats are as natural as possible and on the tram ride, you do get quite close to most.

Secondly...the negatives. Our bus (arranged by Night Safari) arrived 20 minutes late. We were then driven to the mainland (we were staying in Sentosa) which took around 40 mins, before being transfered onto a larger bus for the final 40 minute drive to the Night Safari. No one was told that it would be an 80 minute trip with no access to toilets...and being Singapore weather you drink alot of water!

We didn't arrive at the park until around 7.30pm, had to wait while our tickets were found...eventually got into the park at 8.00pm. Followed up by lining up for an hour for the tram. So we finally finish the tram ride at 9.20pm, and have to be back at our return bus by 10pm. Gave us around half an hour to try and look at the walking trails.
Tried to grab a cold drink on the way out ($8 for a small can of coke that was hot, and $12 for a small chips).

Due to the price, and the insane amount of time spent lining up for anything and everything, I highly recommend giving this place a miss.....if you can go on a weeknight it may be a bit easier to get around, but I found it a waste of money and time (we went on a Friday night).",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:57:57.079904

Felt it was a missed opportunity for some sort of entertainment out the front of the zoo while everyone is waiting for so long to get in. When inside, we walked around the zoo because the queue was too long to wait for the safari bus (we were told it would be at least a half hour plus wait). The walk around the zoo itself was interesting and the children delighted in finding all the animals along the way. Amazing how all the animals looked so much bigger at nighttime - particularly the lions. Long stretches of paths with no animals where we weren't sure if we were heading in the right direction - some additional attendants would be useful from a way finding perspective. We did a few unnecessary laps of the same enclosure a few times. Another tedious queue for the show (another 40 minutes) - again another missed opportunity for some entertainment (or education) while everyone waited about in lines. Maybe it was exceptionally busy because it was a Saturday night and perhaps it isn't always that busy. The show itself was interesting although as fabulous as the otters were (they really were lovely), I'm not sure it was worth all the waiting about. Would I go again? Not at night, although I would go again during the day as the Singapore Zoo really is magnificent and world class - just when it's not as crowded.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:57:57.480631

The best thing is that the animals are free to move around and are disciplined.They do not cross their boundaries.
Do check out the Rainforest section to get a chance to be closer to animals and birds.The various shows are amazing ,so have a look at the schedules before hand.
Walking can be tiring,so book a combo ticket having tram ride included in your ticket.However,tram has a restricted route but it will drop u at one of the four stations from where u can walk all the way to different sections.
washrooms and drinking water facility is available at regular intervals.

That saves my family of 7 pax a lot of hassle!

As for transport to the Night Safari, just take a maxi / taxi to and fro, easy peasy. Do not book yourselves through a trace agent, in our case through (SAEX) as the whole transport was late and even though we paid for a to and fro journey ride, we only managed to get to but not return to our hotel. The management of SAEX let other customers into our ride instead. That was the only dissatisfaction we had that night.

We decided to just hang around as the q for the tram is too long to be back by 8. Even though we started queuing before 8pm and were the 4th in the q, the theatre was already 80% full when ushers let us in. Big tour groups simply do not q in the same line and were allowed in whizzing past all of us in the long q! Needless to say all prime view seats were taken when we were finally let in at 825pm. Disappointed that non tour group visitors were penalised for standing in the q early. Plans for the night were set back by more than an hour because we want to catch the show. Eventually we did not get to take the tram too due to the long q. We decided to walk the trail which takes at least an hour to fully complete it without rushing through. By that time, even though there's little q for the tram, kids were too exhausted to continue. So plan your entry super early if you are unable to stay late. I don't know how that's possible since entry is only at 715pm. Perhaps the q to enter at 715 starts way before that! Good luck.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:58:42.588206

first you queue outside, and no one checks what timing you purchsed tickets for, which defeats the purpose of buying tickets per time slot, then you queue inside at the tram station. Trams are 2 bogey units which then slowly take you around with several warnings not to enable flash photo, but still some dumb folks dont get it and continue using flash - the driver then stopped the vehicle and gave an earful. without flash and a moving tram, you cannot get any good photos so enjoy the commentary and the animals. we saw tons of them, pretty much all the animals talked about in commentary.
the show is every 30min i believe so you can do either safari or show first. there is also a walkway trail
things to improve:
1. zoo closes by 5.30/6 and 1st night safari is after 7, they should have some thing for folks who want to do both.
2. pls check the time slot rather than allowing anyone with ticket to enter, this will even out the crowd
3. put some benches on the wait for tram, so elderly and kids can relax while waiting
4. this is not airspace with aircrafts that one tram needs to wait for 5-10 min after previous one, am sure the drivers know how to maintain the distance, so dont let the queued people wait long times in queue or on cart for their turn.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:59:09.682363

Our tram starts at 7.15 or so and we see all tropical animals in artificial moonlight, they are all 10 m to 100 m away from tram and minding their own business which is quite unusual, looks like they are well accustomed to humans. On the way there are guards too on the trail and some told there is a moat in between the animals and the road, but we couldn't see it or verify it. It's quite dark but the animals are in artificial moonlight. There is even a lion here. Other animals are elephants, rhinoceros, hippo, deer, pigs, bison, giraffe etc. There is an audio commentary all through the ride which is very informative. Once the show is over there is a performance at 8.40, so people can either have dinner and join or finish and have dinner. All cuisines are available and the minimum is 15 dollars per person. There is no Mac D or, toast king etc here and hence the food is costly.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:59:10.457553

The nightly shows are overrated but I must give kudos to the trainers and the MCs that try to make it more lively.
Since you are there anyways, just go to the scheduled night show but the unscheduled fire eating dance shows is more dramatic and I wish we spent more time watching.
The safari just consists of a slow night ride inside the forests. You will get glimpses of animals but that is all.
I think it'll be better to just go during the day.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:59:11.195804

The tram ride was really interesting, never saw a white lion before. Here's a tip: try to end up in the middle of the train, it will give you the best and longest view of the animals.

I was almost fainting after standing in the line for over 2 and a half hours and I am not making it up . I had tickets for the 8:15 safari on September 9. They can check the records they don't have enough trams so the line crawls . Staff is rude and shouting at people. Why sell so many tickets to torture people.

Couple of tips:-

- you can get there using the MRT. Cheap but the bus connection is painfully slow and busy. If you have an alternative I would consider that instead

- go as early as you can and book in advance. It gets really busy! Go with your ticket in hand

- consider doing a walk about first then the tram. It gets less busy as the night wears on

- and don't forget the insect repellant

I was kind of disappointed to the animal show though, I do understand that the animals were newbie performers but everything were so awkward that every sequence of the story failed to deliver what they're trying to express to the audiences, good thing the host was doing great in Adlibs and stuff; compared to my last visit way back 2015 the animals were truly magnificent and witty. The crowd, OH MY the crowd.. It felt like you're in ocean of people so patience is necessary. Everyone were shouting here and there. Some employees weren't approachable maybe got so stressed dealing with hard headed guests. Some tip is You should always bring bottled water with you especially traveling with elderly or kids. We waited for our tram ride for about 15-20 mins and everything went smooth then. So happy to see the night side of the jungle. The ride made everything calm and the breeze of the air was cold. You can choose to follow some trails after tram ride too but we tend not to do it since we were traveling with elderly. They have resto outside if you're hungry which was kind of expensive of course so better bring along some snacks with you and have dinner when you're back in the city, or have dinner first then enjoy the night Safari adventure .

He has been to the singapore zoo and so we thought that this would be a newer experience for him. Advice I can offer parents travelling with young children is to purchase the tickets on line and to opt for the first ride which is the 7.15 pm. Saturday's are generally crowded but the lines move fast and you have the facility of using strollers up until the time you get on the tram as well as being entertained by the fire dancers. The actual ride lasts about 20 mins and as we slowly rode through the zoo we saw many different animals from flamingos to deer to hyenas and elephants. A good description about the animals and their habitat was provided throughout the ride and it was quite a fun and educational ride. We opted to travel by taxi and this was faster than using the mrt.,08-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:59:54.633483

I had booked the 7.15pm tixs on line, and gotten to the venue at 7pm.
After 10 mins looking around and asking for directions, we had to wait about 30 mins in line to 'redeem' our booking vouchers.
Then came another 30-45 mins wait to enter the venue. A 15mins fire eating show near the entry provided some respite during the wait.

Once inside, there was an announcement that the 8.30pm 'Creatures of the Night' show was full. We need to come half an hour earlier for either the 9.30pm or 10.30pm performance.

My aunt is 70 years old and my nephew is 4, so the walking trails were out of the questions.
There was a sea of people in front of us in the queue for the tram ride. We suffered an hour and 20 mins wait. It was nearly 9.30pm when we boarded the tram.
It doesn't make sense to wait more than 2.5 hours for a 30-40 mins safari.

My nephew dozed off halfway through the ride. My aunt, tired and hungry, kept muttering that the animals were all very tame.
All six of us sat through the 10.30pm show joylessly, our enthusiasm sapped by the tortuous waiting.

My relatives were clearly disappointed but too polite to complain. Needless to say, I was very embarrassed.

Or
Zoo + river safari

We did zoo + night safari
Zoo is great. Night safari ok but it's a long day if you do both in one day. You queue up to get onto land trains. Each train has about 3 carriages of 20 people approx. We were in the rear carriage, unfortunately it works like this;

'Train' goes to the next stop in front of an animal enclosure, commentary explains what you are looking at. But in some cases at the rear carriage you can't see into the enclosure because you are too far back if you are in the third carriage and you only get a look once the carriage moves off.

There are numerous requests for everyone to keep quiet, but as you can imagine that falls on deaf ears.

It starts with a long queue, like 1 hour to 1 hour and a half just to get your entrance tickets. Then you move to another longer queue to enter the park, around 2 hours. Keep in mind that these queues are in an outside area, so super hot and thousand mosquitos surrounding you all the time to make it even more enjoyable while standing in the middle of a huge crowd of tourists. After entering the park, guess what? Another queue!!! This time for the tram ride. For the price you pay, exploring the park by walking tours must be a real bad joke they try to convince us that is not. So, after these 3 long long long, did I mention long?, queues, the time has come for you to enjoy a night safari on a tram. In one word, disappointing. You spend around 25 minutes to see around 10 different species, looking bored and depressed, with no reactions and totally inactive.
I didn't want to mention this, since most Singaporeans were super nice and friendly towards tourists, in this park it was an exception. Some staff was a little bit rude.

Overall, the night safari is a great experience, but if you can go later in the evening - say from 21.00 onwards - you'll have a far more pleasant time. If you arrive early, you'll face huge queues at the tram station and a long wait to see the excellent Creatures of the Night show. My best advice would be to arrive in time for the 21.30 show, sit on a higher row near an exit and then head for the tram. After the tram ride, you can experience the walking trails. The tram ride is worth doing as it takes you into areas of the park you can't access on the trails. However, it would be good if the driver also gave commentary as the taped commentary on board gets rather wearing and can't respond to any behaviours the animals are displaying during your ride. It's worth taking in the walking trails. The Fishing Cat and Leopard trails were my favourite and showed some animals you don't see from the tram. Walking through the dark jungle, breathing in the night flowering jasmine, and seeing lions awake and active is an experience I will never forget! If you can avoid the pushy crowds, you'll have a wonderful time at this unique attraction. Just one final word of advice - there are no accessible toilets in the tram station, so go to the ones in the restaurant and shopping area before heading to the entry gates, or you will have to exit, then enter again!",08-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:00:03.350287

We had guests in town so decided to organise a trip. I would recommend that you buy tickets online i) to save queuing for tickets and ii) you will normally get a small discount. The first niggle was that it was not possible to buy tickets for locals (which is cheaper) and overseas visitors in the same transaction. We arrived and the queue of people waiting was huge, they stagger the flow of visitors by having different times to start. There is a tram system which goes round where you can see the animals in their native habitat and it is possible to get off at designated points and walk. There is a multi language audio system in front of each seat, which is useful as the guide does all commentary in English. However on the tram we caught it was not working which was a huge disappointment as there were a couple of Chinese speakers in our party who missed out on some of the experience. Talking of the tram the boarding system was somewhat chaotic and I do not remember it being like this previously and wonder whether the Night Safari has become a victim of its own success. One other annoyance was that there were many overseas visitors who did not speak English and the guide was constantly admonishing people for using flashlight on their cameras/phones and the message was not getting across because people did not understand. As it is now so international I feel the safari would benefit from some multi-language signage and/or speakers. The food and beverage is expensive so be warned and the entertainment (fire eaters etc) has not changed in many years, for the first time visitor not such an issue I suppose. To cap it all a lot of animals had decided to take the night off and there was not too much to see, which of course is a risk where there is an element of being as real to a natural environment as possible.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:00:04.797171

At times I thought I was more likely to see a dodo than a tram.
Don't worry about what time you pre book because it bears no resemblance to the actual time you'll eventually get into the safari.
Chuck in a drop of rain, which ensures all the shows are cancelled and it just adds to the utter frustration of standing in the same spot for an hour.
The chances of you actually seeing any animals is pretty remote because by the time you do get in, if the animals aren't asleep, you probably will be !

There should have been a shuttle to pick up walkers who want to make their way back to the main foyer but this was suspended due to the high number of visitors.

If you're coming from the west from countries like England or America then the timing may not be so much of an issue.
lots of food places to chose from so refreshments weren't an issue.

We paid extra for the entrance fee to the safari. We took the first bus to be sure being on the first night safari tram. Arriving to the Zoo it was chaotic. First tram left at 19.00. We were in line from 18.45 and left 19.45 (not fun). When we arrived back after round 30 minutes the night animal show at 20.30 was full and we could not attend the last show being able to catch the transfer back. This took 4-5 hours of our evening for being on a night tram for 30 minutes seeing a few animals in the dark. Sorry but really not worth it. Either you need to go earlier with another transfer to be sure being first in line also being able to se the animal show or maybe better stay in the city and enjoy a great dinner some where.

know how good their queueing system is - especially if it's very crowded. The Night Safari is the complete opposite.
Our tickets were for 9.15pm. By 8.45, the queue was snaking round the courtyard in an uncontrolled fashion with people apparently just joining where they felt like it.
Eventually the snake started to move, then stop, then move, then completely stop for about 15 minutes. Eventually we got to the ticket barrier at about 9.40, to be shown to another queue for the trams that we were told was another hour's wait.
So 9.15 tickets meant getting on a tram at 10.45pm. Ridiculous.

We have to book tickets online and we were not aware that we have to queue before going in as the entry is limited to certain number of tickets in an hourly schedule.
We had to queue for close to an hour before we can go in, by then our young kids were pretty much restless.
However, the experience in there were very awesome. We managed to get pretty up close and personal with the night animals. Signages were visible with guides stationed at every interval so visitors don't get lost.

I went again this time just to give my son the same experience and it had felt like a mistake. It is the park with the same creatures but 7 years' apart, the experience had been just the opposite.

The queue was huge. I mean HUGE. One a weekday, I really had not expected the place to be so much crowded. We had our tickets booked in advance and thus we could only save us from the queue to get the tickets on spot. We had reached half an hour ago and to get in, we had to wait in queue (which was not organized; courtesy: overzealous tourists) without not much space to breathe. It was hot, humid and smelly. Once we got in, we decided to go for the show first and I have to say the quality of the show has deteriorated. We left probably 5-10 minutes before the show ended and then were faced with another HUGE queue to get onto the tram. If we did not have our 8 year old with us, we would have just let the tram tickets get wasted and either had left or tried on foot. I think we waited for nearly 45 minutes before we could get on a tram. I think by then we were too tired to enjoy the ride and the animals.

I don't think I will go back to Nigh Safari ever again. Even my son (who simply loves animals) has not been too ecstatic about it.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:00:23.587378

On the advice from the hotel concierge we arrived 30minutes early. We thought that having pre-bought tickets with the bar code on a phone we would have been scanned and let in for our chosen slot. We couldn't have been more wrong. The entrance of the zoo resembled a unbelievably crowded station with no one having any idea where to be. We were then told we had to queue to pick up paper tickets (???). After 15minutes in one queue to discover we were in the wrong queue. This happened again. Whilst we were waiting in the right queue our slot time had come and gone and we then were told the next slot had sold out. This meant that having got there at 6.45 we had to wait till 9.15 for an available slot.
We decided to wait as the money had already been spent on taxis, tickets etc. Only then to be told that as it had rained we were unlikely to see some of the animals and that we could only go and do 1/3 of the river cruise. When we finally got through at 9.25 to the safari it was again chaotic and we had to push our way through hoards of Chinese who have no sense of queuing etiquette.
The safari itself was good. Only lasted 40minutes and I'm not sure it was worth the 3hour wait.
For a country that prides itself on technology I can't help feeling that the system can be made easier, more straight forward with less waiting if bar codes and scanners were used more effectively. Also if there were clear signs to tell people what to do/where to queue etc. We had to wait while it was raining in the food court which wasn't bad, but again disorganised.

The park have really thought this through in relation to the treatment of the animals and the visitors experience. The night trails you can do before or after the tram ride are simply amazing to be able to get that close to such beautiful animals without impacting them too much is amazing.

The only negative is the 45 minutes plus waiting in queues to get onto the tram... but I don't know how else the park could make that better when you consider the volume of guests they are trying to process through the park.

We tried to catch the tram halfway at point 2 and 3 and 4 but as no one got off..we then had to walk all the way back to find yet another hour long queue.

I'm seeing recent reviews of people getting there without a ticket and being angry that they didn't get one. You've got two options, either be there hours before, like 5PM (I personally have not tried this) to purchase a ticket (not recommended) or PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE. Cannot stress that enough. There's a huge crowd even on weeknights! (went there on a Wednesday evening), and the place was packed, the queue was insane! We got on the tram for 8:10 (not sure what time it starts, but there's 3 schedules, 7, 8 and 9) I got the 8PM one to be safe, and accidentally arrived there at 6PM. LOL!

The staff by the gate did not allow queuing for 8PM yet, and they said we could be back by 7:45. We ate at the restaurant on the left side ( I forgot the name), I strongly recommend you get the whipped/mashed potato with chicken gravy, it's sooo good. Tip: You might see the coke overpriced, it's because it comes with a cool container :) I think it's worth it haha

I started to see people queue by 7:30 so I went in and the staff allowed me to. The queue is long, but to my surprise it's kinda moving? Well, each tram takes a lot of people after all, so yeah. There's two places to queue, the one you get in, and the one across, I felt so excited when they allowed us (we were first in line) to cross, only to be disappointed that they actually made us wait for around 6 more rounds (dont know how much time I waited) so if you can, stay on the first queue and don't go across (I may need an explanation as to what happened there. I got so pissed because while we were on the other side, the people BEHIND US, like WAAAAY behind us, got on the tram faster than we did WTF!!!! Because they stayed on the original side (mind you, we did not cross because we were impatient, we only crossed to the other side because the staff told us to) Really pissed at that point, and I'm pretty sure everyone on my side was too! The staff didn't even bother explaining why we had to wait, and the other side already had 6 rounds of tram!!! so annoying! I took one rating because of that experience, a good explanation would have stopped all of us from being pissed.

Anyways, the great part is that the animals are out and about during the tram ride.
Please don't use flash photography, it annoys the animals, the staff and the other passengers who get scolded by the staff because of the inconsiderate person.
Some parts smell like poop (well it is a zoo after all). Prepare to walk, wear comfy walking shoes.

Family tickets for 2 adults and 2 young children came to SGD 113 for ""flexible tickets"". So it was definitely cheaper than going direct through the official website. The ""flexible tickets"" allows you to enter at any of the set times (7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm and 10pm). However, this does not guarantee that you will get in at any of the entry times with a ""flexible ticket"" as they can sell out. I arrived at 8.15pm and was told that it was sold out but could only enter at 9.15pm. I asked the ticket desk if I had booked for a 7.15pm entry and missed the entry time then could I get into the 8.15pm time slot? Yes. So, in future, buy a 7.15pm ticket online and if you miss the entry time you can still get in for the later entry times. Does not make sense, but that's how it works!

In terms of concept and what was available to see it ranks quite high. However, it was way overcrowded for 7:15 entry.

Hugely disappointed at the crowds and management. Great to see the animals at night though albeit we saw many during the day at the main zoo! We ended up leaving much earlier than intended due to the crowds and a fair distance back into town. expect S$35 taxi.

My daughter who is scared of the mere mention of the word Lion or Tiger wanted to check out the nocturnal animals. The Night Safari do an amazing job and this tour starts off in a tram and brings you close to nature as you tour the park and listen to an audio guide explain each safari resident. It's impressive how discreetly the enclosures are built because it's easy to imagine the asiatic bear or hyenas simply climbing out of their enclosures. Some animals are free to roam and end up inches away as they lounge beside the tram route.

Off the tram is the highlight for me and you can spend hours here once you get off tram and take the extensive footpath routes through the safari. If you don't do the walk the tram tour will be over in 30 or so minutes and the trip wouldn't be worth it IMHO.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:00:59.809195

The animal show is well done, but frankly not that interesting. The MC and animal trainers did a very nice job and kept things moving, but in the end I wasn't entertained. Neither was my father (78), but my daughter (13) did say it was nice.

TIP: if you go to the animal show sit near the aisle toward the top so that you can make a quick escape at the end and stay ahead of the crowd headed to the trams. We made a rookie mistake and sat low and in the center, which was great for viewing the show but left us at the end of a very long line when we left for the trams. The venue is small and you can enjoy the show just as well from the top as the bottom. I promise!

NOTE: It's hard to see the animals at night. This makes all the sense in the world, but didn't dawn on me until we were already $150 and 3 hours in the hole. It you really want to see the animals the day-time zoo experience may be your best bet. You can sorta see the animals from the tram, but not to my satisfaction.

Suggest you go straight into the Creatures of the Night show first as the show is only every hour, so as more people come in later it is more difficult to get a seat. Being from Australia we decided to skip the Wallaby Trail, and walked through the Fishing Cat Trail and the Leopard Trail. You see a lot more walking these ones and the walk at night is really nice. We then caught the Tram from Station 3 as animals on East Lodge Trail are easier to see, plus you can't see Elephants, Rhinos, Wolf unless you go by tram. Whole thing was a really great experience. Easier to get a taxi to & from Clarke Quay than any other transport option. Only $30 each way.

As soon as my kids saw the mouse deer (the first exhibit on the Fishing Cat Trail) in the undergrowth, they were hooked. The novelty of seeing animals at night is obviously the reason for the Night Safari's longevity. It's just unusual and therefore fun. In some cases your view of an animal is not as good as at a conventional day zoo; in other cases, it is much better. And in some cases you can't see the animal in a particular cage at all, but that's also true at a day zoo. Everyone has their own opinion, but ours was that the walking trails offer the best way to see the zoo, being quieter and far less crowded than the tram and giving you the chance to spend as much or as little time at each exhibit as you want. True, the walking trails do not offer access to a few of the animals that can be viewed on the tram, but those are few in number. Much of the Fishing Cat and Leopard Trails, meanwhile, are only accessible via the trails.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:01:25.536859

You can then take a tram around the night safari to get a good view of all animals. All animals are same as you would have seen in zoo but the night ambience makes it different and interesting

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/shmj,494728559,21-06-2017,2,Extremely Poor Service.,"The Night Safari itself is overall properly maintained.
But there are quite a few exhibit closure due to their upgrading works.

The Tram stations (especially the one at the entrance) has a super long queue and irritable, rude staff. We decided to skip the wait since it seemed like its going to be a long one...

While walking along the paths, some of the areas can be a tad dark and I have a young child who is afraid, my husband switch on the ""torchlight"" function on the phone and let her shine it on the pavement so to calm her down a bit.
However, after walking for less the 3 minutes, a guy (who later showed us his staff pass) happened to walk past us and very rudely say ""NO TORCH LIGHTS. NO LIGHTS!"" We explained saying that there is no animal exhibits around and that my child is scared of the dark, she is only shining it on the pavement and no where else. However, this guy just answered us in a pompous manner and showed his pass. Then again said - ""NO LIGHTS IN THE ZOO!"" While there were signs indicating no flash lights when taking photography, we did not spot any signs saying that we can shine lights on the floor/ pavements.

This episode kind spoil our outing since we have already seen the irritable staff behaviour (directed at some of the visitors trying to board the tram) at the zoo's entrance.

Then, after much walking, we decided to wait for the tram anyways at a random station stop near the Bear areas... Again, the staff manning this station was extremely rude. There were another small group of tourists who rushed forward when the tram was approaching... This Staff then shouted at the tourists asking them to queue up. Now, there is nothing wrong with the staff asking these people to queue up since everyone else is doing the same. Its the approach that leaves others wondering whether the Service Staff are all these rude?

We have encountered 3 different staff and all 3 seemed to behave as if they own the zoo, extremely rude and in a rather pompous manner.

The overall impression that we have of the Night Safari is such that the staff are not trained to speak properly and nicely to visitors. The only way they communicate is by shouting.

We can't believe that we sighted 90 percent of the animals there. With a little homework I think it will help make the time more enjoyable.

1. Check the websites for discounts. There are slightly more discounts for tourist. Found this provider called govoyagin, their prices are better for tourists. For locals, on different days, there are discounts extended provided an NRIC number is being keyed in. So we picked a day where we get the maximum discount. For an adult and a kid, we paid $63.75.

2. Check the weather, I think if it were to rain, the walking bit will definitely be affected. Bring along a little fan and water, it will definitely make things a little more pleasant and save some money.

3. Be ready to walk. The 4 trails have signages all neatly and clearly marked out. It was not as long as we thought it will be. And all the animals on the map are at their right places. As compared to several years ago, Night Safari has definitely improved in terms of its walking trails, the recorded commentary in the tram and crowd management. The sighting of the animals became a little game for us, we stood still and waited for the animals to move. It was fun and the animals were amazingly beautiful.

I think some of the unpleasant comments made were targeted at some poor tourist behaviors and ill preparedness rather than the service provider. Yes queues were long but if the staff have tried to manage as best as they could and people are still pushing and shoving about, some tourists were even seen removing barricades by themselves, then it's the tourists issue in my opinion.

We went there at about 6 pm rather than 7:15 pm, the stipulated opening hour, after reading other tourists' inputs. We got to shop around a little, and get the map. Went for the animal show first, which we queue for about 20 mins. They tried to fill as many people in the area as possible, so it's not difficult to get a seat. After the show, we walked all the 4 trails by around 9 pm. Came back to the start point and hopped on to a tram, which by then was cleared of the long queues. The tram ride of about 40 mins was pleasant and we got to see animals which are not on the same route as the walking trails. The commentary on the tram was clear and informative, a great improvement from the first time I came. Price wise, it is a tad expensive as compared to some other zoos in the region, however the quality of the visit is one of my most enjoyable.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:01:45.793575

Very disappointed.","I have visited the Night Safari a few times over the years and although I very much wished to rate it 5* (as anticipated) I regret the destination deserves no more than 1*, rated so low due entirely to extremely high crowding of the whole facility, and very poor line logistics to enter the night zoo. I also have safety concerns of the facility due to the above reasons (covered at the end).

We arrived at about 7pm, with pre-purchased tickets, to realize that we had to join the long line to exchange our pre-bought tickets for other tickets. I purchased the tickets off-site to avoid the initial sales lines, and the ticket redemption line was 4x as long as the ticket line. Ironically, there was even a sign at the counter saying ""skip the lines, buy ahead"".

Next, we wanted to enter at about 7pm only to find that the attraction is SO OVERCROWDED that they now have 4 entry points per night, and 7:15pm was full, so we then had to wait to 8:15pm. Ok, it happens, but on top of that, it took more than 30-40 minutes for the 8:15pm entry ticket line to clear so 815 wasn't 815 but closer to 9 actually.

It started to sprinkle with light rain, so the young staff closed two of the ~5 lines to get in, pushing us under a roof to avoid the lane. What really infuriated me was that these 2 lines were merged into one ""holding line"" where we basically had to wait for absolutely everyone else in lines 1-3 to clear - and - the lines 1-3 continued to fill behind us so we were just waiting and people who joined the line long after us were let through first.

The very junior (ie young) staff were totally unable to manage the crowds- not their fault as they are young, but the systems / processes in place totally let us (the customers) down, as the staff. Not a supervisor was visible all night.
Allowing crowd control systems like this to continue in what must be a known problem is completely the responsibility of the management of the attraction, and they should be held accountable to fix it. Off to the right of our line, other staff were letting other guests through a side gate which further caused equity issues. I get it that it is hand to manage people and crowds, but, these are 100% predictable and have to happen almost every night. This is totally unacceptable, Night Safari Management.

I had also purchased the tram tickets, but on entry, found out that the line to just get on the tram was more than 45 minutes long.

The park was so crowded, with small/narrow trails that even when in the park, it crawled at a snails pace. It was like one long line through most of the park, with 30% of people moving backwards on the trails which further added to frustration of the night.

The food, drinks on site are very overpriced as well.

I love attractions in Singapore. I've been to many (I have lived here for 20 years) but something has to be done for this destination to make it appealing. We had a horrible experience due to the crowds / systems in place. The animals were nice, but unfortunately this could not overcome the frustrations of overcrowding.

In my opinion, the overcrowding situation as witnessed at 7-8-9pm+ last night puts the destination at risk and management in negligence should there be an emergency and crowds need to be evacuated. This destination was unsafe due to the crowds and systems / crowds need to be immediately looked at if even from this perspective, if assuming participant satisfaction isn't a factor.

I would recommend going to the zoo or bird park instead. Also busy, but much more enjoyable and better managed.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:01:52.710774

I went because of my niece who had never been and the whole world is there. What a crowd!
Tip #1: If you are a tourist, consider joining a tour group to the Night Safari as you will not need to queue with the rest of the world for the tram ride. Quite worth it as it includes the ticket and the transport to/fro the hotel. Imagine having to wait with the same crowd for public transport to get out of the remote place.
Tip #2:If joining a tour group is a no-no, then you can consider doing a walking trial first and then hop on the tram ride at the Leopard Trail, not much of a queue there as most visitors refused to walk at Night Safari and I don't know why.
Tip #3: The ticket entry time does not mean you must enter by 7.15 or 8.15pm. So one still going after that entry time and still get to enter. Again, I don't know why but the whole world turned up at the exact entry time for each time slot. They will still let you know at 7.30, 7.45, 8.30, 8.39, 8.41pm.
Tip #4: about the show, which is always full every night, it is best to leave it to the end of everything or send someone ahead to queue. By the way, once entered, there's no time limit when one must leave. Can stay till the zoo closes.
Tip#5: It is advisable to buy the ticket online as the 7.15 and 8.15 are often sold out.

Paying extra $10/person for the priority quene for the tram ride is not nearly as worth it in my opinion as still have to queue.

It is completely over hyped and over rated. The transport from the centre of the city to the venue is slick. Arriving at the centre, with pre booked tickets and with a specific departure time, we were told the departure time was full and we would have to wait to the next one (over an hour later) but when I kicked off that these were my tickets and constituted a contract, and that they would be in breach of contract, they suddenly found us 2 places. We were then herded along a zig zag line for over 45 minutes. If it had not been for a super couple from Vietnam who engaged us in conversation, it would have seemed much longer. The electric truck pulling seated trailers pulled up and we were told no flash photography as it spooks the animals (fair enough) but it is so dark that no camera I know of would work in such conditions. The commentary is mundane, and I have no desire to see deer and antelope I can see anytime. The virtual moonlight is ok if you happen to be an owl, but I hardly saw a thing. The tour took just over 30 minutes. I timed it. I had been herded longer in the queue at the beginning. When the truck stopped and we were instructed to leave our seats, I said in a loud voice: ""Is that it?"" It was a complete con. Very, very poor. I cannot state how disappointing it was. A complete waste of an evening. There was a satisfaction form which we took time to complete. We were shown a box to post it in. I suspect that there was a black bin liner underneath, so I handed it to a worker on the Information Desk, and told her to read it and put it in the ""Suggestion Box"" herself, as I do not believe anyone would care what I wrote. The staff were arrogant and unfriendly. It was the worst and the most disappointing thing I did in 4 months of travel around the world.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:01:53.826147

They have many animals - their habitat highlighted with strategic light so that we may gave easy viewing. And it is really a safari - some of the animals are really close to the tram. There is no enclosure! However the ferocious ones are kept far at a distance. You may also choose to walk to view more animals and continue back your ride in the tram.

My only complaint is that the queues for the tram were so long. We decided to start with the walking trail to avoid the queues and that was amazing (and quiet as everyone else seemed to only want the tram). We saw plenty and although tired from a whole day at the zoo there was so much to see that we got a boost of energy. We decided we wouldn't bother with the tram but then realized that there is a whole section that can be accessed by the tram only. Once we had completed the walking trails and had been to the show we returned to the tram queue only to find it was just as bad as it had been at the beginning.

It is very well organized. It's good to start early and catch the firemen in action. Also catch the first creatures of the night show. The flying fox enclosure and nakamurra cave within the complex are highlights of the trail. You may even bump into animals at an arms distance during your walkabout.
If you are a visitor I would recommend the parkhopper ticket and finishing all 3 attractions - zoo, river safari and night safari in the same day - preferably a weekday when the queues will be shorter. Start with the zoo, cover the morning shows followed by the afternoon feeding trail - don't miss the rhino, giraffe feeding which the kids love. Move onto river safari after a quick lunch for walkabout seeing the pandas and doing the amazon ride. Have an early dinner and do the fire show along with the first show for creatures of the night.

This is one of the worst in Singapore. If you are on a tight sched and budget..it is best to avoid this.

Time duration- The Zoo advertises the night safari to open at 7:30 to 12pm but never did any ad medium here mention that to actually gain entrance by 7:30 sharp in order to enjoy the park, you have to be here by 5:00!! Yes almost 3 hours earlier.

And that is because of the stupid and inefficient park processing of guests. Imagine we bought already tickets online, and it has a bar code similar to Universal Studios..so supposedly, assuming the usual efficiency of SG, we assumed that we would be let in as soon as we got there which was around 7:15pm. But to our frustration, we were made to line up to process e tickets where it was manned by only 2! persons who were taking their slow sweet time time processing us. All in all, we were issued NEW tickets around 9:pm!!! And then the lines for the actual entrance were so long..we gained entry a little past 10pm already! Talk about wasted time. This park is the highlight of SG stupidity.

With no time to try out the walking trails and we were too tired due to our long wait standing up..we were left with the option of the tram ride. It was ok and a nice experience but was ruined by the ride drivers Impatience!! As we were passing by different animal locations..we practically have no time enjoying the scene as by then after he points at the animals..he just basically passes thru and never stops even for just a minute.

I went there with my family and it was a fun outing. There's an animal show before the main touring begins, which should be more attractive for the younger generation. Visitors are shown around the park in battery powered trains. Walking trails are also available. The animals themselves are quite varied and interesting to see at night. (A common lizard jumped on my head and sped off!) Points to remember: avoid rainy nights as the animals will mostly be in shelters. The trains are wheelchair friendly.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Rajib_Deysarkar,478104852,23-04-2017,4,A Zoo with an unique night life experience,"Though one of the most popular Zoos of Singapore (not an easy task in a city-state which boasts of some of the world's finest animal enclosures) and does provide an altogether different kind of night-life-in-the-zoo experience, but the time you can spend in the zoo is quite limited (4 to 5 hours at maximum) and it is quite difficult to walk through all the trails to visit each and every animal enclosure. If you are also very enthusiastic about taking photographs of animals in a zoo, obviously this is not the right place, unless you've a very powerful prime lens, you won't be able to take good photographs of the animals in the dark. And of course you shouldn't use the flash.

Having said the above, if you are looking for a unique zoo experience at night and want to see some nocturnal animals which would only come out after dark, ""Night Safari"" is a good opportunity to do that.

Before you enter the safari, right at the entrance courtyard you can watch the ""Thumbuakar Performance"" which is very entertaining, mainly you've kids with you they will love it or if you've never seen the fire blowing tricks. Check out the timings, which are likely to be at 6:45 pm, 8 pm, 9 pm & 10 pm.

Once you enter the zoo, I would recommend you to hop on to the zoo trams as there is lot to cover and riding on the trams do gives opportunity to cover a lot. As chances of taking very good photographs are remote, it would rather make sense to see as much as you can. And also you can hop off and hop on to the tram any number of times from number of junctions. This gave us the opportunity to see some animals in our second ride which we couldn't see in the first ride. Some of the animals which we saw while on the tram rides were like ""Bharal"", ""Barsingha"", ""Stripped Hyena"", ""Asiatic Lion"", ""Giraffe"", ""African White Lion"", ""Barteng"", ""Malayan Tapir"", ""Red Dhole"", ""Asian Elephant"", ""Sambhar Deer"", ""Indian Wolf"", ""Asian Rhinocerous"", ""Thamin"", ""Gaur"", ""Asiatic Black Bear"", ""Ankole Cattle"" and the ""Malayan Tiger"".

After you've taken at least one tram ride, then you can start taking the walking trails. Unfortunately for us as we were running out of time we couldn't take all the trails. We were just able to take the ""Wallaby Trail"" and ""East Lodge Trail"" and watch animals like ""Wallaby"", ""Baboon Tarantula"", ""White Lipped Python"", ""Babirusa"", ""Red River Hog"", the rare ""Bongo"", ""Spotted Hyena"", ""Serval"" and the ""Sloth Bear"" quite closely.

Also we opted to see the ""Creatures of the Night Show"". Looking back at it, unless you are really enthusiastic about animal game shows, you can surely skip this, you aren't going to miss much and it will save you a lot of time. The show takes a lot of time to get started, to allow the audience to settle down and then it is nothing extra ordinary. If we'd have skipped the show, we could have probably cover more of the walking trails. However if you've kids with you, then might enjoy the show.

Overall ""Night Safari"" gives a different kind of zoo experience, which is why it is worth a visit. Those who intends to take buses/taxis to get back to your respective destination, I think you can be rest assured that late buses/taxis are available.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:02:47.513665

however once you get in you have to wait for your number the coaches arrive and then there is plenty of space in coaches they make sure that everyone gets a seat and then the safari begins all the animals can be spotted easily.

However there are many practical issues like lighting,proximity to the animals,safety etc. that need careful attention . The management has tried addressing all these issue in the best manner possible and have done a good job .

With low key lighting the visibility is limited and there is nothing much one can see with any clarity . However the thrill of being in the presence of wild life in their domain was exciting.

The commentary was good,informative and presented well but as expected the lighting was low key. Admirable for the animals and a strain on the human eyes.

During the tram ride one may hop off at certain stations to take a walk in the jungle. We continued with the tram ride because we had come here as a family with members of different age groups.Able bodies individuals would find the walk more exciting than just the tram ride.

We had a very short wait period when we entered the place at opening time but as we were leaving I noticed there was a surging crowd and a long queue at the entrance. Turn up early to avoid waiting in long queues

Pros
A) Animals condition are waayyy much better then where I come from. They look active and yes like animals... some commented that few animals cannot be seen but hey... its nocturnal anyway so some you see and some you don't. So for me its fine as my kids got to see lions and tigers enjoying their dinner. Thats a plus
B) Crowd control was fantastic . We went for 815pm ride and the crowds was building up. Ut kudos to night safari team although its a fair bit of waiting but you do see they have a system in place. Cant blame them since its a tourist place

Cons
A) We went for a trail walk and finally got lost inside whereas its 10pm... searched for a tram to ride back but theres none. Luckily kids are still active and dont mind the walk. So point to note always be aware of the walking you're doing if its trail walk

I gave it a three star since once we're done with the tram n trail walk. Nothing much to be done. The show for animals also finished quite fast so if have multiple shows will be great to accommodate late comers",03-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:03:33.088050

The tram ride was also very convenience for those that don't like to walk in the hot humid climate in singapore. It also convenience for seniors that has challenge with mobility.

During my visit, the weather was about 24-27 deg C, and a little drizzling. Actually, its another kind of experience to visit this place while drizzling. Maybe drizzle makes animals more active.

Look the rating of the attraction is harsh because there has been a massive effort in setting up what appears to be on the surface a fantastic wildlife park for the animals..

Where this place is so horrible is organisation.

We've three kids under 7 so as you can imagine its not easy controlling these little buggers at the best of times however the park needs to accommodate families.

Entry Queue - put it mildly I was angry.. My son got pushed over by an Indian tour group whom thought they had the right to push through. Who pushes a 5 year old over to then just ignore his crying... after 10 mins of comforting him we re-joined the queen only to then be faced with massive wait times.

Tour Busses - You'd think that the staff would ensure the busses are full and every seat taken, nope. There is room for 4 on each bench seat, some left with only 2 on a seat.. that meant more times in the queue for us.

Staff - I asked three staff members for assistance when my boy got bowled over.. not one helped. Then when asking for guidance I may have as well asked one of the animals...

Needless to say all three of my boys fell asleep before the tour started, then we had some rude person decide that talking on the tour was a fantastic idea..

Honestly I cannot recommend this place... Even when I complained after the event I was given some BS response effectively denying the organisation was bad.

This place needs a family queue say 40 mins before the main entry opens with a kids only policy (say for those under 5).

You've two options a. head to one of the other wildlife parks b. pay a little extra and get yourself a VIP pass, you bypass the queues...",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:03:43.220498

But when you are admitted into the Night Safari, DO NOT join the tram queue. Ignore the tram for the time being.
Instead, turn left towards the Fishing Cat Trail.
Enjoy enclosure upon enclosure of animals frolicking in the dark. It is such a treat for animal lovers like us!

Follow the trails all the way around the Night Safari. There is Leopard Trail and some others that I forgot the names.
This gentle hike (prams/stroller should be able to work your way around as well) might take about 2 hours leisurely. But our family took about 3 hours. Plus a little rest in the overpriced yoghurt place in the middle of the trails.

The setting is very dark so the animals happily go out to check the snacks the zookeepers left for them in every enclosure. We enjoyed observing each of them up close!
Only the flying squirrels did not show up because we were perhaps very late in visiting them already.

At the end of the trails we arrive back at the entrance of the Night Safari. So we can board the tram immediately. No queue!
And we were the only ones on the tram. It was like a private tour!!

Received an instant email with e-tickets to print off or leave on your phone. There are other sites offering bigger discounts but I believe you had to queue up & redeem your voucher on arrival for these. As we were staying in Orchard Rd, we took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station, this took 30 minutes (mostly standing room only)at 5.45pm. On arrival at Ang Mo Kio, walk to the underpass to the bus station & catch the 138 to the Singapore Night Safari. It cost $2.20 each, ideally have the correct money as no change is given. Our trip took 40 minutes on the bus but it was rush hour. To be honest I think this was the furthest the bus went but you couldn't miss your stop. Arrived at the Safari & the queue was long but moved very quickly. We did the 4 walking trails first, each trail took around 20 minutes each to walk. Then we caught the tram ride which is 40 minutes long. This way if your legs are tired you get a rest! There was a much smaller queue for the tram, as everyone seemed to do the tram first. Doing the walking trails and the tram allows you to see all the animals from different sides. We didn't see either show but I am sure they would have been great. We caught the 138 back to Ang Mo Kio station which took 25 minutes. Don't forget the MRT stops running at 11.30pm. If you get stuck and you miss your bus to the MRT we were informed by the park there are other buses that will take you back to the city for $6 each and they left as late as midnight to most hotels in the city (list was at information desk). It had rained all day so we were skeptical whether it would be any good but it added to the atmosphere. It had actually stopped raining when we got there. We really enjoyed this attraction. We saw all the animals except the Leopards. We didn't eat & drink as we took a few bottles of water & had eaten before we went.

It really adds such a totally different dimension to see the animals in the dark. The tram tour was amazing, although it does mean that you might miss some of the animals if they don't happen to be out and about at the time you go past and you can't walk back to see all of them (for example, the hippos were hiding and you can't go back to see them and the white lions were hiding but those you can walk back and view from a platform)
The cage-free enclosures really make this experience special. It was actually a little unnerving to walk past the hyenas as they stood slightly above you looking out into the dark!
It was really great to see some more unusual animals like the slow loris and the pangolin. The show is also fantastic.
It's a great day out done in combination with the river safari which is right next door and only requires a few hours to walk around. You could visit the river safari from 2 or 3pm onwards and then go straight into night safari at 7pm with time to grab some food in between. (Night Safari has timed entry points which are like 7pm, 8pm & 9pm so you need to bear this in mind if trying to do both in one day otherwise you could be waiting around a lot in the middle). I wouldn't suggest visiting the zoo & night safari on the same day (the zoo is also right next door) as the zoo is so massive and takes all day to get around that I think you'd be too tired to enjoy the night safari properly if you did them both on the same day.",02-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:04:00.118907

On the night that we went all of the animals were out in their habitats. It had poured rain all afternoon but we took the chance and went and there was just a very light sprinkle, which probably helped bring out the animals. There are very few fences here, mostly moats to keep the animals in a specific area. There were lots of big cats and many other animals. You can walk or take a tram. If you wait for the tram (double bus) you can ride through most of the trails and you get an excellent view of the animals. You can also walk, which would be very exciting, as it is dark and you are walking in between the enclosures. The tram line moved quite quickly. We were at the end of the marked off zig zag line and it took about 20 minutes to get to the tram.

The Good. As with all Singapore attractions it's very well packaged and polished. Good food selections, a good vibe and neat and tidy. There's enough to do to keep you interested for an hour or two. You will (may) see some animals within 4 - 5 metres or so. Staff, for the most part, are friendly and helpful.

The Bad. It's dark. Ok so there are special lights that allow you to see... well kind of... but it's not like seeing animals during sunlight hours at your own pace. Just about every animal on the tour you can see just fine in most other zoos during the day. As with all Tourist traps like this, you are simply a number hearded like cattle through the attractions... and exit past the gift shops. The tram whizzes by every enclosure so that only a glimpse is possible and thus no real time to have a good look.

It's worth mentioning that the zoo is about 30min in a charter bus or taxi from the city area.

We saw one male lion and some Elephants at close range, but many others were elusive. You may see some deer, a bear or two, a peek at a tiger, some cattle, hyenas, rhinos, flamingos and the seemingly obligatory zebra / giraffe enclosure. It's rushed, rather dull and... err... dark.

It's a tourist trap... pure and simple. For those who love animals, or really enjoy the packaged, ""off the shelf"" type tour may find some value here. I did not. Even my young animal loving daughter thought it was just ok.

Our reason for electing to do this tour was the overwhelmingly positive reviews from all and sundry on TripAdvisor and other similar sites. I did the tour with my husband and 2 (nearing 3) year old daughter.

So, I'll begin with the positives:
1. We booked ""jump the queue"" style tickets meaning we were ushered through the gates with no wait for the 'safari tram'
2. Prior to the zoo we were picked up from our hotel ahead of time by a minibus operator.
3. The tour was well organised and good information provided before arrival at the zoo.
4. Exhibits were very well presented.

And now for the negatives:
1. If you intend to go with young children please be aware that from your pickup point to the safari may we'll be up to 2 hours...
2. The tour doesn't begin its laborious return until 10pm. We opted for a taxi back earlier.
3. Don't expect any photos. It will be dark before you begin and flash photos are not allowed.
4. The night tour doesn't guarantee a glimpse of all animals. Some are still asleep/ hiding.
5. The safari tram moved at a fairly rapid pace. Blink and you might miss it!

Suggestions:
1. Eat before you go. No food is allowed on the safari ( as the animals may get ideas apparently)
2. Take mosquito repellent
3. Take a pram as there are a number of night time walk opportunities and as these will likely begin after your tram ride it will be late ie 9pm or after (zoo is open until midnight)
4. Go for the daytime zoo experience. You will still likely see just as many animals, if not more.

However all in all it was a good experience. My suggestion would be that value would be maximised for families with kids 4+ who have a little more staying power and still I'd argue that a daytime zoo visit might be a better option for a day trip!",02-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:04:01.571333

They might have promotions like 25% discount for online booking and special catering for those who wants to have a VIP experience, you can find a contact on the website.

There's entry time to the safari. its at 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm. Its always best to reach there early to get your tickets on time. Its usually crowded on the weekends and you might not be able to get the time slot that you want.

For a start, once you have gather at the assembly area, when they open up the ropes to queue for the entry lanes, take the one on the left, you will be able to get a clear view of the thumbuakar show. The show will start at 7pm, 8pm, 9pm. So while you are queuing at the entry lanes, you will be watching the show. Once the show end, the entry gates will be open.

Secondly, head on in to the safari, make your way to right, rush for the amphitheatre. Try to get seated in the middle section where you will be able to get a clear view of everything during the show. No flash photography is allowed during the show. It's a good 30 minutes and worth the watch. Once the show end, do not make your way out yet, you will be able to get a photo session with the animals.

Thirdly, you can choose to go for a walk along the trails or the tram ride, but i will advise to go for the walk first, once you're tired walking, sitting down on the tram will help to heal the aches. LOL.

Things to take note while along the trails, it could be pitch dark at certain areas and do not expect to be able to see all of the animals along the way. Some animals are only able to view if you go for the trails therefore its a must not to miss it.

Once you are back at where u started from, take the tram. Rest those legs while they bring you around the park to see the animals. You will be wondering why go around and see the animals again. Just like the trails, when taking the tram, you'll be able to see other animals which you will not be able to while on the trails. Especially the white lion.

Pointers :

Not all shops accepts nets / mastercard / visa so do have some spare cash with you at all times.

The Gift Shops are located at the entrance of the safari, therefore you can settle for it once you're done with everything before exiting the park.

Do carry a bottle of water with you, it could get pretty stuffy in the trails.

Standby your grabcar and uber app. You will need it for your way back. Taxis are kind of hard to get especially at night. The park is closed at 12 midnight. And using grabcar or uber will help you to avoid those midnight charges from the taxis.

The long line started at least an hour before the first ride and that too there were several hundred people ahead of us. It was a terrible wait and the line never seemed to end.
The ride itself is expensive and ultra boring. definitely not worth the amount of the ticket. Half the animals couldn't be seen as the animals were at a distance some were not visible. This was very disappointing. Definitely not recommended.

The only saving grace was the animal show which was somewhat entertaining but that too was a bit of a drag. This is a complete waste of money. Not worth the hype created by visuals and advertisements.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:04:17.199822

There was an extra element of excitement because it was dark and we were warned to not touch the free-range animals approaching the tram. The dinner was good and the whole place clean and well-taken care of. Had the feeling though of too many people and extreme commercialism.

We used TourEast and even though the transfer was fine, the busses were old and many of the seats broken.

Luckily we hold an annual pass for the park and along with online booking, we were able to bypass most of the crowds queuing for entrance.
We skipped the show on this occasion and fixed on the 45 minute train drive with audio guide.
With young children, this is as easy as it gets - sitting comfortably and watching the animals with delight.
*Tip - don't sit at the front of the wagon with the window as this actually hinders your view.

The animals and birds (lots of flamingos!) were delightful to watch - and what a variety throughout the 45 minute journey.

If you're considering doing this trip one evening but are hesitant because you have young kids with you - I suggest you get there early, Skip the show and get on one of the first trains.

We had a quick bite to eat afterwards at a burger place which was nice enough although I'm not sure I'd go back again.

Book ahead the tickets for the night safari or else you will end up standing in the line for over 30 minutes.
The entrance to the night safari at your designated time involves u to wait for another 60 minutes.
After that u have to run to pick what u want to do and some attractions like the bird show which was not that good but they closed due to space limitations.
so plan ahead what u want to see in the night safari.

The river walk is not very impressive, long walk, no proper directions and nothing very interesting to see.
several aquariums etc in united sates are much better,so this did not appeal much.

Finding a cab after the show was a nightmare with kids who were tired, however the ZOO officials were helping out the tourists in every way possible to find a conveyance.

Because we wanted to skip the long lines at the ticket box we booked and payed our tickets online. We were given a slot to enter the park. Making sure not to miss out on anything, we arrived at the gates 2 hours before our actual scheduled time. We wanted to grab a bite to eat before starting the tour. But there were so many people that it took us that 2 hours to just get into the park at our allocated time slot. Becasue of overcrowding we had to wait in lone lines to see the animal show and to get to ride the guided ride. This was such a shamed because we ended up not even seeing half the park before we were asked to started exiting the park a half and hour before the advertised closing time. We went all the way, spend all that money and only got to see half of it, because of crowing we could'nt even enjoy the fire breathers show. The park is stunning and the animals very interesting to experience at night. But due to the park taking and allowing for number of visitors to enter, many people left complaining. I guess this is what greed does, they make their money and don;t really care if the visitors fully enjoy what they paid for. Afterwards we had to wait for quite some time for a taxi to arrive. The food was also not worth it, huge portions but absolutely tasteless. We tried the burger joint to the left of the gate entrance.

Yes this is a busy time of year But the way this was managed was very disappointing. We arrived late for our booked 7.15 tour because we mis-timed the bus. The bus takes 40 minutes from the train station, allow for this in your planning. The 8.15 tour was sold out so we waited for the 9.15. At 8.45 a crowd of about 500 people descended on the Entry line. By the time we realised what was going on we were miles back in line. And there were many others behind us. There were so many people we didn't get through the gate until 9.45, only to then have to queue up for at least another half an hour to get the tram. So our tour started a whole hour after the booked entry time. At no time were we told this could be the case. We had children aged 7-12 with us. If we had known this we wouldnt have purchased the 9.15 tickets.

The safari recommends you get off the tram and take the trails to see more of the animals. But because it was so busy the trams did not stop. We wanted to see the Leopard trail but from the one and only tram stop it was a 30 minute walk to the start of the trail. By this time it was 10.45 which was too late.

The actual safari itself was great. Ticket sales should be reduced to about one third of the current levels. The over-crowding made the whole experience very unpleasant and we are extremely disappointed we did not get to experience it properly.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:04:36.132145

It wasnt as crowded given its a public holiday eve..
The Singapore Zoo and Night Safari is an icon even for us Singaporeans, we are proud of its standing as a very unique and only one in the world night time viewing of the nocturnal animals.
But what saddened me is being let down by extremely poor service by one particular staff called Luqman.
Whilst waiting for the Tram and we were waiting pretty orderly.. he raised his voice to tell us to move to another line and i was with my dad and wife and we were with our 2 and a half yr old child.
It was totally unnecessary as noone was shoving or being unorderly.
I would have shouted back at the Luqman dude but my dad stopped me.

I seriously hope the Night safari looks into training their staff to handle crowds better as well as having staff to be trained to be smiling and not given stoned looks.

Just think Singapore Airlines and please learn from them.

Getting back to town was not a problem as there were lines of taxis. Our ride cost $20.

The whole experience of observing the animals in the dark within their natural surroundings was quite memorable. With the prior booking of tickets for the Zoo, Bird Park, River Safari and Night Safari together, through the internet, the entrance was hassle free.
The queue for the tram was longer than expected but at last, we were on the tram. It takes around 45 minutes to complete the tour. The guide instructs you about the dos and don'ts beforehand, so do listen carefully (do not use flash for the camera as the animals are quite close sometimes and get startled with the blinding light). The tour gives you glimpses of the creatures of the night very closely.
After the tour, you have many restaurants to choose from, for dinner. A fire dance show, conducted by the artists, was a treat to watch.

Tip: Be on time. Early the better.
It is always better to choose the earliest safari time if you are commuting through public transportation for going back to your hotel,.
If you have booked all the parks then it's better to cover River safari, Zoo and Night safari in one day and the Bird park can be covered on the other day.
With young children always opt for tram rather than walking as it is night time.
Carry your cameras, water bottles and insect repellent.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:05:03.314526

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/PappanMajumdar,451595649,13-01-2017,5,Really an experience you could not miss...almost a bucket list activity,"This was my second visit to the Night Safari. This time with family. I didn't remember the first visit too much, but all I remembered is that this is a must experience for somebody who hasn't been to a night safari before. The concept itself is so unique that one must experience it. It is the sense of anticipation. First going for a tourist activity in the night that too which involves wildlife gets your pulse racing and you wonder what's in store.

The Night Safari is a zoo which you experience in the night! So, you can see wildlife in natural type surroundings in the night. One would assume that seeing wild animals in the night means they would be more at home and natural. Coming to the activity and the arrangement, it is superb. Right from the location to the entrance and then the enclosures of animals, everything is planned so well. The tram ride where you just keep quiet in anticipation and strain your eyes to catch the wild is simply an awesome experience. Must mention that the animal enclosures are strategically made so that the animal can be almost guaranteed to be found and seen by the visitors. Unless it is raining!

When we went it was raining heavily. We opted for the 7.30 pm slot. And we couldn't see many animals as they were into their shelters because of the heavy rain. So, after the first ride, we had dinner and then suddenly after dinner we noticed that the rain had eased, so we took a second ride!! Yes, you can take as many rides in the tram as you want with one booking. In our second tram ride, we caught all the animals - tiger, elephant, zebra, deer, buffalo, hyena, hogs, anteater, etc. The tram ride has long queues which are fast moving, though. So, at the outset might look as if it is going to take a lot of time, but average waiting time would be 15-20 minutes in a scenario of decently long queue. What they do in times of long queue, is introduce two sides of boarding points and they have trams coming one after another at a continuous pace.

Points of observation/tips/things to note:

1. How to reach using public transport - You have to reach Ang Mo Kio MRT on the North-South MRT Line. From there you could take a bus (No. 138) or you could take a cab. A cab would cost you approx SGD 15-17 and would take you half hour flat. A bus would take you minimum 50 minutes. What we did I feel was sensible. While going to Night Safari we took a cab because we had to reach there by 7.15 pm and we could not reach late. But while coming back in the night at around 10.30 pm we took the bus as in the night the bus takes just 35-40 minutes from Night Safari to Ang Mo Kio MRT as there is no traffic and the bus can skip many of the stops. The bus stand @ Night Safari is right next to the entrance, so you don't have to walk much. streetdirectory.com might give you more options of buses where you have to change the bus, etc. I would recommend Bus No 138 as you don't need to change anywhere. But do look up streetdirectory.com for more options and live timings of buses, MRT etc. It is the most amazing app you could have in Singapore.

2. The tram rides - I have read lots of reviews on TA which advises you to take the tram ride first if the queue is short and then do other stuff and the other way round if the queue is long. Well, frankly it doesn't matter. As I told you that it is very well managed and the queue even if long clears fast. My recommendation is to take the tram ride first because it gives you a perspective of the Night Safari arena. You could identify walking trails during the ride which you could come back and visit later. Also, when we went it was raining so we were sensible that we decided to take the tram ride first as the shows like Creatures of the Night got cancelled and you couldn't have walked anyways. So, my advice is to take the tram ride first even if the queue is long. Also, in case you don't see all the animals in the first tram ride, you could always take a second tram ride as you would have time in your hand. The trams have a running commentary in English which alerts you on all the animals you are about to see and approach and also backgrounders on those animals.

3. Eating there - there is the Ulu Ulu restaurant area. There are lots of eating options there including an Indian one. There is also a buffet option which is demarcated. We didn't opt for it so we don't know how is the fare there. But all I can say that the action in the non-buffet area is much more and livelier. There is one drinks counter there where you get all the alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks you want.

4. Booking - I booked through the Wildlife Reserves website where you can book for up to 4 activities - Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park, Singapore Zoo and River Safari. You get some discount if you book for more activities. I opted for only Jurong Bird Park and Night Safari. For Jurong Bird Park you get an option to visit anytime within a week. But for Night Safari you get an option of only a particular date and a time slot. So, please ensure you plan your visit to Night Safari in a concrete manner if you are booking well in advance. There are 4 slots 7.30 pm, 8.30 pm, 9.30 pm and 10.30 pm. I would recommend the 7.30 pm slot because you might as well go there and experience the tram ride first and then have enough time to do other stuff like dinner, go for walking trails, do more tram rides, see the shows, etc. Also, in most cases, if you go to Night Safari, you will practically do nothing more that evening anyways because it is far and secluded and doesn't have any other things to do in the vicinity.

5. If it rains - then they have arrangements to sit in the tram and they have these polythene screen guards which they bring down on all sides. So, you are protected from the rain and at the same time, you can see through the polythene sheet. But, obviously, it is a dampener as sometimes you cannot see things clearly. So, if it rains then anything at the Night Safari becomes a dampener. The shows get cancelled and the dinner area also gets restricted as you cannot sit in the open and finally you cannot go for those walking trails. So, please pray that it doesn't rain when you visit!!

6. Shows and walks - we were unlucky that it was raining. So, all shows of the Creatures of the Night were cancelled except the last one at 10.30 pm which we then decided not to go because we were too tired and it was a bit late with a 6-year-old daughter. So, we missed the show which I believe is a very good one. Just wanted to point out something. If it rains, then don't lose hope. Because the moment the rain stops, the organisers will open up the next show timing. And in Singapore, just like it can start raining any moment, it could stop raining any moment too irrespective of how heavy it might be. About the walks, must point out that there are lots of trails like the Leopard Trail, the Wallaby trail, etc. We didn't venture out to those, but they definitely look very interesting. I think you should take out time and go for these walks. My view is just to be on your own in front of the animals is more of an adventure than just seeing the animal from the tram which gives you some sense of protection. Also, when you go for a walk you obviously have the luxury to spend whatever time you want looking at a particular animal.

7. Must point out that like every other place everything is well organised and the staff is efficient and courteous in spite of the huge rush and queue for the trams. So, compliments to the organisers.

To summarise, Night Safari is a must for people who haven't experienced it. It is a once in a lifetime kind of experience. It is unique. And trust me you will not regret the visit. You get to see most of the animals as the enclosures are made strategically in such a manner that the animals can be found out in the open and seen easily. The night lighting is done in such a manner that you get that adventure feel of actually seeing an animal in the night. A must do if you have kids above 5 to 6 years of age.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:05:04.809005

Yes it's at night, which is kinda cool but also makes it more difficult to see the animals, particularly for kids. It also means no flash photography, although there's always THAT guy (don't be that guy).
Lastly, I failed to notice any more activity on the part of the animals. The tiger was dead asleep against the glass. We couldn't see him from the tram. We saw his back smushed against the glass on the walking trail.
The walking trails are a nice touch and it was cool to see the kangaroos and wallabies, I haven't seen those in person before.

After the show we went to lineup for the tram ride. English being the most predominate language spoken by tourist and locals you would think that there would be more than one English speaking tram- no there is only one tram that speaks English. We had to wait nearly one hour to get on a tram to complete the safari. The safari itself was ok. It was hard to see most of the animals but the animals you could see were cool.

For the 10pm creatures of the night show, people were advised to begin queuing an hour beforehand. For us, this meant missing out on either the Safari tram ride itself, or the Show. Very poor and recommend you pass on this show during school holidays or end of year season. Staff could be better trained too, many spoke aggressively and dismissively trying to marshall the long queues and crowds.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-30 15:05:15.079297

Even on a weekday there is lot of rush (may be because I visited during Christmas holidays) and the waiting for tram was almost like 50-60 mins. Take the tram ride for sure as it covers most of the park and then you can explore on walking tours along the trails of your interest.

We got there early so we could do the first train tour because we have a young child. You take a train ride around the park which takes around 45 minutes then you're free to walk around yourself on the walking tracks. I'd recommend doing the walk as well as it's a nice walk and you can stop and observe the animals for as long as you like. We also were lucky enough to come across a couple of zoo keepers and enjoyed asking them lots of questions about the animals. We particularly enjoyed the otters and were offered some pallets from the zoo keeper to feed to them. My son thought this was the highlight as they're funny creatures and very noisy.
In regards to the trains - what we did notice however is when we saw later trains, around 8pm, there was hardly anyone on them. So if you have older children, or none at all, then I'd say come a little later to avoid the hordes of people and queues.
We took public transport to get out there which was simple and inexpensive however it will take around 1.5 hours to get there on the train & bus (from Marina Bay Sands). By taxi it takes 30 minutes and costs around $30.
I noted that another reviewer said a potential problem was that you were committed to the date and time when you bought the tickets. I found that to be true of most online providers except one. VOYAGIN. I bought my tickets on the day from an online reseller called VOYAGIN. The ticket didn't offer a hard date or time. We arrived early just in case we couldn't get into the first train ride but there was no problem at all. The tickets were valide for around 3 months I think and for any of the time slots. I recommend this company as their prices were competitive and as i said, offered a choice of day & time.
Oh, don't bother trying to take pictures, they generally won't work. The only ones that worked were of the flamingoes. I was using my iPhone.

Visiting a zoo at night is not something you get to do anywhere else, and the exhibits get you up close and personal with exotic animals from around the world. Buy tickets online, and arrive early. My suggestion is to go to the Animals of the Night show first, and then do the tram tour. After the tram ride, be sure to do all of the walking trails. The tram ride is very good, but the trails get you close to the animals, and you can move at your own pace. The zoo is a long way from downtown, but if you plan things right, you can save a bundle on transportation. The zoo web site tells you which train stops to use and which bus routes to take from there to the zoo grounds. The bus drops you off right at the gate. Keep in mind that the last bus leaves about midnight, but you need to leave about 10:30 to get the last train.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Bligey,445088146,19-12-2016,5,A Must See Activity,"Opening after dark and staying open until late, this is a superb opportunity to see nocturnal creatures such as lions, tigers, bears, wolves, tapirs (and so on and so on) in an active state in a generally undisturbed environment. The lights in the canopy are enough to provide good viewing of teh animals as well as shortening the perspective so that it seems as if the animals are almost within touching distance (mostly they're not - they're safely behind electric fences, water and ditches) and some actually are roaming freely (antelope, etc).

You have to take a buggy ride which lasts about 40 minutes but, afterwards, you can wander around on various trails at your leisure. I recommend the fruit bat enclosure.

There are plenty of choices to eat in a large food court and some tours have dinner included. As always, there are plenty of shopping opportunities too.

Be aware. It can be very crowded and there is a lot of organisation required as you will be marshalled around according to which type of ticket you've purchased. Going with an organised tour is a good way to cut through the crowds.

This was my second visit and I'd recommend it to anyone.",11-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:05:58.222601

Our older kids (9 y/o) enjoyed the visit but the 5yo did not.
If you travel with young kids, my advise is enter the park earlier. (best is 7.15pm) slot. because it will be too tiring for kids if you enter at later time. we spend about 2 hours for this visit, tram ride and watch the show.

we took the tram ride, and did not go on foot trail. as kids are afraid of dark. The animals in the park can come up close near you even we are on the tram. that is incredible experience. you get to the wonders of the creator who created all different species of animals which you hardly tell their names.

Enjoy seeing with your eye and don't bother about taking pictures as it will be too dark for you to take a nice shot. There are frequent reminders not to use flash light as it is harmful for animals eye. So be co-operative and mindful as many eyes will be watching at you if you use flash.

Must not forget the excellent tram guide Damien (may spell wrongly) who guided us along the ride, telling the visitors stories and description of different animals. He has make the tram ride enjoyable and educational one.

We did river safari earlier in the day before coming to night safari. The river safari closes at about 6 PM and the night safari opens at 7:15 PM. So usually people manage to grab a bite at one of the over priced restaurants in the area just outside the night safari entrance. The night safari is located in quite a remote area of the city and as such there're no eating options in the immedaite vicinity outside the park. So you're forced to eat at the park (unless of course you've taken your own food with you).
The night safari tickets are primarily for a tram ride that takes you through the park. You're allowed to enter the park anytime AFTER the time mentioned on your ticket. I'd advice to enter after 8 PM if possible, as that will help avoid the opening time heavy rush. You can probably have a meal in that time.
So we entered the park around 7:30 PM. Had to wade through quite a huge line (about 15 min of wait time). Their trams keep running every 2-3 min or so. The tram is open and takes you through the enclosures of different animals. Even though the animals are not enclosed in tight cages, there're moats and thin wire meshes that do make you wonder if it's a fancy zoo. I've done numerous wild life safari trips and I can vouch that this was not a safari. Nevertheless, people who haven't been on wildlife trips and children are bound to enjoy this.
The tram moves slowly through the enclosures and being in Singapore it becomes quite stuffy and hot. This could be a problem for those with infants.
Once the tram ride was over we came out of the park. After a not so short wait of 15 min at the taxi stand (and 2-3 refusals from taxi drivers to come to our area), we managed to get a taxi and reach home.
The conclusion would be that it is more hyped but could still be enjoyable if you've not been to a wild life safari before.",11-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:06:33.724549

I really dont enjoy the privilege of paying to stand in a que for most of the evening whilst they try and cram more people into an already overcrowded park that is incapable of holding the people that it already has in it let alone the 1000 people there then letting every hour later. Its no fun for anyone standing tightly packed in a que with people that have been sweating all day and may not be aware that there personal hygiene leaves a little to be desired let alone the health and safety implications of cramming so many people into a dimly lit park full of animals and with staff that appear to be unaware of whats going on run by a camp Basil Fawlty, the place is just a recipe for disaster and all the staff seem to want to do is create as much chaos and havoc as possible to keep you busy and to stop you joining an already very long que. We asked for directions to the show and we were sent to the exit, the lady there sent us back to where we had just come from ???? to another guy who again tried to send us to the exit. So to try and get something out of the evening we joined the very long que for the trams where they try and force you to have your photo taken and when you finally get on the tram its then held up whilst they try and take another photo ??? (Hello !!!! look at the que ???)One of the most blatant cash grabs ive ever seen (i felt embarrassed for them). We did enjoy the tram ride but after it was over we had had enough so this time they showed us the exit we too it, gave up on trying to see the show and joined the melee outside which resembled euro 2016 in an effort to secure a taxi which was just as disorganised and chaotic as it was inside the park. But to end on a positive note the highlight of the evening was the fire dancers ! which turned out to be 2 women twirling glow sticks !!!???!!! it was that pathetic and poorly done it was actually hilarious it did make us laugh in what was otherwise a dismal night.

The animals are so active that it's as though their feeding time is synchronised with the opening hours of the night safari. They put on a great show at night, this is a must see attraction. The otters near the entry are especially awesome, they are so animated.

I have seen conjecture about whether to take the train ride early in your visit or later. Let me explain, the train ride is a guided light rail system that takes you through the biggest walking parts of the zoo. I recommend waiting until the early rush for the train is over. Walk downhill at the start of the zoo and when you. Get about halfway down then catch the train. There will be no queues and you will have already seen the animals that you can on foot, so stepping onto the train at this point is most efficient. The train animals are at the bottom of the hill so it flows well to take the train later, this way you only do one circuit. If you do the train first then you end up doing two circuits of the zoo",08-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:06:53.454578

The darkness is a big factor in that. As you walk or ride the tram, you notice the animals and not the enclosures, and it really gives a convincing illusion of encountering these animals in the wild.

Our son, age 8, loved it, although he was a bit nervous at times and decided not to go into the bat walk (my wife and I took turns walking through, and it was great), so younger kids may find some of it frightening.

We arrived after 8:30 after a bit of a slow start, and a fair amount of bus/subway travel. There is timed admission, so we entered at 9 PM, but the very entertaining fire show took place in the entrance area so the wait was not a problem at all. Entering at 9 we were able to catch the Creatures of the Night show, then board a tram and do just about all of the walking exhibits at the tram station before catching one of the last trams back before closing time. We missed some of the walking attractions, so you should probably arrive earlier than we did if you're determined to see everything, but we were very satisfied with seeing almost all of the attraction.

This is a truly unique and immersive experience and well worth a visit.",10-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:07:21.700584

We reached 20 minutes before our tour time but still could not enter because you need to be in queue 45 minutes prior to your tour time! This is something not mentioned by anyone - neither in the brochures, by the viator agent or the hotel guys so be very cognizent of this fact and plan your trip accordingly.

So we queued for close to an hour outside and it was really hot. No air conditioned walkways unlike other attractions. There was a fire eating dance show going on right next to the entrance queue which added to the heat and was uncomfortable! There were about 4-5 lines and only those on the left most queues could see the entire thing as its not on a stage. We were in the right most and caught just a few glimpses of it but plenty of the heat.

After getting through the entrance, you need to head for the tram boarding points if you are going on that (which you should as it takes you around and shows all the animals). There was a rush for queues again here which really really sucked after having to queue just to get in for an hour already! The bad part here was that after you enter its a free passageway and than you need to find the tram boarding point and rush there to stand in queue again. They have 2 tram boarding stations and after the queue to the 1st tram station is pretty full they allow the people to go to the 2nd tram station. So people who would have been towards the end of the entrance queue outside got to be at the head of the 2nd tram station line (sigh!) Both the trams leave one after the other so hope you get the point! Another drawback - the tram queues were narrowly boxed in so had to fold up the Pram and carry it as well! Took close to an hour here again to board the tram

Once you are on the tram and it starts moving - its great! You get a close up view of the animals, the night time lighting, the feeding, the commentary - everything is superb. They have various points along the ride where you have an option to get off and go on the walking trails - you can reboard the next tram but given the harrowing time we had boarding the tram the first time round decided not to risk it! Good thing is that they don't crowd you into the tram and you can sit comfortably

If not for the poor management at both the entry queues and tram boarding queues would have been an excellent outing. They really should manage it better and cut down on the waiting time. This is a place where usually children visit and its really makes them cranky standing around in queues and waiting for so long! Even adults would get tired.

Tip - Dress summery but carry a light shawl/sweater as once you are on the tram and into the jungle it gets a little chilly",08-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:07:46.164428

My biggest tip is avoid the instant lines for the trams when you get in and walk the trails first and join the tram at a stop further in.

The night show is OK but is not that spectacular and I am not sure I would go and see it again. Better off looking at the animals.",10-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:07:46.534415

The audio on the tram ride kept breaking down and when it did work it was often out of sync with the feature we were passing. No separate commentary from the driver which other reviewers commented on favourably.

Appreciate these are somewhat wild animals in an open area so sighting can be unpredictable. But we saw little other than a wide range of deer species. Certainly not the breadth of animal life I had expected.

We got a tour from the hotel which was good because you got transport there and back, and you got priority in the queues...however it did mean you were constrained by time and we could have done with another hour to see everything without feeling rushed. There is always the option of getting a taxi back if you miss the bus though, and I don't think this is hugely expensive...
The night safari itself is excellent. It really is very dark and the animals are softly lit but you can see them very clearly. You can take the train around (recommended) so you see everything and then can walk around the different areas to spend more time viewing. Lovely and warm this time of year and nice to be out of the sun and heat of the day.
So many beautiful animals here and you are very close to them. The way they've set it up makes it look like there are no fences, so it really feels like a safari. As with everything in Singapore, lovely and clean and tidy, friendly and helpful staff.
Lots of different food places here and of course lots of souvenirs!

I enjoyed the safari. Luckily we got there for when it opened, as we were really watching the time towards the end, as we definitely did not want to miss our bus home.

We watched the fire show whilst waiting in line, so couldn't get a great view of it.

Once in, we went straight to the other show. The family enjoyed it. The two presenters were very good.

Once over, we went to the tram ride. We waited about 10 mins to get on. We only hopped off at one stop, otherwise we stayed on the tram. I think you could see most animals whilst on the tram.

We started the visit with a tram ride that was included in the ticket, it took about 40mins or so. The tram ride was like a brief introduction to the park. It was really serene at night, the guide on the tram was constantly reminding everyone not to make loud noise or take flash photography. The tram ride bring you up close to some animals, we were so close to a Tapir that we can touch it! (Probably not allowed though)

After the tram ride, there are trails to follow. These trails leads you to artificial caves, waterfall and a stroll into the rainforest. There were quite a few ""walk-through"" that let you be up close again with animals like kangaroo?, flying foxes etc! Nice!

The part that awed me most was how the whole park was integrated into the rainforest! It look so natural and does not look like a man-made park at certain part.

As a local who visits this place often i will share with you the tips to get the most out of the trip.
Attire: Long pants and sneakers, sweat absorbing polo tee shirt. No short skirts and slippers or you will quickly regret it. Put on insect repellent liberally before the trip.
Timing : Avoid weekends where possible. To get the most out of this trip, be prepared to spare at least 3hrs. 4hrs is the best.
Things to bring : A tiny map light to read the map in the dark, a handheld fan, bottles of drinking water.
F&B : Food and drinks are ridiculously expensive at the Night Safari and thus i would suggest to have your dinner in town first before heading there.
Once the park is open, you can try the 7:30pm night show if you have children or skip it totally as it's not really worth cajoling and queuing up for. DO NOT take the trams at this stage unless you want to waste another 30mins queuing up for it. Walk the trails starting with wallaby trail and aim for East Lodge rest stop.After that head back towards the main entrance via Leopard and Fishing Cat trails. The whole exercise will take you about 1.5hours. Then you take the trams at the mainstation. At this point of time, there should be no or minimal queues at the tram station.

Once there you line up to get in....then you join a massive queue to catch a tram. The tram is worth doing.....but next time I'd skip it at the start and just head out on the trails.
Whilst on the tram you see animals whilst listening to a pre-recorded voice over. The thing I couldn't get past was that the whole thing felt a bit like Jurassic Park where they try to lure the T-Rex out with the goat. All the animals seemed to be waiting for food or had just been fed. It just lacked a ""natural"" feel and felt forced.
Once off the tram we walked two of the trails....the otters were putting on a show which became the highlight.
The transport to and from the venue is really well organised. We considered waiting to catch the bus home....but it was late and we were tired so we opted to catch a taxi instead.

I went with my family while on vacation at Singapore and it was hit among us. It was a very unique experience. I will, however, say that I was disappointed in the safari ride. All that they drove by were deer and possibly a few lions or elephants. I wasn't to happy to see deer because I can see them where I live so it wasn't so unique to me. I do highly suggest walking around the park though. The ride does not give justice to the park and if you just go on the ride and leave, you are missing out. There are do many cute animals that you can see while walking and if your lucky a lion may roar or a hyena may bark. I found it to be a real cool experience that I haven't experienced anywhere else!",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:24.407324

With it being at night, some of the animals are hard to see and also like to sleep when the sun isn't shining. There are animals that were awake and were very striking, the White Lion and the rhino to mentions couple. Also there was a number of different species of deer, which in the dark all looked very very similar but great to see up close.
The staff were great and very happy and smiley, making my children smile too but they had a difficult time seeing the animals. I don't think they were disappointed but after doing the zoo in the morning I think they expected more.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:25.086098

The standard tour involves loads of people in a tram and you're round the park and back in 40mins. You don't stop at any time for a closer look or to shake hands with some creatures.

The Premium tour starts with a full buffet dinner which was great. Your own personal tour guide (ours was Walter who's knowledge is second to none!) meets up at the restaurant where you are taken to the creatures of the night show. I have to say we felt like some sort of celebs as you are taken to the very front of the queue and have reserved seats at the front! There are thousands of people around so the queues are insane!

Following that you are taken to your own buggy where you have roughly 2 hours in the park with your tour guide.

The addition to this package is that you get to personally feed the elephants. This was an experience I will never forget.

Yes the premium package is expensive but if you're going to do the tour, then you should do it right.

I would go back in a heart beat.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:30.995714

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mpmadz,414786496,05-09-2016,3,Good experience.,"We visited this place on a pre-arranged tour. Do not try to walk-in if you do not want to queue for hours. Eat first before heading to this place. This place is far from the city, its about an hour drive. And because its night safari they get busy at 7pm and your entire tour will probably finish by 12 midnight.

There were 5,000 people in the park all at the same time according to our tour guide. We had buffet dinner in one of the restaurants(part of the pre-arranged tour) before hopping on the buggy train that showed us around. Thankfully we got a pre-arranged tour on here otherwise we would have queued like crazy.

Animals were not caged but surprisingly they stayed where they are. If you want to enjoy the entire safari you're gonna have to take the trail, meaning you walk on foot so u can see more of their animals. Some areas were really dark so its hard to see the animals. In some areas, the buggy drives fast, i think to catch up with the new crowd waiting. After the safari we watched the animal show. The animal show is not a circus show, so don't expect any lions or tigers jumping in hoops.

There are also fire dancers, but in other Asian and African countries we take fire dancing
seriously. I was a bit disappointed to see the fire dance was not fire dance at all. Poor guys just blowing alcohol to create fire.

Nevertheless, it was a nice experience. Make sure that if u have kids to pre-arrange your tour or to avoid visiting on weekends and holidays.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:31.662603
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Bosswitch,414779873,05-09-2016,4,Different and worth a visit,"The night Safari is a different experience to the ordinary zoo trip and well worth a trip. We booked for the 8.15pm entry and had to stand in a queue to be let in. Alongside the queue was the fire eaters show and they didn't let us in until that had ended. Being small I couldn't see anything of the show but thought I'd be able to go to the next one. If there was one then it wasn't advertised which it seems a bit unfair for everyone on the 8.15,9.15 and 10.15 shows as we'd all paid the same. One of the reasons we chose the 8.15 was that it had far more tickets available than the 7.15 making it less busy and I also hoped to avoid lots of young children, in particular I was trying to avoid pushchairs. This worked to some extent but you still still get some people bringing out very young children late at night. The night show is worth attending as the keepers bring out animals to show you and explain about them. They ask that you don't use the flash on your camera. He explained that it damages the animals eyes as well as scaring them. He repeated this in at least 5 languages but there were still ignorant people using a flash!. If you go to the show first then there isn't such a large queue for the trams as everyone races to these when they open the doors. The tram ride is excellent with great views and good informative commentary. We saw tigers moving about whereas in the daytime they always just lie still. The baby elephant was especially adorable. At the end of the tram ride you can walk up some of the trails to see additional animals. I recommend you see the leopard which was patrolling his large enclosure and we got great views. Although they say you can hop on and off the tram in reality you can only do this at a couple of stops and even at night it's still hot so plan your route. I suggest you use your insect repellent but the biting insects were no where near as bad as I expected. The ice cream sold at the entrance/exit is excellent but pricey! Price wise I think the entrance fee is a bit expensive but hopefully this goes towards the care of the animals so I don't mind. Our only negative experience was the taxi back which wasn't the zoo's fault. The taxi we got in didn't have a working middle seat belt in the back and the driver didn't want to stop and let us get out to get another taxi. Eventually he turned round when we insisted for the 3rd or 4th time and said it wasn't safe. He then tried to charge us even though we'd told him before he set off that the belt didn't work. He knew there was no socket to clip it into but just kept driving. When we did get out he shouted abuse at us as he drove off as he was then at the back of the queue. So if 3 of you need to be in the back check the seat belts before you close the car doors! Otherwise this was a great trip.",08-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:31.987616

It was nice to be able to walk around in the paths and also take the tram. It is amazing how the animals stay in their designated area though there is no visible barrier. The availability of refreshments and the fire show while waiting for admission works well. I was disappointed that at the concession which has frozen root beer slush and ice cream (separately) that the staff is unable to offer a root beer float at any price. That would have been a nice treat. Important to note that the Zoo is pretty far out of the city so we took 3 buses to get there and over an hour. That said, it was quite inexpensive to take the bus.

The line disappeared minutes from the opening time and we strolled in.

I would also suggest that you take the option to not jump straight on the tram (again, long lines at the first stop) but walk on a little bit and then pick it up. There is definitely more to see from the tram and the commentary is good - but you can spend time in line getting hot and sweaty waiting to get on it at the first stop.

Overall we had a good evening. The attraction is ideal for school children – plenty to see, informative, interactive show etc. The park is small enough that you can walk round easily to see everything and/or do another lap on the tram.

Make sure you walk the four trails as that is the best way to see some of the animals up close and for as long as you like. Plus, there are areas to walk through where the animals (Wallaby area, Monkey area, Bat Area) are running free all around you! Plus, how often are there great kid friendly sights to see at night when on vacation? This place was wonderful! If you buy over the internet, cheaper prices. There are set times to enter and you should make reservations ahead of time. Everyone runs straight to the trams and they end up waiting half an hour at least in line.

Just before the gate open there was a fire show. Unfortunately people at the back of the crowds would not see anything especially children. When the gate open the crowds just rushed to get in and queue for the tram. We decided to walk as the queue at the tram is too long.
When we finished walk on the trails we go back to the tram queue and it is still very long (about 100 peoples waiting). The staffs suggested we go to the animal show and show us the way. When we got there (not surprise) another long queue to get in to the show!! We are stucked in between the long queue so we just move along with the queue and watch the show. We managed to get the seats on the far right corner and we only managed to see some of the show! Don't bother if you get the corner seat as you can't see much especially with young children. The show lasted about 20 minutes and we decided to try our luck on the tram. Unfortunately the next session of entry is open and more people are queuing for the tram. My daughter was crying as she wanted to try the tram but we have no choice but to leave as the queue is too long and I have a 2 years old with me as well and I am sure she is gets very frustrated waiting in the line for hours to get into the tram.

Once you go in, there is an animal show first which was enjoyable. Then you take the tram and are given a tour where the animals are pointed out. My family enjoyed it but sometimes I had trouble seeing the animals. I would definitely recommend this if you are in Singapore for 4-5 days. You can take a taxi back if necessary and it was not that expensive, about 25 Singapore dollars.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:58.124135

I have been to concerts, sporting events, opening events, travelled elsewhere and never experienced anything like it. Do not queue up, resist the urge! Wait until the night safari actually opens and than wander in like a normal person not like a stampeding elephant and I didn't understand what the crush was about? What were they all rushing too? The night safari is terrible, we couldn't see a thing, they use moonlight to light the place, there is no lighting visible to my eye, all the animals were sleeping or hiding. I have been to night zoos before and normally at dusk theres the noises of animals roaring, chatting etc, here silence, the only sounds were of tourists asking ""where are all the animals at""? was all we could hear. Terrible. And that show at the start with the fire was horrendous- all the guys were doing was spitting fire starter all over themselves- it was actually quite laughable but I couldn't laugh as I was being pushed in the back and pressed up against random strangers desperate for photos, really if that show impressed you, you need to get out more.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:08:58.495178

I have been to this place with family and we all liked it very much. It is a perfect place for tourist .
Safari starts with fire show at the entrance which is too good. During the safari one can get out of tram and walk till the end of safari during which one can explore wallaby trail which can't be missed.

Best advice is go to the creatures of the night show as som. As you get in and then the crowds to get on the tram die down a bit from 9 am. Plenty of affordable food outlets out the front and we found the easiest way to get there was by taxi. No problems getting a taxi home either there was a massive queue waiting outside even at 11pm. If you want to get there at 7.15pm and wish to repurchase you need to do that 2 days prior online as it sells out.

They offered 15% discount on the price the hotel were offering. Very easy as voucher e mailed to me which I redeemed on arrival at the park. Missed the queue for ticket purchase and saved 8 dollars per ticket.

The Night Safari is quite a bit from the City Center so if travelling from Sentosa as we were it is worth going across to Vivo City and getting taxi from there as booking from Sentosa can be quite expensive.

We went on a Sunday night and it was really busy both the 715pm and the 815pm tours were booked out by the time we got there. Might be worth aiming for the 915pm which was a little more relaxed. The park closes at 12.

The teenagers loved the fruit bats and the flying squirrel. You have to go into their enclosures and it all feels a little Jurassic Parkish.

We did the tram and this was worthwhile but enjoyed doing two of the trails as well.

The creatures of night show was good, my young kids enjoyed it.

Thereafter we queued up for 15-20 mins for the tram to go round the park- not a freestyle safari. The tram takes you round the enclosures, so you see the animals as you would in their enclosures but at night- we saw all of them snd they were awake and in view.

Just like normal zoo, you are able to view feeding times too. Make sure you get the tram with language of your choice!

After this we watched the fire show and because it was so late, ate at Indian tandoor ( halal outlet), before we left.

It appeared that there were other shorter tram stops nearby but most people were directed into the long one and there was very little signage suggestion there may be other options. The ""need"" to take souvenir photos of everyone in the trains certainly slowed the process unnecessarily.

The tram ride when we finally got on it was very good and it was a chance to see animals we hadn't seen before.

Once off the tram we followed some of the trails to look at the animals again. It seemed that once you were on them, it was either turn around a me go back or follow them all to the end. Options to return to the entry gate at different stages of the trails would have been good.

Although the concept is good, the execution is extremely poor. The crowds are unmanageable, all we did was wait, wait and wait.
Arrived at 7pm, 7:15 and 8:15 entries were all sold out. Ok, we take 9:15 thinking we will have time to have dinner and then still plenty of time to do the show (9:30), tram and trails. Gosh, we were so wrong...
Food is overpriced, and not even good. Then we queue again with the other people with 9:15 tickets. Staff blocked the gates just before us saying there was a 1h30hr queue for the tram. So we have 9:15 tickets, but we still cannot go in?!. Ok... can we go in for the show? No, the 9:30 show is already full.
I don't get this, if you let a certain amount of people in at a certain time, then you need to police people to leave as well or the principle does not work. Unless you have 7:15 ticvkets, there is no way you can do the show that is scheduled 15min later.
By the way, that show, ""creatures of the night"" is a joke. There is a line for that, but you will see a raccoon, some type of lemurian, a snake, a hyenaand that's about it. Dont expect anything fancy worth the pain, no, just a girl who hypes the crowd.
Then back to the tram, back to another long line. We finally make it to one of the last trams (thanks to Chand, only updise of the night!). Our driver obviously had enough, he kept pushing the gas pedal, we were right behind another tram all the time. He would have to hit the brake pedal not to rerar end it in some turns, we thought he wanted to pass. Some animals were active, but most were not or so far back in their areas that we could not see them anyway.
Summary of the evening: we arrived at 7pm, we had a horrible meal, saw a horrible ""show"" (can;t believe they even use that word, it's barely a presentation of 5 animals) and took a 40minute tram. We left at midnight. If I include dinner, say 1.5hr of ""fun"" for 3.5hr wait. Impossible to do the trails with all that time wasted in queues. Totally not wort it. If you want to use timed entries, then make sure the number of people is appropriate, and people exit. If you enter at 7:15, you can spend the night there, if you enter at 10:15, you will enjoy the long lines (since the ones from previous hours don't have to leave).

The tram ride, although as good as usual, had the usual crowd but this time no priority boarding for annual pass holders which I find very frustrating. Staff on the tram are very slack too because there were so many people using flash photography yet they didn't do or say anything about it.

Despite all these failings it is still a good place to bring the young family because where else in Singapore do you get to see so many animals in one place.

The animals were difficult to see due to the foliage and the fact they were often at the back of the enclosure. You have to queue for the tickets and it feels a bit frenzied to get there early and can be very busy.
Its also quite along way from the city centre so if you don't have a car it does take time getting there and back.

I booked online which received a 10% discount however the tickets still totalled $108. On arrival we had to negotiate 45 minutes (or more) waiting time to take the tram around the park. The animals that we saw were an abundance of deer of several 'varieties' with a few star 'attractions' thrown in on occasion. Sadly neither the giraffes nor the zebras were 'available' which was not communicated prior to booking.

Then the tram ride through the zoo shows a dozen different animals, most of which were asleep or looked dazed/ drugged. It may as well have been called the madam tussauds safari, as most animals looked like waxworks.

The most recent time was last weekend and it was terrible.

It's packed with tourists from 7pm until 10pm+. Queues take at least 40-50 minutes. It's a people-safari because you cannot see any other animals.

The ""Night Creature"" show is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. It used to be longer and more fun, with more acts and really like a show. Now, there's a lot of talking, 3 acts in which some animals would come out and go back in. it lasts for 15 minutes. It's a waste of time!!

If you haven't been, can try once.
If you have been, don't go back.

Little has been done to modernise the attraction. It still retains a uniqueness that makes it a key attraction but for us it has lost its charm. This loss has been caused by it being a victim of its own success. Tour packages and general sales have clearly taken off. Significant foreign visitors from China, India and Arab countries have forced a four slot timed entry programme from 7.15 at hourly intervals. The shows (which last 15 minutes) are full about 25 minutes before they start (7.30, 8.30, 9.30 and 10.30pm) and that is with about an 800 seat amphitheatre.

Opportunities for people to interact with animals are almost non-existent. For instance only two of the general public at the show get to interact with any animals at all. How difficult would it be to set up a snake handling area for instance for before and after the show.

The staff seem not to be well drilled to optimise the publics experience and the sight of half-filled tour trains sailing past when you are queuing is quite galling. On the tour trains the diction is clearer than the somewhat charming Singlish that used to prevail. There are still some remnants to keep those linguistically inclined on their toes as they await the next hyaena (such as the incorrect use of matured (past participle) instead of mature).

The commercial edge has grown also and that has also eroded the charm.

On a positive note there are discounts for under 12s, over 60s and Singaporean residents if you book online.

Other reviewers are correct- 45 min wait, at best. Either get there early (6:30) and wait for 45 min or get there at 7:15, and wait 45 min (general admission). The entire attraction is the tram tour. It lasts around 40 min and is pleasant but there's not a lot to see. We're originally from the U.S. so we don't find deer and raccoons to be exotic. We've also been to lots of zoos and such so we don't get overly excited about elephant, hyena, or lions. That's nearly all the animals they have. It's neat that the animals appear unrestrained but by 8:30pm they were all going to sleep anyway. Left side of tram seemed to have more up-close experiences with the animals. Take a left when departing the tram to go to the show at the amphitheatre (instead of being hoarded into the restaurant by staff). The show is for little kids and is short and sweet with a goofy style. It wasn't an awful experience and my 11 year old seemed to enjoy it.

We expected something more from this night safari...how ever it's disappointed since we can't see many animal around. Even they offer us to walk around the park...we could not do it because the timing is really tight...then we go back to hotel.

But once the ride started it was excellent. It seemed that the animals were on stage for us, and they were really close.

After the tram ride finished we decided to walk the wallaby trail to experience the safari on foot.

I have been to this attraction many times in the past and have always enjoyed the commentaries on the trams and also the host of the show. My last visit a week ago however has made me feel that i never want to go back again.
I know that this attraction has become very popular with tourist in SIngapore and the crowds are not a bad reflection of the attraction, however the manner in which people are treated at the Night Safari has left a bad taste with me.
One has to wait over 3 hours to get on to a tram. Children are heard crying and hungry. I feel for the tourist as this attraction has raised its prices at the FnB outlets. How does one justify a plate of plain noodles or local chicken rice for over $19 !! Its a total rip off and tourist are forced to pay as they have no other choice. Its not like the food is of Michelin star grade.

To add to this , the lovely ""LIVE"" commentary on the trams has been replaced with a recorded commentary. As you approach a certain section, it tells you to look left or right in order to spot an animal. The tram is moving and it is dark and often the animals are not in full view and the driver just moves on leaving curious onlookers ""in the dark"". Why this live commentary has been taken off the trams has probably due to cost cutting measure in trying to train staff.

Staff seemed to be interested in talking to each other more than interacting with people. The only time u get attention from a staff member is when they annoyingly try and take pictures of you and sell you the same afterwards. Most tourist and people visiting these attractions usually have their own cameras and annoying selfie sticks with flash taking their own pictures. Why have your staff ""crying"" out annoyingly to sell a photograph.

Management should also record the commentary of the host at the shows and play it back to them to see if the host follow and understand what they are saying. Half the show is about educating people to turn off their flash feature on their cameras.

First, we had a dinner at the buffet restaurant (forgot the name of the restaurant). We choose to sit at a quite comfortable table for four before a staff came. What I did not like was the staff wanted us to move to other table so that a group of Japanese will take our table (who came about 10 minutes later). Actually, I did not get the logic of transferring us to a table that we didn't choose in the first place. The second thing that I was bit offended when the same restaurant staff approached us again and repeatedly telling us the buffet price which is very awkward in our part as customers. We are not rich people and we don't look like rich people, but before we decided to go to that restaurant we assured that we had enough money to spend. Then, after that lousy dinner we headed to an animal show. I found that the host is very clever, she can speak different languages (very impressive) and the show was quite entertaining. Last, was falling asleep during the tram ride because was really so tired standing in that horrible long crowded compact queue. I did see unrecognizable animals far from my sight but it was a whole crap! Sorry, really it was really bad experience and very un-entertained.",08-2015,Family,2020-01-30 15:10:47.436157
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/EuniceOng,391915951,13-07-2016,3,The only good thing is you see the animals up REAL close,"The safari is open for only a few hours as staff and visitors need to sleep obviously, so it closes at midnight. However it also becomes too dark to see anything properly, making the things you can do here really limited. And you cant come too early like 7-6pm cos the animals might not have waken up yet.

Because of the darkness, its really hard to wander on your own in the park - they're really thoughtful to create the animals' real natural environment so streetlights were a bare minimum. The dense vegetation also makes it hard to figure your way around :( I strongly recommend taking the tram which goes one round around the entire park. That ride is pretty much the highlight of the entire visit, but guessing it was a 40min ride it wasn't too bad. There are trails u could walk, but I think the tram would cover more ground, and u need time to walk the trail, each is abt 20-30min, so plan your time here.

As the name suggests there were NO enclosures at all, animals literally walked across the tram path freely and as the path was quite narrow, you could get quite close with the animals if they grazed near the sides. Larger and more dangerous animals are probably separated by a ditch or something i think. The closeness u get w so many animals is something I never had before so this was pretty memorable for me.

Apart from the ride there was a Creatures of the Night animal shows at 1hour intervals. They were meh, can check it out if u have time.

Overall, worth coming once only.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:10:47.793627

Recently we all went again, this time with 3 teenagers in tow. The fun is still there. The sense of adventure still the same as the tram plunges into the darkness of the jungle.

It was wonderful to be so close to God's magnificent creatures. To see, to smell and to hear their squeaks, snorts and roar... awesome.

The safari folks did a wonderful job creating a sense of wildness and danger being so up close with the animals. When I saw the leopard turned and walked towards me... I was transfixed. Its eyes were so intense and it was so close, I couldn't move. I would have been eaten if not for the glass separating us... maybe not, but it certainly felt so at that time. That feeling was more exhilarating than the toughest ride in a theme park.

The best way to experience the park is to first take the tram and then walk around the park using its various trails. We made it to the mangrove cave where the free-flying bats soared. The brave ones in the family ventured in and were greeted by bats zooming around them. They conquered their fears... I am content to stand and watch.

Be prepared to give at least 3 hours for a good time in the park. Ours turned out to be a good workout. It was hot and humid but certainly worth it.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:10:49.856735

When you buy your tickets you have to book in an entrance time, make sure you get there at least 20 minutes (if not more) before that time as the line is huge. While waiting in line they put on a fire breathing show to the left so try and get as far left as possible if you want to see it. When you first get in it is better to go straight to the right and head down the path to do the animal show to get that out of the way first. The show was cancelled for us part way through as it started spitting rain. When we come out (and of course it stopped raining straight away) from that we went to go on the tram tour but as the line was too long we walked around some of the tracks instead. Cameras are useless as you aren't allowed to use a flash and there is very little lighting around the park but seeing the animals was great. We then went back to do the tram tour and the line was even longer but it does move fast! What looked like a line that would take over an hour only took about 20minutes so it is worth the wait.

Also the earliest entry we could buy was 2115-not a disaster as we needed to get something to eat and have a look around the gift shops .
We have been to the night safari around 5 times so we decided to try something new regarding food so went for the buffet . It was really good ($45/adult and $34/child).good quality and value.
Anyway due to the ridiculous queue arrangement to get in to the safari, we couldn't see the fire eating show at all!
The queue to get through the turnstiles would push anyone's patience !
Once in we decided to go for the night show rather than queue again for the tram but it was full. So queue more we did for the tram.
We did the tram, got back for the 2230 night show and it was full also! So end result was none of us saw the night show.
We did most of the walks which is a good, different experience -especially if you have family or friends visiting Singapore.

So recommendation ,if you are unable to book entry in advance , don't go up on at the weekend expecting to have a smooth entry and enjoyable entry experience !

The operator needs to do something because it never used to be like this , you bought your ticket and went in .

The trip was pre-booked with Tour East through Trailfinders, as part of our holiday package, which was a shrewd move as they are registered with the Singapore Tourist Board and this allowed us to jump the extensive queues. Our package also included a buffet dinner (Indian/Chinese) in one of the zoo's catering outlets, which was good if not quite as authentic as that available in Little India and Chinatown.

The safari is conducted on 'trams' - electric tugs pulling trailers (a bit Jurassic Park) with a recorded commentary in English. We came as close to the animals as you are ever likely to and I still can't work out why they weren't spooked as we drove through their enclosures. No flash photography means you need a top of the range camera to fully exploit the opportunity. Deer, cattle, buffalo, lion, tiger, elephant, giraffe, zebra, pigs, bear, hippo, tapir and rhino were all easily seen, up close and personal. The problem was that the journey was rushed. I'd have liked to have spent time observing the animals. We probably stopped for no longer than 10 seconds in each enclosure. So the tour concluded in 35 minutes or so. There is also a 'Meet the Animals' show, which we watched on a wide screen outside the amphitheatre, and there are some spectacular fire-eaters to keep the crowd in the queues occupied (we heard 2 hours in the queue can be expected at peak times). There's also the standard range of merchandising at the inflated norm for a Theme Park.

Overall I'd give it 4/5 spoilt by not being able to spend more time observing the animals.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:10:59.228091

It is dark so it would be difficult to see some of the animals but this is something the kids would enjoy.
The Creatures of the Night show is also something for the kids and the kids at heart.

There is no proper queuing system, no fans or aircons or water stations during this queuing experience.The tram experience is about 45 minutes long, the various regions which have clusters of animals are very poorly lit, hence trying to see them or to capture photos is near impossible. There are walking trails throughout the facility but, even on these trails, you cannot really get close to the animals to be able to see them in the dark. Even the lion and tiger feeding sessions are difficult to see let alone photograph. The Thumbuakar Show is at the entrance to the facility and is in a very poor location as it is a fire show for about 10 minutes of fire eating and blowing stunts. Difficult to view as it is not elevated and at ground height. The Creatures of the Night Show is about 20-30 minutes long, quickly filled, therefore, will have to stand in another queue for about 40 minutes. The show is nothing special. There are lots of food and beverage facilities which have a wide variety for all.
This is a tourist trap, very expensive for S$45 per person, no cheaper children pricing, waste most of the evening queuing in hot humid conditions to get in, get on the tram and to watch the 1 show. I will never recommend it to anyone. There are lot better tourist attractions in Singapore.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:11:14.277857

I should have arranged a separate day for Night Safari, with minimal activity planned prior to the visit.

The queue to enter was overwhelming. Buy tickets online, that will save time. But be prepared to stand in line as if you're entering a concert. It's packed, really packed. And I thought Sunday night will have less crowd. Once in you have the option to take the tram or walk on your own. We were too tired to walk so tram it is! Another queue for tram! One thing though, the crowd was organized although there were inconsiderate people cutting queues.

I don't think the zoo itself was anything interesting. You get to see probably more things by walking, but we didn't, it was too tiring with 2 young kids after the River Safari.

Food is expensive but taste good. We had dinner at Ulu Ulu restaurant... It's a for court with a variety of food, pricey though.

The opening fire show happens every hour from 7pm. Each show lasts 15 minutes, which is when the crowd is allowed to enter.

Again, if you have young kids, ensure they are well rested. The crowd is massive, the waiting is tiring. If you're on your own, go as late as possible.

Definitely no second visit for the next few years at least. Night Safari was a nightmare for us.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:11:14.631619

The night show is actually quite short compared to last few year when i went.
Do go there at 7.15 or 8.15 for sufficient time to roam around and in order to get back by bus, as their last bus is at 12.15am.
Do take the tram to zebra cafe and walk the trail ( map is given at the counter ) and then take the tram again to see more animals that are unable to see by walking.

We booked the Asian buffet dinner. It was fair priced and the food was generally delicious, better than I expected actually. However, they have arranged us to a non-air-conditioned dining area when there were seats inside. Yet, the one thing that really let us down was the dessert. There were flies surrounding them and ants crawling on the plate with cream puff. Disgusting!

Tram tour
We only got time to ride the tram and it was the most poor travel experience I have ever had. It was too dark to see anything and of course I understand that we must not disturb the animals but there must be something they can do to help us see right? Say like distributing infra-red devices? It was so boring that I actually fell asleep! However, what really angers me was its broadcasting system. It makes me feel like their whole preserving stuffs were SHAM and that they are only trying earn our money. It was their instruction to keep our volume low, but they just totally ignore their own rules and broadcast their introductions of animals loudly through their speakers on the tram!!! They should have totally used a headset system instead! Totally recommend not to visit.
P.S. The reason why we could only ride the tram was because the queue for the tram was so long! It totally reflects their poor management! Don't they know how to relieve congestion?

Design of the park
When we were riding the tram, 99.9% of the animals were on the right. So if you are like me, siting on the left, you are most likely done! That's is the very reason why I fell asleep, dark and nothing to see! What a poor design!",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:11:25.787090

Take a break there for some snacks then make your way to the wallaby trail & to the naracoorte cave. These attractions are new & worth visiting.

The animals were well kept but as it was dark could be difficult to see so there was a bit of luck involved, we did find ourselves looking into dark glass fronted enclosures seeing nothing, but I don't want to be negative as we did also see a lot of beautiful animals. We went on the tram tour at about 9pm when there were no queues at all. That was a welcome sit down and nice and cool. The tram took about 40 minutes and took you to the places that you couldn't walk to and we saw the larger animals like elephants, rhinos, giraffe etc. We left the safari about 10pm having a very refreshing fresh juice on the way out. My son was hungry and got a bongo burger which was over priced, the chips we cold and the burger was so hot it had definitely been heated up in a microwave - would not recommend a bongo burger, but the rest of the safari was good.

My family arrived with vouchers thinking we were locked in for a 7:15 PM running. Unfortunately, both the 7:15 and the 8:15 running shoes were sold out, so we waited in line for over an hour and got into the 9:15. It was worth it in the end when we saw lions, elephants, rhinos and hippos all in their nocturnal element, but hopefully you will heed this and avoid the hassle we faced.

Also, getting taxi out is a major pain. Unless you arrange a car independently, you will wait in line for about an hour to get a taxi.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:11:50.360788

The park is accessible through four walking trails that take you close to the enclosures at almost touching distance. These trails are designed as per the animals housed in that geographical region. The other way to see the animals in on the tram (separate ticket required) - some of the animals can only be seen by the tram as they don't figure on the walking trails. It is eerie in the beginning and thrilling... And then one gets used to it's one's eyes adjust. The walkways are well lit; the maps and directions on the property are clear; there are guides at check-points to help you out. The Creatures of The Night show is a must-see!
Note: reach at least one hour before opening time to secure early entry tickets. They let in people in three batches one hour apart 7:40,8:40 and 9:40pm - and as soon as you enter head for the Creatures of the night show and get that out of the way. The queues for entering into the park is huge!! So be there early. And then the queues for the tram is also lengthy... But a lot of the visitors just take the tram ride and they are lazy to do the trails so the queues become less. Ask the staff to guide you to plan your visit after you enter. They are very helpful.
Note: THERE IS NO DRINKING WATER FOUNTAIN OR RESTAURANT INSIDE THE PARK SO CARRY LOTS OF WATER. The restaurants are outside the park and they allow one to step outside with a re-entry stamp on the hand.
It is a fabulous experience.
Plan your visit in such a way that you do the zoo in the morning, then do the river cruise and finish off with night safari as they are all located at a stone's throw fro each other. Also going back again to see one attraction will become cumbersome and expensive taxi fare. There are unique combo tickets that combine all four parks - Jurong, zoo, night safari and river cruise.

11am to 3pm : zoo
3 to 5pm : river cruise

We saw 3 elephants together and they were trumpeting and making noises a bit like a whining child. As we drove further on, we could see a ranger moving towards the elephant enclosure so realised something was up. We left the tram and walked around the walking trails for a couple of hours. Before we left we decided to do the tram one more time to see if we could see some of the animals we had missed earlier. This time there were only two elephants, and they were quiet. The ranger explained that there were normally 3 elephants on the night safari but one had goven birth an hour or so before, we were stoked!!! It explained the noise that they had been making.
Clearly not going to happen for everyone, but in all honesty it is still well worth a visit, we heard the lions roaring, very eerie at night, and the leopard was asleep against the glass so we could virtually touch him.

I came because I managed to get a corporate pass for the evening. I'm glad I did not have to pay for the tickets as it would have been a total waste of money. It was a Friday evening and my family arrived at 7 pm. It was super crowded with very long queues. We managed to skip the queues because of the members pass but can imagine how awful it would have been if we had to go through those queues. The Creatures of the Night show was an embarrassment. After all the elaborate instructions nothing of interest other than the cute otter appeared. It ended abruptly and you can feel the ""huh that's it?!"" feeling in the audience. We tried the wallaby trail and tiger trail and managed to see two wallabies and a sleeping tiger. Oh yes a lots of sleeping pigs or babirusa as they call them. Thankfully we got up the tram halfway and that was quite an alright ride where we could see animals quite close. However they were mostly deer. The tapirs were quite interesting. The children enjoyed the tram ride. Overall I won't recommend this place. Stick with the zoo and river safari.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:12:26.349820

Apparently its getting popular with the masses. The 7:15 time is extremely crowded and takes about 30 mins to just enter the park. Inside, there's nothing exceptional. The team ride is about 40 minutes and more or less covers the whole area. I have done all of the walking trails too and they're pretty much the same but I would recommend wallaby trail if you want to do just one.
The creature of the night show used to be longer before, but they have cut it short. Also, its exactly the same jokes as it was 3 years ago. I think they need to keep innovating to keep it interesting for repeat audiences. The only thing I like watching over and over is the fire dance performance outside Bongos. It just doesn't get boring :)

Tips that might help:
1) You will get a 10% discount if you book night safari online, 30% discount if you book 2 or more park tickets and 50% discount if you book all 4 - zoo, night safari, river safari and river cruise.
2) If you prefer the 7:15 slot, book at least a day in advance. Specially if your planned date is on a Friday or Saturday.
3) The food around that area is unreasonable over-priced and bad. Eat before you come or you will shell out a lot of money only to be disappointed.
4) Check the weather forecast to see if its going to rain. They cancel the shows when it does, and the ticket is non-refundable.
5) If you want to take pictures, take a camera that can take photos without flash. In most of the places, flash photography is not allowed as it disturbs the animals.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:12:29.009162

also chose the 7:15 admission- and arrived by 7 so we could see the flame blowing show at the gates. Our kids were mesmerized by this.
We went for the tram right away thinking if we did not see a huge line we would wait- given we were the first admission group.
We were half way in the first set of waiting lines and so this was about a 20-25 min wait. They have many trams! Not bad and it got dark. What a great ride. It is crazy how close the animals are!!!

It was very crowded and could be a little more organised especially during entry process. As we wait with the crowd for the doors to open, the staff yelled and asked everyone to move forward and fill in the gaps. It was already tight enough and having a small child with you, makes it a little bit more uncomfortable. We thought the staff doesn't know how it feels like to be in the middle of a big crowd with many children and some elderly around. Its not safe to squeeze in whilst waiting.

We took a map at the entrance but found it useless. We didn't realise the tour is already planned. Each batch will queue, ushered to the night show, then rush back to a station to queue for trams. You can't help but rush because of the crowd. The host of the night show was very entertaining.

The tram ride was okay. The animals were present but 1 or 2 in each stop, except for the deers, otters, flamingos, cows and buffalos. I advise to bring mosquito repellant, fans and water for a more comfortable stay.

It was a different experience, that's for sure, but not necessarily a good one. I had no expectations of this whatsoever, so I was pretty open to whatever.

However, there were too many people (I guess it was a Sunday but what do you expect when you're only open a certain time of the day?). The tram's narrator did a good job of educating people about conservation and things like that, but the whole thing felt rushed, and if you're lucky, you'll actually see the animals moving. Most of them were just lying around and sleeping (or just resting). They were too far for you to get a good look, and you couldn't spend your time just looking, as you're in a moving vehicle.

Also, if it starts to rain, the show gets cancelled, which it did on our case, as our tour guide suggested we go to the 8:30PM showing since he noticed the lightning, and advised us to catch it in case it got cancelled. So, it did end up getting cancelled, with an ambiguous announcement that there might be a 9:30PM show if it stopped raining. If. Considering hours open, we couldn't help feel a little shortchanged. There were no contingency plans for weather conditions at all. We were supposed to go on the walking trek, but opted not to, as it started drizzling, and we didn't want to end up sick the next day.

Good intent, but a bad business model. Don't get me wrong, the staff was helpful and nice, but the impracticality of the whole situation was not worth it. Just go to a zoo where you can see the animals properly, and you don't need to crane your neck or squint your eyes trying to see in the dark (you're not nocturnal enough for that).",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:12:37.118772

To make it more hotter, there was a fire show that made my daughter cry. It was aweful as we were made to stand in lines for over an hour. We booked the 7.15 or 7.30 show. Later once we entered we were pushed into even more lines and queues. We were about to leave from this ordeal when we realised we were next to board the tram. There were tram delays and the staff was not cooperative.
Once in the tram, we saw animals but the tram was going too fast to notice them clearly. Especially the white lion which was the symbol of Singapore. The tram was moving very fast then. There were leopard trails and creatures of the night show, but we were exhausted from the shoving and the pushing that we avoided it.

I prepaid online for six persons, waited for 30 minutes from a designated pick up point, only to call the company and be told that the 6:00pm, 6:15pm and 6:30pm buses were full and that we had to catch a taxi. Lucky I expressed my displeasure at their lack of service and I got a refund of $60SD for two taxis. The trip home was the same experience. There was no 10:00pm, 10:15pm or 10:30pm shuttle as advertised on their website. We ended up paying $60SD on the return trip, not refunded the SAEx. By 11:00pm with two young children and two seniors we were too tired and hot to argue with the company. Please note, the SAEx service is recommended by Night Safari on their website. DO NOT USE SAEx for any travel around Singapore.

As for the park. It was difficult to redeem my Singapore City Pass, and I was shuffled around to different lines only to be serviced 30 minutes by the first attendant I approached. The fire show was slightly entertaining. The tram ride around the park was ok but it was driven fairly quickly. There was a lot of pushing and shoving happening at the tram line which my young kids found scary. The show is not worth seeing. More talk than showcasing animals, in actual fact they only bring out 4-5 animals. The bird show at Taronga Zoo, Sydney is significantly better. The merchandise was astronomically priced.

The shows are great. If going you want to get there for around 7pm.

Most visitors will take be tram around which I would highly recommend for sure, but if you allow enough time, the walking trails offer some things you won't see from the tram that are well worth the extra effort to get to.

While not the big draw items like the leopards and tigers, my favourite of all here is the fruit bat enclosure. Getting so close and having them fly around you in the night is really special.

Which is best, Singapore Zoo, night safari, river safari or bird park? I would have to say the Singapore Zoo, however, the night safari is truly unique and something very different to experience. You shouldn't miss it.",11-2015,Family,2020-01-30 15:13:13.357700

This was a nice little trip through the rain forest. The park is small but cute. There are two shows, one is large, with some animals who do small tricks, and the other is very small, a fire dancing show which was located right at the entrance. I was a little disappointed by the shows, but overall, the safari/tram ride seeing the animals up close made the trip worth while!!

We were travelling with two older ladies, one of which was in a wheelchair, and the park (including tram ride) was easily manageable.

We were two families with young kids, and one of the attendants noticed that our party was outnumbered by the kids (4adults, 5young kids), and very kindly fast tracked us to the priority area of the tram queue. Really appreciated that kind gesture.
Kudos to the gelato shop at the park's entrance. Was close to midnight n the shop was closing (I think they'd shut down the cash register when we got there). Yet they very kindly ""re-open"" to serve us when our kiddos wanted gelato. They got to entertain a few other customers after us in the process
Because we drove in with a foreign registered car, upon leaving the park we went to enquire about topping up our Autopass to pay for car park. We were told that facility is not available on site, and we actually had to purchase a car park ticket from the park itself. As the park's ticketing system had been shut down for the night at the time we made the enquire, the service staff very graciously presented us with a complimentary parking ticket to resolve our problem! To top it off, as we were just about to exit the car park, we realised we had dropped and lost our Autopass!

The team ride is a nice way to see all the animals but the highlight of the zoo is the Creatures of the Night show. I would suggest you do not kiss this especially if you have young children as it is a chance for them to see some cute animals up close and learn a bit more about them.

It's on late so have to stay up late, kids enjoyed it. You sit on the shuttle bus which takes you round. It's not very long but you do get to see the animals. If limited for time skip this and just do the zoo which is excellent.

There is a fire show before hand. The food is slightly better here.",05-2015,Family,2020-01-30 15:13:42.108148

It was almost for an hour and a half we had to keep standing in the longest queue ever. We went on a saturday evening. First there was a long queue for getting entry to the park. After around half an hour, we were finally able to enter the park. We then headed for the live animal show which was great. Various animals performed various activities with the instructors and it was all fun. It lasted for around half an hour. Then we headed to board the tram for the actual safari. The wait of around 1.5 hours in the hot and humid environment was real pain. Though they have some wall fans installed at various points but it was hardly any relief. Finally we got the chance to board the tram and the jungle safari started. It went along its predefined path covering various wild animals. Since it is all dark, dont bother taking photographs of the animals. Instead just have the pleasure of watching them and enjoy. It was a small ride of around 25 minutes. There is also a restaurant which seemed overpriced. Overall, it was a good experience which could have been much better had there been no queues.",08-2015,Family,2020-01-30 15:13:42.485785

Tips for visitor:
1. They have a fire show in the beginning ( 30 minutes before the gate opens) which you can enjoy
2. You might have to assemble an hour before and occupy seats outside. You can grab some barbecued meat. I am a vegetarian so have less idea

It was difficult getting him out of bed in the mornings and would end being cranky the whole day so to enjoy the holiday I decided to compromise and do things after lunch.
I usually do everything myself but but as the zoo was quiet far off from the hotel and the return was at night I opted to go with a tour company. We went with Tour East.
Got picked at the hotel, taken to China Town where they had a cashier kiosk. After the payment was made got put into a bus to go to the zoo.
The guide was funny and informative. Once we got there the guide went to get our tickets and we had a quick toilet rush. Facilities are very clean.
He handed us our tickets and got us into the tram for the safari.
After the safari we watched the "" Creatures of the Night "" , it was entertaining. Not any wow factor from the animals but fun to watch. This was approximately 20-25 mins and we left the amphitheater.
We were left to do the night trail, but my son was too tired and scared as it is pretty dark.
Saw a 2 min fire show--- it's nothing but a guy blowing fire --- seriously that's all it is but the children were impressed.
Had dinner which was obviously overpriced and this is norm for such places, no surprise here.

The night tram ride was the best as you get to cruise around the zoo, it was cooling and at some points the tram will pass by deers, wild pigs and some other four legged friends wandering freely.

The bat enclosure was another highlight as bats were flying freely above you and across you. It was exhilarating to say the least.

With the other tracks, animals were really adorable doing about their own things probably thinking 'who are these people?'

I still love the novelty of going to a zoo at night - and seeing the animals in a different light (or lack thereof) compared to what you see during the day. That said - I think its time for the zoo to either expand a bit (particularly on the tram ride) - or maybe refresh the exhibits so that there is more to look forward to on repeat trips. That said - I think that the park is basically being run as a novelty type attraction - grab the tourists once - and no need to focus on the repeat customers.

On this trip - we arrived around 8:45 p.m. - and the lines were very long and slow to take the tram ride. In terms of loading the trams - they were very inconsistent. Some of the staff allowed parties of two to have their own bench seat on the tram - while in our case (and many others) we were overloaded on our seat (thanks to some extra large guests on our seat) and our knees and shoulders were crammed in to make sure we all remained in the tram. When it's steamy and hot - you don't want to be in this position!

The exhibits were great - although the Bengal tigers are looking very bored - and I suspect animal rights experts would say that they need more enrichment as the 15 minutes we were with the tigers all they did was pace back and forth in the same place in front of the glass window - which is far from normal behavior - even in a zoo environment. To make sure you see everything - including all aspects of what you see in the trolley - it is worth your time walking on the multiple paths. Not only do you see some great Asian animals you won't see in your home zoo - but you can get much closer to the animal enclosures on the tram path - and can notice much more of what's going on with the animals in the areas of the enclosures not visible on the tram.

As usual with all things Singapore - the park is clean, the staff were friendly, and while I think the cost is a bit high for the number of animals they are actually exhibiting, you are paying a premium for the night experience. It's definitely worth it for the first time Night Safari goer - a little less so for the repeat visitor.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:14:17.478649

The staff appeared to be prepared for this and we were moved on to another area where we watched a live animal demonstration that lasted around 20 minutes.  The show was actually entertaining but did feature some trained animals which might offend a few  people.  In my view this isn't exploitation and we should bear in mind this zoo donates money to various animal aid and research projects around Asia.
So the show finished and we found ourselves back in a Disney land style queue for our tram which we finally boarded an hour after our ticketed time.
I hope this information is useful,  basically there's no point in getting here early and don't worry if you are late. It doesn't seem to matter to the zoo what time your ticket is booked for and it doesn't get checked.  As I say a bit chaotic really but all will work out in the end , but be prepared for some standing and waiting.  The tour around the zoo by tram , is wonderful and quite different to what you will see in the daytime. There are also 2 optional self guided walks.
 We actually did the day visit and a night safari but if you have limited time then we would suggest the night safari as it's a unique experience.  Bear in mind unless you have a night vision camera you won't be able to take photos!",03-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:14:18.505027

There's no point actually queuing early as once inside, you still have to queue for the safari tour if you want to do it right away. About 15 mins before the door opens, there is a side show with some flame-tossing which is quite neat (but you can also catch that on your way out).

We lined up for the safari tour which took around 30mins wait-time And the tour itself was around 30 mins , then had some food near the entrance (highly recommend the Korean Galbi beef rib set!) and then went back in for the walking tour, rejoining the safari tram at station 3 for the second time.

In future, we would probably start with the walking tour which is to the left of the tram line (fishing cat and leopard tour) for a more leisurely start and then catch the safari ride at Train Station 3 mid-way and then do the rest via tram.

Content was very lacking in substance and originality. Same old routine of getting a child volunteer to hold a piece of food for animals which virtually all zoos or similar places also do. Next was the boring routine of putting a snake around the neck of another volunteer and make him do a macho man pose. This procedure is repeated in so many zoos (not sure who is copying who). Getting the otters next to pick and throw objects into bins is highly similar to what they do during the day zoos around the world.

Firstly go during the week as it is less crowded.
No need to arrive early. Its open until late. Once the first rush has passed at 7.30 with people queing from around 6.45 it is much quiter. I would suggest going at 8pm or after.
Take the tram ride around the park and the ranger tells you all about the animals. This is a 40 min journey. I would then do the walk through the parts that you dont see from the tram. You can also spend time looking at some of the animals for a longer period.
I personally didnt think the animal show was worth the effort. It was very hot and uncomfortable and a good part of the show was telling people not to use flash cameras. This of course was totally ignored by quite a few people.
The food was very nice but very expensive. If you dont eat before you go then i suggest you have your meal before you do the walking trails. Its much more atmospheric after dark.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:14:54.313897

It's the only place in the world that I've been to, to view nocturnal animals up close. Trams are available to take visitors around the Safari. The Safari is very well-spaced and the animals are certainly very well cared for. The environment is lush and full of greenery. Visitors can visit the Singapore Zoo and River Safari during the day as they are in the same vicinity and then proceed with the Night Safari.

Not worth to visit at peak seasons due to the crowd and duration/ time of waiting for the ride might be up to 1-2hrs. If you have small kids or elderly with you, I suggest you come on another day to prevent the kids from throwing tantrums or your parents standing there for hours waiting for the ride. Everything's selling at Night Safari is not cheap includes of foods and drinks. Make sure you don't go there with empty stomach!

Might be a little difficult to see certain animals due to the darkness and visitors are not allowed to feed or provoke the animals during the ride. The tickets itself quite costly and very hot while you are in the queue due to the crowd and the amounts of people's visiting during school holidays.

It might be a bad day or bad timing to go on raining season as you might get wet and the walking patch might be slippery after the rain. Thus, walk carefully and held your parents and kids to prevent from any unwanted injuries. Flash light is not allowed while using camera, taking picture with your hand phone as this might trigger the animals or causing harm to the ur eyesight due to sudden flash from your device.",04-2015,Family,2020-01-30 15:15:02.034443

I was very excited so on recommendation I booked with a tour company. I was told from a few people if you go by yourself you could end up waiting 2 hours in line but you are guaranteed a time slot with a tour company. To be honest it was all very rushed. We went to an animal show first which was very poor. The presenter spoke most of the time and we only saw 3 animals in the 30 minute show. The safari itself which lasted 45 minutes was interesting but not great. We did walk around the trails a bit and we thought that was better. We were all a bit disappointed to be honest.

I bought a membership pass as I knew I would have visitors to Singapore. I took friends and family, and they all loved it!

Book online in advance using a mastercard and get 10% off, use a Singaporean card and get 15% off! You also avoid the need to queue for tickets.

People will queue for ages to ride on the tram the whole way round the park, but you only need to do that for the non-pedestrian bit (to see the elephants, roaming deer, white lions etc.).

Take your time to see the animals close up…deer, birds, bats, slow loris…

OK, some of the animals aren’t nocturnal, but seeing them at night is still pretty cool. There aren’t many other places where you can do that. The show isn’t amazing, but still worth going to!

Try and go midweek as the weekends are particularly busy, and DON’T do it in a tour group – they rush you through, and you ruin it for everyone else!",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:15:04.308067

Read more Tips in this review!!,"Our Experience: We had booked tickets online and since the 7.15 slot was booked we could get in through thee 8.15 slot.. due to this we had to wait outside for a really long time and it was actually time wasted.. when we went in finally we saw the creatures of the night show first.. then went on the tram ride.. since we were travelling with senior citizens we skipped the trail walks as they were not very comfortable with that.. but i guess it wud have been a good experience..

TIPS:
1. There are 3 Aspects to this attraction.
a. Creatures of the night show - it is a stage show where different nocturnal animals perform.
b. Tram ride - it is a 20mins ride through the conservatory showing u different animals and along with very interesting information.
c. Trail walks - in this u have to just walk around by urself in the conservatory and see the animals along the trails..
2. Make sure u book an early slot online or contact some travel agency or something..because i noticed that almost all of the people who were in the early slots were wearing batches of various travel agencies..
3. If u think the Tram ride line is massive dont waste ur time there just move to the creatures of the Night Show. The tram ride lines get smaller as the night goes along so u will get a shorter wait time.
4. it is advisable to keep the trail walks as the last activity there so that u can take a peaceful stroll in the moon light watching all the animals that u come across in the trails.Unless ur scared of the dark or u feel uneasy to walk the trails so late at night.
5. It is extremely important that u select ur day to visit this place when ther weather forecast is not showing rains or thunderstorms.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:15:10.156081

I came here yesterday for my birthday (I'm 22 now) and it was absolutely incredible. As someone who loves animals, seeing the creatures up close and in action was beyond anything. We started at 9.15pm, witnessing a super cool fire show as we were queuing up. We started of with the 'creatures of the night' show, which was really fun with lots of cute animals. The ONLY thing about the show was that they only picked volunteers of Caucasian appearance (I didn't stand a chance to participate ): ) . The place was mighty crowded but we did the walking trail, which was fair more relaxed and empty.
I spent a long time marveling at and appreciating the majestic creatures, just in awe of their natural beauty. I had never seen hyenas, lions, hogs, deers, porcupines, otters, civets, rhinos and all the different cats at such a distance. They all looked super healthy and happy and the enclosures looked well-fitted with lots of vegetation and space.
A thing that was annoying were tourists that kept shining their flashes at the animals to get a better look, and banging on the glass and making lots of noise to encourage the animals to be more active. I think more keepers are required in some of the areas to control the tourists better.

I walked half the trail and took the tram to see the bigger animals (zebra, giraffe, indian wolves etc), but this was only due to time constraints as I had spent 2 hours doing 3 trails. I recommend arriving at the Night Safari at 7pm and walking the entire park to get the full experience. The hyenas were my absolute favorite and I wished I had been walking for that part since the tram only stopped by for a minute. I would have watched them play forever.

Overall, it was an incredible experience for an animal lover like me and I would do it 10 times again.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:15:31.379467

My children both under 10 enjoyed the ""fire"" show with the Thumbuakar ""warriors"". Do NOT go in thinking that this is as dramatic as what you might see in Hawaii as entertainment at a luau. It's just enough to keep the kids at this age entertained for 15 minutes. We also attended the Creatures of the Night show.

After the Tour I sent the email copied below and the company did not even bother responding to me.

Subject: Night Safari Tour with SH Tours

Dear Madam/Sir

My family and I have just returned from the Night Safari Tour we embarked today at 18:00, and I thought I would write you an email of our experience and disappointment of the experience we have had of your company's tour.

Firstly, your tour guide was not friendly at all. From the time of meeting we were just merely numbers on her list. In fact she allocated numbers to us (which I found strange because that is so impersonal). I can't tell you what her and is as she never introduced herself to us.

Secondly, we paid your company $59 per person and we are a family of 5. So this was a tour we were willing to pay money for but in return we had an expectation of a relaxing evening with the family.

It turned out anything but relaxing. From the time we departed your tour guide insisted that we rushed off the bus as soon as we departed, that we not stop for any bathroom stops etc. we headed the call with an understanding that as a group we cannot waste too much time.

But really it was a complete rush from one event at the night safari event to the next. We did not manage to even go to the bathroom. We just managed to buy some ice cream cups and were at the coach at 9:15. Since we couldn't eat on the bus the tour guide advised us to eat up (and not in a good tone). Actually the tone was extremely pushy and irritable.

I told my family that we have 15 mins as we were told that we were going to depart at 9:30. But a few minutes after we got at the coach your tour guide was screaming and performing for us to hurry up.

There were a couple of other passengers who got there at 9:27 and was scolded for being late. At which point at least 3 passenger groups started complaining of the treatment of your tour guide's behavior and attitude towards your patrons. She then advised that the bus is not allowed to stop for long periods as it is just a pick up zone and in fact that she was doing us a favour by getting the coach to stop at the parking bay marked Number 3!

After the altercation with the passengers your tour guides response was that if we were unhappy we should arrange to go visiting the night safari by ourselves!

I ask you why the bus arriving too many minutes too early be an issue we should be burdened by? Is this really what your company represents- that we we feel we are not treated well then we can choose not to use your company and make our way there ourselves?

It is very unlikely that we will be using your company again. It's just a pity that our 1st day in your beautiful country has left is feeling soo unwelcome. We have just arrived from 2 weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia and got the friendliest most awesome service and I suppose we were presumptuous in thinking that we could expect the same or better service in Singapore.

For what it's worth, I write to you hoping that other visitors to Singapore will not experience what we did.

I wish they had kept more shows to cater to everyone since it was overly crowded.
Secondly since kids wanted to see the animals again we went on tram which we caught at 10 30 and the animals weren't even visible as they had all gone quite far, so whoever was on the tram for the first time sadly, didn't get to see most wild life.

There are trams which take visitors around the park, the staff are very helpful providing preferential treatment to families who have wheelchairs and/or prams.

The only advise I would provide is that if you would like to take one of the several walking routes around the Night Safari be careful if you have a wheelchair as there are a few hills. The paths are designed for wheelchairs but one or two of the hills are steep.

Likes
Sightings from the comfort of your tram. With tropical heat, a walk through the zoo in the morning could be too much for some. This is a a more relaxed alternative.
There is an air of drama.
Very proffesionally managed, as is the case with all attractions in singapore.

Dislikes
The queue was long , and this was a working day. We were in the queue for about 45mins, though it kept moving.
The species in display were not more impressive than what we get to see in a well maintained indian zoo(Mysore,Bhuvaneswar). In fact they were less versatile than the good indian zoos. However the way it is presented to the tourists is very impressive...But then again you pay ten times the entry fee you would pay in an indian zoo.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-30 15:16:05.695375

It was stormy, traffic was slow so we arrived just in time to enter. There was no guidance as to what to do, just huge lines moving forward. We ended up on the live for your groups and had to go all the way to the back again.

Once through the turnstiles, another huge line for the tram. The show was cancelled due to the weather. In all it took us close to an hour to get on the tram, again dealing with people trying to push their way further up the line.

The tram trip was ok, lots of looking at very little and the passing by some animals, but really too quickly to go more than glimpse them.

We then walked around the trails, again lots of nothing. Quite a few enclosures were too dark to see anything and in others the animals were hiding. Can have a much better experience at zoos in other cities.

Shows were running by this time, but we're always full, and the last one was too late for the safari gate bus. So missed out. Finished the night with an overpriced drink.

Returning on the safari gate bus was an experience. Open air double decker, which seemed to drive too fast and totally impractical on a stormy night.

It felt like the zoo has massively oversold tickets and were unable to deal with the crowds. Given the tickets are timed, they should only be selling tickets up to the amount of people they can reasonably deal with. The entry staff were rude and unhelpful.

Never mind, with a fresh outlook, we awaited the night safari. we experienced the Thumbakum fire dance- which was entertaining for 5 mins, and then emitted a lot of kerosene based effluents in the air, not to mention the smoke pollution. Sat in our trams for 30 mins, and saw the animals- in their habitats, placid and happy.

There are four walking path areas where you follow a paved path past and through animal enclosures. The animals are all nocturnal so are most but not in all cases active. Each Area and exhibit has dim lighting and once your eyes adjust you can them well.

There is a ride on open sided team which weaves through the park driving past many exhibits but this is not so fun as walking yourself, because the tram moves fast and you don't always get to see thing as well as you like plus the tram has an annoying voice commentary which for me s bit patronising. Still it's a good thing to do to get a overview of the park.

This delay meant we didn't get to see the shows, try the walking tours or feeding of the animals as we'd run out of time.

The larger animals also seemed bored - it's difficult to make out the enclosure size / stimulants - in the dark but their behaviour left us a bit worried.

The guide spoke English but not clearly enough so we missed alot. They had no customer service ethic. There was no apologies and we were thrown together in queues that had no system or logic.

It is far from the city so give yourself about 30 minutes or so. If the party is about 4 definitely take a taxi (approximate fare would be 20- 25 dollars.
The crowd was huge. A word of advice would be either book online or if visiting the zooo or bird park before get a multicday park hopper ticket. This would save a lot of time.
My suggestion is to take food with you as there is precious little time. If possible grab the night creature show and then go for the tram ride. If lucky you will finish around 10 pm and can see the fire show. The tram ride is Ok most animals are deers, types of Buffalo etc. The interesting animals were the lion, tiger and elephant.

Only thing is that tickets needs to be booked in advance and it should be with tram car ride as it is next to impossible to walk the entire safari. The tram ride takes around 40 mts and the tickets for entry is at 19.15 and 20.15. Secondly a pick up and drop is required as it is some distance away and in the night buses might not be available .

I asked for one adult and one over 60 concession but was told that the concessions were only available to Singapore residents! This is clearly a zoo policy - at other attractions such as The Botanic Gardens, Maritime Museum, Asian Civilisation museum, Indian Heritage museum etc etc we were invited to make use of the concessionary rates.
So, after paying $57 each (over £30 each) we were told that the next block entry would be at 8.15pm - a wait if around 2 hours with nothing on offer other than shopping or eating.
After queuing at our allotted time we decided to do the walking trails first as the line for the tram was very long. The trails were enjoyable and we got to see a lot of animals in their nocturnal states.
We then queued for the tram ( the walking trails do not cover all the enclosures). Quite a long wait made longer by staff bringing several rows of people behind us forward!
The tram ride was enjoyable and informative.
The zoo says it supports wildlife conservation indeed the tickets tell us that for every $57 ticket sold they donate 50cents to conservation.

We had an awfully long wait and there was NOWHERE to sit. In the blistering heat we had no choice but to buy drink after drink to stay cool and have something to do in the meantime, which was walk round & round - there is a performance that takes place on the stage near the bar - but I couldn't tell you what it was as you cannot see through the crowds, I assume it was fire breathing or something similar perhaps due to the smell of smoke and spirit.

The place is RAMMED. There are simply endless people walking at / around you.

The organisation of (or lack of) for entry through a ""flash your ticket"" system is dire and means that people flock to the available staff - usually two - to show their ticket and start queuing. Once you get through this bit you then queue to go through and queue again for the transport. This is chaotic, busy and there is lots of queue jumping. It's highly annoying and terribly organised so be prepared!

Having said that, once you are in and on your way, it's actually lovely but again, be prepared for the ignorant tourists who choose to talk so loudly that you can miss the whole audio element of the tour.

You need a really good camera for pics and once you start your own tour by foot it is great. We also did the Rainforest Lumina at the end of the night, which was absolutely wonderful and much quieter.

Overall, it's fairly well priced but the lack of organisation and facilities was a let down. If you go as a family, with an elderly person or a person who is less able bodied then you will struggle here - before entry particularly.

Staff are lovely and most helpful - our phones ran out of power whilst we waited - but just a shame that a lack of organisation can be enough to put you off before you even begin.",07-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:17:23.244393

So we queued to take the tram around the park. We ended up in a tram filled with very loud, rude and disrespectful people, which totally ruined the experience. After 20 minutes of getting increasingly annoyed, we got off the tram and did the walking trails around the park. This was much nicer and quieter. The park is only dimly lit, so there were a lot animals that we didn’t see as it was too dark. You do get a nice feeling of walking in a moonlit park. When we walked all the trails, we went on the tram again. This time there were no queues and only 10 people in the tram. Which made for a very good experience, we could clearly see the animals on both sides of the tram and hear the recording with information on the animals and the park. This was at about 9.45pm.

to me
4 minutes agoDetails
Let me start by saying I love animals and enjoyed a day at the Singapore Zoo - not so the Night Safari.
Like a lot of good ideas, this one appears to have been hijacked by greed for inordinate profit.
Was it a peaceful, engaging, educational experience? NO Was it more like a crowded shopping mall? YES. Was it worth the money? NO
Having read reviews about long queues, we arrived at 6:30 for 7:15 time slot (bought on line). As you enter the park, the music blaring and shops give you the idea you are entering a ""Gold Coast"" style theme park, not a place to quietly encounter animals. By chance we were ushered to a new queue so were able to get on the first tram at 7:05 but I noted lots of people waited heaps longer. The tram ride was ineffective - instead of the driver having the ability to stop and spend time where the animals are visible, he is forced to keep going to fit in with the tacky pre-recorded commentary- why? Because just behind is another packed tram…..and another one…..(Note the tram commentary is not live as stated on the official website)

I had hoped walking the trails might be moe enjoyable, but alas….many of the enclosures are very small and lots of the animals appear bored or distressed. The most distressing species however was the humans - the park seems to be packed with people racing around (mostly with screaming kids) noisily calling to each other when they spot an animal, taking photos with their phones (I wonder how many of them turned out in the dark) and then racing off after a few seconds. I found myself telling a few people to be quiet and turn off their camera flashes, because no one else was. In fact some of the tour guides were the worst offenders. In the end I gave up. By the time we had fought the crowds back to the Creatures of the Night section it was full, so I can't comment on that.

As I left, I read a notice that the park welcomes 1.3 million visitors a year, but I am not sure that is an achievement to boast about. The only way I can see this place improving is if visitor numbers are restricted and staff are visible and willing to regulate people's behaviour. In the mean time don't waste your money. Spend it at the mall instead - at least you will come home with something.",08-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:17:41.152335
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/MRS616,703108122,26-08-2019,4,Really worth doing - don’t believe the critics,"I had a very limited time schedule in singapore and after reading reviews here I almost didn’t do this because there were so many negatives. However friends who live in singapore told us it was a must see and gave us tips on missing the crowds. It was really worth doing but I think it is worth reading the following tips:

Tips:
1. It takes a long time to get here on public transport (this Is surprisingly information that isn’t emphasised anywhere I found). If you are planning to do the MRT to ang mo kio and then the bus there, it does go straight to the doors but the bus ride is quite long (and it’s a public bus so it stops multiple times on the way). It takes around 35-40 minutes on the bus (in light traffic) so be aware of this and factor an hour total travel time if doing the above. I personally would just take a taxi if I went next time (a “grab” taxi from the city will cost around 18-20 dollars). We took a standard taxi home (to novena area) and it cost around 35 bucks, grab is much cheaper (Uber equivalent in singapore which is pretty good).
2. GO LATER (perhaps aim to arrive between 2000-2100, go watch sunset first somewhere else) and aim to do the tram ride later when most people have gone. We had this advice from friends and basically we took the last tram ride (2215) and the queue was minimal (maybe 10 minutes). Friends have said definitely don’t queue up for the tram rides before 2100 as it is packed (note queuing is the cause of most of the negative reviews).
3. If you decide to go a bit earlier than 2100 then do all the walking trails FIRST and then the tram ride later. There are a lot of great animals you won’t see on the tram at all, and you will see much closer up and have time to appreciate including tigers and leopards. Also on the tram there are animals that you don’t see but then I ended up seeing on the walking tracks (eg. I saw the lions and the leopard which I missed on the tram). Factor around an hour at least to do the walking tracks at pace, more if you want to dawdle and read all the info etc. I think it’s actually more enjoyable than the tram....
4. The tram ride is not that enjoyable, as it is ruined by Chinese tourists talking loudly and incessantly so you can barely hear the commentary. Also the commentary is a real Disney style pre-recorded blurb, it’s sad they don’t choose to have the driver do a live commentary. There are a few (not that many) areas that you won’t get to see on walking tracks though, so it is still worth doing.

So in conclusion it’s a really good experience and you see some great animals - just take my advice and
- arrive later
- do walking tracks first and tram after to avoid huge queues for tram
- factor at least 2 hours for the whole visit
- factor in an hour to get there if using public transport (I would take a grab taxi!)",08-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:17:41.523849

When we reached the night safari, we were basically ""forced"" into seeing the most ridiculous show which included 30min of waiting, 30min of safety briefing and at most 30min of seeing in total 5 unspectacular animals (e.g. owls).

2. Then we took the little train to see the actual zoo. However, the train did hardly stop at all, so it was not possible to really see and observe animals at nighttime.

3. We decided it is best to walk through the park by ourselves. We had only walked for 15mins when they approached us to hurry up and walk back the way we had come from as the park was closing.

As there is basically no public transportation at night, we had to spend another fortune on a cab to the center.

After we came out of the show, we had to wait 45 minutes for the tram.

Luckily we had done just that. We had got a taxi to the zoo, a fair way out of central Singapore - not bad value at 25 dollars, although cheaper shuttle bus and other travel options are available.

Having seen the huge queues for the teams which drive people around the zoo, we opted to tackle the visit on foot. I think this was worthwhile, as it seemed to get us much closer to a number of enclosures. There were a few ups and downs but it was not a long walk.

There were a few Jurassic Park moments during our walk, arriving at enclosures and not being able to see any sign of the animal it was supposed to house, but not too many and the big animals - lions, tiger and crocodiles were all out and about when we arrived - we were also lucky enough to witness the feeding of the lion (9pm) and tiger (9:30pm). Other animals included wallabies, deer, flying foxes (open enclosure), warthogs, various exotic cats and porcupine.

As far as zoos go, they appeared to offer relatively generously sized enclosures, although they could always be bigger. The animals we saw all looked very healthy and well cared for.

Firstly it is a very long way. Unless you have a car, take the metro about half an hour out of town, then a bus the last 25km from the nearest metro station. Then pay your $55 (slightly cheaper if you buy online), queue until your allotted entry time, then queue again for the tram ride. This takes you around the park for 40 mins to see the animals. There are lots of deer, a few elephants, a couple of lions and various others. Mildly interesting but nothing you can’t see in any other zoo. There’s a cheesy ‘creatures of the night’ show with about 6 or 7 trained animals - barely worth sitting through the ridiculous welcome spiel (« Are you all having a great time? I can’t hear you!

We finally start our journey through the park and saw a lion, a tiger, some elephants and a few pigs and antilope type. They recorded audio explaining all the time the animals we should be seeing but because of their camoflauge and dislike of light and noise, we might find it difficult to spot them. Really! That would have been good to know before hand. Once the tram ride of about 33 minutes finished, we walked the various tracks to see more of the displays. Again we were disappointed by not being able to see most of the animals. There is also a show where they bring out some animals. This is short but ok.

We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:

1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;
2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.
3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.

On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms. Bring your refillable water bottles to stay hydrated in the sticky heat and try and do your part to not contribute to increase plastic consumption.",07-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:18:05.418519

had no time to eat, had to line up, to line up again, to then have people push in front of you anyway? what's the point of the line?
because there is so many people the workers push half the crowd to the trams and half to the show. show was packed to the brim, animals were seen for about 5 seconds each except for the owls and the snake. we had one lady in front of us, who after told many times to remain seated, still stood and filmed the entire show, was told to sit 3 times including from one of the keepers in the show, while doing the show, who had an owl on her arm at the time!!!!! unbelievable.
after the disappointing show (not the fault of the animals whatsoevet), we made our way towards the humongous lines to the trams to get around the zoo. last straw was people pushing, to the point my partner had someone literally put their hands on his back and push him out the way to get infront of him.

Dont do it with a tour group as you dont get long enough to do any of the walks. It would have been great a few years ago but now there are just too many people and the queues are unbelievable. Theres not much seating unless you are in one of the restaurants. We did a combined tour of River and Night Safari but they dont tell you that you have a couple of hours to kill between safaris where there is nothing to do but sit in the heat. It was a very long day and we wouldnt do it again.,06-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:18:17.159026

We booked our tram ride/night safari through a third party and thats where the confusion started. On arrival we were amazed at how busy the entrance was (forgot it was a Saturday night).
The QR code does not give you entry, you still need to get a ticket. Booking time was also nit what we thought.
Waiting in line was unpleasant, super crowded.
Our patience finally ran out and we skipped the tram ride and did our own thing walking the pathways.
Viewing the animals was amazing though i am sure the Tram Ride would only provide a much more limited sample.
As i said, i would love to give a better review but by Singapore standards this was very disappointing.",06-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:18:17.484171

I have visited many times since its opening and I don't think it's as good as it used to be. The Creatures of the Night show featured lots of animals but the one I saw didn't feature the surprise snake which was a shame. The automated voice now on the tram is a real disappointment because other guests don't respect and listen to it like they used to when it was a human speaking and sharing their knowledge. The walking trails have changed as well and I miss the Bridge of Suspense. The Night Safari is still a great evening out, but some small changes I think have meant it's not as good as it used to be.",04-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:18:23.342100

The tram was also very informative and we got very close to some free roaming animals which was unexpected and lovely to experience. All the animals seem to be well looked after and have relitively good size enclosures from what we could see.

The zoo reopens at 7pm, after closing at 5pm daily to prepare for the night safari. Upon arrival we took a 45 minute tram ride around the zoo, viewing the animals at a time when they are naturally most active. Enjoy seeing the animals with the naked eye rather than through a view finder as camera flashes are not permitted and the tram driver does not slow down long enough for your camera to focus. I wasted the first 20 minutes of the ride trying to sort out cameras but it is not worth the hassle. Enjoy the view on the tram as there is plenty of time later on, while walking through the trails, to take photos of the amazing animals. After the tram ride is a show in the amphitheater, showcasing some of the animals in the zoo. The staff continually ask everyone present to not use camera flashes and to not touch or attempt to touch the animals. People still tried to touch the animals but thankfully no one used a camera flash. After the show you will get the opportunity to walk the trails, at your own pace, to view the animals. Here, you can take your time, watch the animals at your leisure and take photos of these animals. This walk is the best part of the Night Safari and is a must if you want a better view.
There are a number of food outlets at the entrance of the zoo and it's best to eat prior to entering.

We didn't go round on foot but that looked amazing. You don't need to be on a tour for this as far as I could see and I expect that you would get a lot out of the night zoo if you did both the foot trails and the tram

We flew from England and arrived in Singapore early evening but this was the only time that we would be able to visit the safari so we booked a taxi and off we went and so very glad that we did! Not only was this the best time to go, approx 8 pm - 9 pm at night, but it was quiet and we managed to do everything.

We did see most of the animals, the key to this is going later at night, when it is quiet, patience, a good eye and most of all keeping very quiet, and if needs be asking other tourist to be quiet, it really does affect what you will see!

After doing the 'walk through' section of the safari we boarded the tram again, no ques just straight on. There is a huge waiting area for people to wait for the trams so I imagine at busy times this could be quite a problem.

The tram safari again did not disappoint it was absolutely brilliant!

I would go back in a heartbeat.

One last thing avoid weekends, unless getting there late as locals often take their children and we were told this is the worst time to visit. I also recommend visiting at night as most of the animals in the 'walk through' section are nocturnal and of course will not be seen during the day. During the night special 'moon lights' are on throughout the walking area so you can actually see the animals, it is not pitch black!

We ate at the Jungle Rotisserie and was good. However I was hoping for more safari/ African themed restaurants.

The tram was such a delightful ride. It was a good 45 mins that brought you to areas you wouldn’t see by foot - which means there is only about 3 more hours to cover all the shows and every other enclosure.

We read lots of mixed reviews but had heard good things in person and had the time so decided to go. We both love animals so it was something that appealed anyway.
We booked on the 7pm and arrived around 7.50pm due to work, but this ended up working very well. With 7pm tickets we were able to go straight in. A member of staff advised us to go straight to 'The creatures of the night' show and so we joined the queue. The show started at 8.30 so we queued for 15mins or so before being allowed in. They do prioritise group bookings so you may find that the arena is already quite full when you're let in. As there were only the two of us, we still had a few options to sit together and we ended up being right at the front on the left. Wherever you sit, you will get a good view but being closer does mean that you see some of the animals up close. Others come down the aisles. There were a couple of queue cutters before we got into the arena but on the whole people were polite and orderly which makes the queuing less stressful.
The show itself was great - lots of different animals and delivered confidently by the staff.

After the show make sure to walk around the park. There was a queue for the tram and we had been advised to use it later. As you are standing with your back to the entrance, take a left and walk the park that way. It is much quieter as most people with families try to do the tram early. The signs are very easy to follow and we saw a great deal and even had time alone by some of the enclosures. We went on a Tuesday evening during school holidays!

We probably took about 2 hours to walk around although you could do it faster if you're not too worried about watching the animals for long. There were a couple of areas where you even get to walk through the cages like with the bats.
We got back to the entrance around 10.50/11 and then walked straight onto a waiting tram. We were the only people in our whole carriage and 2 of about 10 on the entire tram. This meant that we heard the commentary fully and had no distractions. The tram journey was longer than I expected and stopped by some of the enclosures so you had time to look for the animals. We were fortunate that we saw lots.

It's unfortunate that some of the animals can only be seen on the car ride portion, like the elephants or the rhino. The enclosures that you can walk through are quite fun a unique, like the parma wallaby and the birds/bats enclosures. While I think the Night Safari is a unique place to visit, I do think it's overpriced for what you get. They offer a live show and a lion feeding that I didn't get to see, but I would suggest making it to those as well if you want to feel like you got your money's worth.",03-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:18:52.536630

The place is huge with the usual gift shops and food outlets, fairly quiet when we arrived and no queues for anything - you actually get your entrance ticket at the zoo (across the road from the night safari) cost £55 for 2. A shuttle runs every 10 mins and we didn't have to queue at all. The route takes you past numerous open areas where the animals are relaxing - they are not at all bothered by the tram and we saw lions, elephants, bears, flamingos + many more, some (not dangerous) animals are roaming free so came very close to the tram carriages - it really was a great experience.

Poor visibility and very less number of animals to display. They showed buffaloes and deer which are commonly seen on some streets in India :/ .

If you're looking for the likes of Central Park's zoo, this isn't for you!

We came here during the March school holidays which was a little poorly timed. However, if you arrive early and have a walk before the show, you can still get a lot in and have time to spare for the tram ride and more exploring afterwards. After 9pm, it starts getting quieter as the families with children leave.

It's a dimly lit place as well so just be careful, but I really appreciated this because it created a conducive environment for the animals. The tram ride was very enjoyable as well as it passed through free-range areas for some animals, that are allowed to roam in a spacious area.

We stayed until closing time and loved the experience, especially the reserve's focus on conservation.

Then because we were on an arranged tour we got to jump the queue for the train that takes you around the park. And so you leap on this train/tram and head out on the night safari. There's no guarantee that you will actually see any animals because to all intent and purpose they are wild animals and the humans are the captives - and of course the aim is to see their nocturnal habits. Well we did see a whole range of animals who seemed oblivious to the train in the dark - it was great fun - but my photos were pretty rubbish sadly!

I was a bit put off by some of the negative reviews but actually it turned out to be a very enjoyable visit.

We travelled to the Night Safari by one of the coaches’ that come to the hotels. Ours was with SAE and it cost us $10 return to be picked up at the hotel around 6pm to get to the Night Safari for about 7pm and we took the last coach back at 11.15pm.

When we got there people were queuing but this is because they were watching the fire show at the entrance and not walking into the zoo. We walked straight in as we picked the furthest lane from the fire show so no queuing for us. We asked the man that checked our ticket for a map as we had decided to walk round first. There were some people queuing for the tram ride as I think coach parties come here and must be pushed for time so they go on the tram first. As we went at 7.15 it was just turning dusk and there were lots of bats flying round and squirrels which can be a bit scary. We did see lots of animals as we walked round. Obviously in a zoo there is no guarantee to see an animal you just have to be in the right spot at the right time. We timed it right to see the leopard and one of the tigers as they appeared just as we walked up to their enclosures. We hardly saw anyone else as we were walking round which was a bit surreal. The walking routes cover some of the same area of as the tram but the tram also has its own section as well.

When we had finished walking round we got the tram which didn’t have any queue at this point and was more than half empty. Your ticket time is for the entrance to the park, not when you have to get a tram. The only animals we didn’t see were the wolves. We saw the hippos as we were walking round but they had gone by the time we went past on the tram. After the tram ride we popped outside to one of the eating places. You can have your hand stamped so you can get back in to the park. We then went back in to watch the last animal show. I enjoyed the show. It was suitable for both kids and adults. We didn’t queue for the show but did have to sit in the side wings rather the centre.

We had wanted to see some flying squirrels in their walkthrough enclosure so walked back to that but didn’t see any, however when we were on the tram I had seen a wild one fly through the air and land on a tree so at least I did get to see one.",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:19:17.602507

The park opens at 7pm and we made the mistake of booking a ticket for 9:15pm thinking that we were getting on a special tram ride at that time. NO... it is actually just your admission time to the park. You still need to line up for the tram ride. Line up to see the special informative animal shows they put on and walk around the park yourself. As there are exhibits that you won’t be able to see from the tram.
Lots of animals to see and most of them you’ll probably see on your own rather than from the tram. The show was good as they brought out some animals that you wouldn’t usually get to see on your own.
Lots of eating venues and shops there too which we didn’t know about.

We travelled to the night safari via a $1 Mandai Khatib shuttle bus from Khatib MRT station. It was very convenient except for the fact that it stops running at around 10:45pm yet the night safari park is open until 12 midnight.

Bought ticket online and was asked what time is my visit and I choose 7.15pm. Enter the night safari there was a long queue for the tram ride we waited almost 30 minutes before getting into the tram ride. To be honest we cannot see much animals along the route but we thought we can just go and see more by foot. The tram ride took about 30 minutes and we were back around 8.15pm and found out there was an animal show at 9pm but we need to start queuing at 8.30pm. Why do we need to keep wasting time queuing when in the first place we have a timing for our ticket? And we thought we could just go to the trail by foot to see more animals. It took us about an hour to complete the trail and I must say it is a complete waste of time and we found most animal enclosure are empty or poorly lit, there was basically nothing for us to see except that there are many deer type animals and some cat family animals.

We were excited and went. Now note that we were born in East Africa, where the Serengeti and the Masai Mara are at our doorstep, so our rating is a little bit unfair considering. Although with that in mind we were open minded when going. The whole setup/organization/service, etc was amazing. But that was also a bit of the downside in itself. Felt too perfect and choreographed. Nothing Wild about it, all in Captivity. It was as if the animals were stuffed and moving from far with motors or at minimum, sedated. How does a female Lion not eat the other animals less than 50 metres away from it? That's not nature! Let's be honest. Unless there are invisible electric fences around, some of it all didn't make sense. But nevertheless a good outing and especially fun for the unsuspecting kids who won't tie logic to the goings on of this ride...otherwise be ready to answer some hard questions!! :)",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:19:27.278074

To book I emailed the zoo months in advance of our trip and they were quick with their responses. I paid in advance, we opted not to include dinner but you do have to purchase an entry ticket as well. On arrival the lady on the customer service desk knew it was us before even saying. I thought this odd but it turned out that there were only 4 people on the tour that night. The tour can accommodate a maximum of seven people, we were all adults which was good. We were met by Nua our superb and knowledgeable guide. We were escorted to the show for the first one of the night and seated in reserved seating area with a super view. Afterwards we were taken to a golf buggy and away we went. The advantage of this option is that you can ‘loiter’ round the enclosures and get a good view of the animals whilst listening to really informative details about the animals, the zoo etc. Joining the throngs on the tram does not allow this and they pass the private tour regularly. It included a walk in the leopard area, this was the only animal we didn’t manage to see! We were treated to seeing some of the smaller cats being fed. The tour included feeding the elephants and this in itself was fantastic. I felt very privileged to do so and meet these creatures. You were able to touch one of them the others were just over the fence. Our tour started about 7pm and we left at 11pm so it was well worth it. This is not a place to take photos because you can’t use a flash but actually you can enjoy the animals without the pressure to photograph them. The zoo is about an hour from the centre, we took a taxi each way at reasonable cost for the duration at about $30spd from garden Bay Area. Buses do run to the zoo but take in excess of an hour. There are plenty of taxis for the return.

Not Recommended","Boy, I had really high hopes when we came to the Singapore Night Safari. It looks cool and I liked the idea but the reality that many of the animals do not co-operate and come out at night to be seen or seen easily. Those that do seem to be on the other side of the tram. The lighting is poor and it is difficult to see at times. I love to take photos wherever I travel but this venue was a bust for photo taking. Between the low night lighting and the constant moving of the tram it is nearly impossible to get any clear photos.

BOTTOM LINE: So disappointed in this excursion. With 4 people on a seat bench on the tram, it is hard to see both sides. The night show is ok. Overall I did not think it was worth the time and money to see this hyped up ""night safari"". I was bored. Save your money and pass! MY RATING: 4/10.",03-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:19:28.251424

It is also a long way out of the centre - allow an hour if you are going by public transport from the CBD.

We were told to run as the last ""show"" was 21.30. If you don't like seeing animals perform for human pleasure then don't go to this.

In the Creatures of the Night Show theater, need to sit close to the middle as possible to be able to get a good view of the animals. For the tram ride through the zoo, the waiting time in line was longer than the actual ride through the zoo. The beginning of the tram boarding line is not clearly marked and was changing while we watched in line. We observed that the boarding process could also be more efficient. The tram moves relatively quickly through the zoo which made the sighting animals hard. Suggest walking through the zoo instead of the tram to allow better viewing of the animals.

Anyhow it had been recommended by a few friends and so without reading up about we bought a ""tour"" through the hotel conceige including collection and return to our hotel.
The ""collector"" arrived 30 minutes than we were expecting, a total of two coach changes and we were on our way.
Our tickets were ""priority"" boarding so no lines to board the tram which promised a 40 minute tour. Now admitantly I did not time the tour but but on the basis of when we left and the time left to kill afterwards I would guess at around 30 minutes was nearer the truth.
It could have well been short due to the fact that we saw very few animals and those that we did see were so far away, the tram stops for very short periods to view and then moves on whether we are ready or not.
The only real viewing was of the tiger which of course is behind glass and acting very stressed pacing across the enclosure as they do when stressed. Did not enjoy.
There are walks to be taken through some of the enclosures and again due to my wifes walking issues we were unable to avail ourselves of these so cannot comment.
The only other thing to pass the time until your return coach arrives is either eat or queue for a 800 seat theater with no guarantee of a seat when you get to the end!
As far we could establish they make no concessions for disabled people to attend the show.
They do not allow coaches to park on the drop off zone and for unkown reasons we managed to miss our planned return coach, thankfully their is a 6SS$ option to get back which departs on the hour to town hotel drop offs.

Get there early if you prebook (though you don’t have to) and whilst queuing there is a fire performance to pass the time which is excellent. We booked the 9.15pm entry and we finished the whole experience at 11.30pm.
Once through the entrance gates turn right and head to watch the show (most people go for the tram ride at this point). There will probably be another queue but the amphitheatre is huge. The Creatures of the Night Show is great fun!
After the show do not follow the hordes again for the tram ride but go one of the trails (the Wallaby Trail is nearest) and walk around the trails. This has the added advantage of giving you your bearings on the tram ride and, more importantly, avoiding the screaming children mentioned in other posts because just 40 minutes later there will probably be no queue at all! Also we had a peaceful tram ride and saw lots of animals and it was very special.
We also used public transport to get there (Citymapper app is excellent for routings) because we’d bought a 3 day tourist pass for $20 and wanted to make best use of it. The journey took less than an hour from Clarke Quay.
On the way back there was a long queue for taxis (apparently about $30+ per trip downtown) so we paid just $6 each for the two of us for a minibus ride at midnight to Orchard Road (Hyatt Hotel), then there are plenty of night buses to get wherever you want to go.",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:19:54.203374

The tram is cool, but it's dark and you have to accept you're not going to see everything, but most animals are visible and there is low level lighting. We were part of a tour so we got straight on the tram, but the queues were long for most.

We also caught the fire show, which I thought was great, and the night time critters show too. More aimed at kids, but the host (Friday 25th Jan) did a great job under the circumstances, which I'll get to.

The place is far busier than I thought it would be, but given the aim of what they're doing that's a good thing, and it's pretty easy to get to and good value.

Here's my issue; stupid, horrible, ignorant tourists. How many times to people need to be told not to use flash photography? Apparently it doesn't matter how many times. It ruins it for others who are being respectful and considerate of the animals, and can have harmful consequences.

The fire show was brilliant and had a decent sized crowd. But despite the efforts of the performers, the audience just doesn't seem to care. May be a tough audience for that particular show, but I would have thought on a Friday evening people who be a bit more up for it! A real shame I thought as they were great but I ended up feeling a bit bad for them.

Same thing with the critters show. It's a great idea, great bunch of colleagues and great animals. But it's the humans that ruin it. No flash photography, please stay seated and stay until the end as animals appear from everywhere - very simple rules that people just can't follow. Particularly ignorant when people are getting up and walking out when it's only a 25 minute show anyway.

TLDR: great concept, great staff, great animals, great shows. Ignorant tourists who will gladly do their best to ruin it.",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 15:20:03.876595

The Zoo was great, the River Safari was okay, but the Night Safari was awesome!! Yes--It's crowded and as Americans, we are used to our personal space, which you will not get there. For the Night Safari, you have to select a time for your ticket entry and they will not let you in until you designated time. First ticket time is 7 p.m., but we had 8 p.m. They lined us up about 30 minutes before our designated time. You wait to go through the first part to then be held in a second line where you also wait. Then at your designated time, they open the second gate and you can either walk the path, get in the line for the tram (which for us still had people in line from the 7 p.m. entrants), or you can go to the Night Show. There were two shows. We decided to do the show first at 8:30 p.m., which meant we waiting in another line. It is first come, first serve so you need to decide which thing you are going to do so you can go straight there. The Night Show was about 25 minutes and pretty cute. The guy was great. The animals were interesting and were not forced to do anything. They have been trained to do tricks. One of the animals chose not to do his trick, which was cute in itself. After the show, we go in the line for the tram, which at this point moved pretty quickly. We took the 45 minute tour around the park listening to the automated recording as you passed by each animals enclosure. Lots of animals were out at night. It was great. Then my husband and I decided to walk the trail. At first we were only going to do a little bit of it, but after we started walking, we ending up walking the entire place. I liked riding the tram, then walking it. You saw a lot of the same things, but since the tram is on a road and the walking is on a path, you don't see everything on both. The only unfortunate part was since it was dark, our pictures did not come out well. That was kind of okay as it forced us to just enjoy the animals. My only complaint was with the tiger. He paced A LOT. I don't know if it was because people we taking pictures (with flash--which they told everyone not to do A LOT), if his enclosure didn't allow for enough space or whether that was his normal behavior. He paced and walked in the same circular path. None of the other animals did that. The rest seemed very relaxed and enjoying life. Overall though, it was absolutely a favorite of mine. That and an elephant sanctuary in Thailand. Highly recommend this, but either get your ticket for the earliest time or later when there are less people.",12-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:20:20.032882

It is very important to listen to information during the ride in terms of following which helped to spot the animals in the night. Some of them were very close to trail while others are difficult to see (wild animals) which is normal.

It was an opportunity to see few animals I did not see before.

On the other side, location is quite far hence booking a round trip transportation was really convenient and comfortable for us to be picked up from nearest location of our hotel and drop back.

When booking you have to choose a slot, the 7:15 was very busy so we chose the 8:15. There was a very cheap and convenient bus that picked us up directly from our hotel which cost roughly £5 for a return ticket. On arrival we were greeted with the usual long queue, souvenir shops, and food and drink stands. It didn’t take too long to get in, maybe 15 minutes. Once in you then have a choice to take the tram tour first, or head out on foot. I recommend you do both as there are some things you won’t see if you only take one or the other. We decided to walk first, where it becomes a lot less busy. Attractions include giant bats, flying foxes, insects, hyenas, and much more. Don’t be surprised if you don’t see all the animals, as it’s dark, it’s incredibly hard to see some of them if they are hiding. The tram ride is very entertaining depending on the tour guide you get. I recommend you sit at the front, our driver seemed to do his own commentary for those on the front, and he was very entertaining. On the tram ride you see elephants, many types of Deer, rhino, and much more.It was a lovely trip out, however as with any trip in Asia, be prepared to be surrounded by loud Chinese people snorting and spitting everywhere. Ive lived in Hong Kong before, but I still never got used to it. Also it’s a shame tourists thought it necessary to bring very young kids and babies to this attraction. We had screaming kids that the parents couldn’t control which was frustrating - I recommend you go as late as possible to avoid this.All in all - it’s lovely to see the animals at night, and it’s also great that the Night Safari invest of lot of their profits into animal conservation. They make it very clear on the tour the destruction humans have caused to natural habitats, and mention the evils of poaching (but stop short of actually blaming the Chinese and Africans for the their use of “traditional medicines” and Ivory which feeds this disgusting business).Definitely go and see this if you have time.

Four shows nightly allow for lots of people to participate in this event. Admission is controlled for each show. A short wait is required before being allowed into the outdoor auditorium. Our hostess had a great personality and kept the event moving nicely. We were introduced to several Asian animals that had been trained to do some things—like the owls doing a flyover or the blond raccoon appearing on stage. After the show, we left for the tram ride which showed other animals in a more or less natural habitat. Many of these animals are endangered, and this zoo has worked to help preserve them with breeding programs. Only the tiger was sequestered, but he was active as we went by.

RMG Tours picked us up right on time from our hotel and the tour commenced, as always, at Gardens by the Bay. We had buckets of time to spend at the night zoo (which is completely separate to the Singapore Zoo). The zoo is actually a wildlife reserve with the animals free to roam in expansive enclosures.

First we did the tram ride (included in tour cost). My first impression was that there were so many active animals to see. Not just the odd one or two but whole groups (hard to pick the correct collective noun to use here!!) of animals. Easy to see and quite close and the variety of fauna was quite diverse. After the tram ride there is a maze of walks to take which covers a lot of territory. The reserve is quite big and the maze of walks are split into four sections which are all connected: Fishing Cat Trail, Leopard Trail, East Lodge Trail and Wallaby Trail. Easy walking and we went at a leisurely pace and still finished all trails with half an hour to spare. Thoroughly recommend that you do the full four walks. We started with the Fishing Cat Trail.

The Night Safari is NOT to be missed and I congratulate RMG Tours for making it an easy and leisurely experience. The Tour guide explained in detail all we needed to know on the tour bus on the way to the safari and then we were left completely to our own devices to make 'choices' about what we wanted to do and how we wanted to plan our time. Our choice was to do the full walks and therefore skip the fire show and creatures of the night show.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Mr_RN,635905582,27-11-2018,5,What a great and unique experience,"Singapore Night Safari, the first in the world, immerses you into the nocturnal world while it is actually nighttime. First thing to know is to buy your tickets at Singapore Zoo (or, if you buy them from an app, pick them up at Singapore Zoo).

Once you've entered, you essentially have 3 choices - walk the zoo, take the tram, or get in line for the Creatures of the Night show. I would recommend doing the show to ensure you get a seat. The night show was not only good entertainment but it really focused on education of animals and the environment. It is well worth the time to attend.

The tram takes you through most of the zoo, slowing down at spots where the animals are likely to be. No pictures with flash as it startles the animals. The tram is set to a recorded track (which can be skipped, advanced, or rewinded by the driver). Not all animals will be in view (they are animals, after all) but we were able to see almost all of them. The tram ride takes about 40 minutes in total.

You can also walk the zoo. There are 4 ""sections"" but it is basically a big circle. Once you get half way through, you might as well finish. You see many of the same animals but you can stop to appreciate them (or search for them if you didn't see them before). There are also a lot of education displays about each animal. I would definitely recommend walking. The four trails are Fishing Cat Trail (you can see a fishing cat), Leopard Trail (leopards, lions, golden cats, as well as flying foxes), East Lodge Trail Malayan tigers, babirusas, bongos, and hyenas), and Wallaby Trail (Wallabies).

There are some feeding sessions (we didnt see them) for lions (8 and 9pm on Lion Lookout along Leopard Trail) and tigers at 8:30pm and 9:30pm at the Malayan Tiger exhibit (along East Lodge Trail).

A few other notes:

It will likely be busy (the trails weren't too busy but the line for the tram can be a bit of a wait)

There is food but most of it is immediately outside the park

Everything is expensive - it is a zoo, I think it is kind of expected",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:21:13.642129

I was completely sold on the idea and really excited that we were 'booked' in for the 1915 start. Only, you're not booked on it at all, you still have to get there early (really early, like half 6 latest) to ensure you enter. I had read it was first come first serve but when the cashier said we were booked on at 1915 I thought we were sorted for that time. Thankfully we had just finished eating about half 6 and thought we best join the queue. (Being British can help sometimes, we do love a queue.)
Queued from half 6 until 7 when the scrum moved forward and we were allowed in. We went straight to the 'Creatures of the Night' Show, where we had to wait again another 10 minutes before we could go in to the amphitheatre. (Outdoors and shows are weather permitting). The show itself is brilliant and Yamini is very funny and extremely engaging. It was well worth the wait.
To the team next for a night ride through the safari with commentary. Don't expect to take photos of this as there's not enough light. It was pretty amazing to see some of the animals up and about behaving close to there normal routine. It wasn't as great as we hoped but that's because we had spent 8 hours of the day in the zoo so we were very tired. Had we have had more energy, we would've enjoyed it even more and explored the walking trails. The fire show near the food area is pretty impressive. I'd stay and watch that. Having said that, it was significantly more than the zoo tickets and I don't think it's worth all the extra.",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:21:14.343354

As for the park itself being our second visit I guess it had lost the wow factor for us. We had to que up for approx 20 minutes even though we had priority boarding and I was told later it was a quiet night. Once we boarded the tram I was unlucky enough to be directed to the front row of our tram where directly in front of you is a screen/window which obstructed my view and made it difficult to video the animals which I had been looking forward to this trip so avoid sitting up front if you can. Seeing the animals in that environment is lovely although I thought the tiger at the end of the trip around looked quite agitated. Not a lot more to do after the tram trip and don t think I would bother again finding the crowds a bit much at my age.

We’d bought tickets in advance, for 8.15 entry. Food options are very limited, and quite expensive for the ‘hawker’ dishes available. The waiting staff noticed that we’re finished our dinner by 7.30, and they offered to organise early entry for us. This meant that we missed the worst of the crowds. The queue for the tram was still very long, but there are resting places all along the queue line, so we were able to cope with the wait. We are both seniors (63 and 74 years old) but nobody told us until the end of the queue that there is a priority line for older guests, or those with special needs. On boarding the tram, we remembered the advice to sit in the second carriage, in the right hand side. This was very useful advice, as we were able to see nearly all the animals. The commentary was in a English, and it was very informative. The tram driver stopped longer at some points, to enable everyone to get a good look at certain animals.One suggestion for improvement: the brochure could have more specific information about the tram route, and which animals might be seen in each location.We were too hot and tired to do any of the walking trails, but apparently you can see different animals that way.Signage regarding return to the city could be clearer. The $1 shuttle bus to the nearest MRT station is great value, and very convenient, but there is no warning that you must pay by MRT card. They won’t accept cash, and 2 people were turned away, without clear ideas of how to get back home.Overall - a unique experience that is very well-organised and moves crowds of people through very efficiently.

The wait to go onto the tram car tour which is the highlight of the night can take up to and over an hour some times so paying the extra $10 to go in the express lane to get on is a great idea as you may not have time to do all the walking trails otherwise.

Low and behold 45 mins after booking we experienced the biggest thunderstorm we had in Singapore! Come 6pm it was still raining and we thought shall we bother even going all that way. My app was telling me it wasn't raining in the area of the zoo though so we thought lets just chance it. The app was right and it wasn't raining and we had a great evening. All the animals were visible on the tram ride and the walking trail. We saw the tiger feeding as well which was nice. The last show which we were planning to watch was cancelled as the thunderstorm reached the zoo around 10.30pm but bar that we had a great time.

It’s important to note that the zoo had no responsibility to do this for us at all. The team ride was great - the animals look healthy and you could see them easily unless they didn’t want to be seen with made me feel good about the size of their enclosures. The Night Show was awesome - definitely go to this!!! Afterwards we walked the trails to see more of the enclosures on our own time and this was well worth it.

We had selected the tram ride option for viewing the entire park which turned out to be a good decision. The park is awesome. You can see the animals with close proximity. Great experience.

The night safari takes place when it gets dark. You can take the road train around the park which takes around 40 mins. You can also walk around the park on various trails. There is also a 'animals of the night show'

First of all let me talk about the crowds. These are large when the park opens. Everyone heads to the road train or the show. A little tip. Don't do either initially. Go on one of the self guided trails and let the mad rush die down.

Another thing on queuing. Please just take your turn. Don't just try and push your way through as several older males did as we were queuing. The queues are well organised.. be patient.

The animals in the night show was not very impressive. In fact training what are wild animals to perform goes against the grain for me. The show maybe lasts for 15-20 mins and they bring on various nocturnal animals. As usual there is a conservation message.

The safari is on a road train consisting of about 4 carriages. The queue to board the carriages is well organised. As you are driven around you are told no flash photography but do people listen?? No!!
There is a running commentary on the vehicle as you are transported around but I found at times it was inaudible and at other times the commentary was either ahead of or behind the point we were at! Frustrating.
There are a number of animals you see along the way. Why they stay next to the road and don't wander off I presume is down to the food they have close to the road.
We didn't do any of the walking trails but there are more animals to see along these trails.
There are a number of eateries and gift shops as you would expect mostly based around the central courtyard. Overall an interesting visit but take my advice and let the crowds die down first.",10-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:21:51.203457

After this you have the option of dining at the place, they have some restaurants there. Alternatively, you can walk around the park as well to see the animals at your own pace (we did this after the show, then the caravan, then the trails) - you also see some animals that the caravan route does not show.Hope this helps!",10-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:21:51.549295

We booked the tram for the first slot and went straight to the queue. We had seen bad reviews due to queuing times but this didn't happen while we were there. Saw lots of nocturnal animal which was lovely. After the ride round we went to see the animal show which was cute. We didn't walk round or watch the fire show simply because we were tired from a busy day but this would also have been good. We did get pushed and shoved a bit coming out but this is due to rude tourists not the zoo. We recommend this for all age groups.,09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:22:25.477015

We were picked up bang on time at 18:15 but what they then do is take you to the Gardens in the Bay terminus to consolidate the various trip options on to a second set of coaches, which took 30 minutes. It then takes a further 30-40 minutes depending on traffic to get to the Night Safari Zoo. The guide gets to pass the tram queues and onto the next available tram which takes you around the zoo after which you get about an hour free time to walk around and/or have a meal or drink. By 9pm the number of visitors is thinning out and as the zoo is open until 12 midnight if I visited again I think I would arrive at 9pm. Tram ride was quite good as the animals mostly seemed to be within view – but we most enjoyed the walk about when we were lucky to see a keeper doing a talk about the wallabies, actually see the elusive fishing cat. You can get to the Zoo on the Hippo Tourist Bus, Public Transport or a taxi. We paid a total of about £40 each (so you are only paying about an extra £15 for coach pick-up, transfers to zoo, guide and queue jumping so well worth the extra).",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:22:25.822057

During the whole tour I was disturbed by the engine sound and the smell of gasoline.
They talked about protecting the nature and the animals, so I see why not switching the tour vehicle to something more ecological. It would be more quiet, which is less stress for the animals as well. The guide could be also done by headphones to keep the silence for them, for those who would like to hear the guide can plug the headphones in.
Maybe they already have been talking about the idea...but because as much as I love the place, thought its a pity the experience with the trams.

1: The night Safari
2: The zoo restaurant
3: Viator and Tour East - Singapore who offer the specific tour

1. The Night Safari
This was excellent and definitely worth doing. I would recommend to forget dinner and more fully explore the zoo. Really this is not a sight to miss. So 9/10 for this part only

2. The Zoo Restaurant
This was okay. A little over priced but the food was good and the range was excellent. Unless you have plenty of time I would skip eating here and more fully explore the Restaurant. So 6/10 alone.

3. Viator and Tour East - Singapore who offer the specific tour
Really this part was a shocker!! We were picked up early from our motel, only to be dropped in china town to wait then change buses to wait again before heading towards the zoo. Well we lost an hour in this fiasco. Then when we arrived we were shuffled to the Restaurant for another hour. Then shuffled to a holding yard to wait again and then another holding pen to wait again before boarding the tram.
The tram ride was awesome (see above) but then we had lost too much time we couldn’t see the live animal show but we were taken for a ‘trail walk’. Some eight minutes into the trail walk, our guide decided that we didn’t have time to complete it so turned around and went back to the entrance saying “just look at the shops for 20 minuets”. So given the very poor logistics we got to see less than a third of the zoo and only one show of two. This wouldn’t be as bad if the advertising didn’t say “Use your skip-the-line pass to the Night Safari tram for priority boarding, and spend your 4 hours exploring the nighttime rainforest rather than waiting in line”. Sorry we got less than two hours to ‘explore the zoo’ and although the zoo was great the tour was embarrassingly poorly organised. I would rate them 1/10 (at least we didn’t get lost).

If you’re going to the night Safari find another way and eat before you go . . .",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:22:35.686685

I preferred the zoo at night as the main animals come to life at night, so there’s a bit more action going on.

Now to the nitty gritty part of the experience. Firstly you have to book a time you want to attend but I really think that doesn’t matter as it’s a mad house when you actually turn up on the night. There are massive lines to get on the trams, so you could be waiting a long time... The best thing I recommend to do is walk to the feeding as by the time you get on the tram you’ll probably miss it. So get there nice and early and go to the feedings and there’s also other shows on that we missed as they were all booked out by the time you got on the tram and back again.
So my best advice is find out the feeding times, go to those, go to the shows and then jump on the tram. All in all still a good experience.",07-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:22:36.373262

If you bought Hop On Hop Off ticket, the bus ride to and from the Zoo are included in your ticket price and you really should take this as the Zoo is VERY VERY VERY (at least an hour) far from downtown. If you take the Hop On Hop Off you will be limited on time, so first take the walking tour so the Tram line will decrease.

Singapore Zoo have the set up and infrastructure to make this really special but there is just something a bit lacking.

When you arrive everyone is lining up for the tram ride, so you follow suit. The tram ride lasts about 40 minutes and goes around most enclosures.

If you go on the tram, not things are on the right hand side. The only big animals on the left is the tiger and the elephants. Lions, Hyenas, Rhinos and Bears are all on the right hand side.

The tram ride is very hit and miss and that is what let’s the Night Safari down. There is no reason why the tram has to be continually moving. It would be far more interesting if the tram stopped when at some of the bigger animals such as Lions, Tiger & Hyena.
It would be improved again if there was some interaction such as the animals being fed when you drive past, otherwise most of the animals are just lying there, sometimes not even visible.

We got lucky that the tiger was at the front of the enclosure as we drove past for 5 seconds, if it has been at the back we wouldn’t have seen it at all.

All in all the tram ride felt rushed and it could be so much better.

Make sure you don’t get off the tram and walk with the crowds right through the exit. The Night Safari isn’t just the tram ride, there are several walking trails giving you the chance to spend more time at the enclosures and even see some animals that are not part of the tram route.

Again the walking trails could be improved if the animals were interacted with by keepers, otherwise like us you won’t see the leopards and you’ll be luck to see the tiger.",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:23:02.216420

Today, the award-winning park welcomes more than 1.1 million visitors a year. They come from all over the world to enjoy the unique experience of seeing over a thousand animals in their naturalistic night-time habitats.
12-time winner of ‘Best attraction’ category awarded by Singapore Tourism Board, the star of the Night Safari experience is a guided tram-ride that takes you across six geographical zones of the world. From the rugged Himalayan foothills to the swampy banks of the Asian Riverine Forest and more, our tram-guide shared fascinating facts and tales about the animals and habitats along our journey.
We can explore the walking trails to see even more animals not visible from the tram journey. We may also stroll into the realm of the animals at the two giant aviaries, where the Malayan flying- foxes and giant flying-squirrels can come right next to you. The aviaries are along the Leopard Trail, where we can get within a whisker of the beautiful leopards from their dedicated glass observatory. Heading along the Fishing-Cat Trail and we can look in on fishing-cats, as they engage in their nightly river-side hunt. Then, we can trek right into the Outback to discover native wildlife of Australia, including a family of wallabies in their walk-through habitat along the all-new Wallaby Trail.

No visit is complete without enjoying the famous performances filled with humour, thrill and surprises. We caught the talented troupe of tribal warriors, as they thrilled us with their fiery stunts in the ‘Thumbuakar Performance’. We didn’t miss the must-see ‘Creatures of the Night’ show. This highly entertaining and interactive 20-minutes’ show highlighted the natural abilities of some of the most fascinating animals.
As we whetted our appetite for adventure, we made sure to indulge in Night Safari’s unique dining offerings - from gourmet fast-food to popular local delicacies served in the traditional village ambience of the Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant.

We understood that more than just being Singapore’s No.1 nightspot, the Night Safari Park has also been achieving success in their effort to support the conservation of bio-diversity. We read that over the years, they have bred Malayan tigers, Asiatic elephants, fishing-cats, Malayan tapirs and Asiatic lions, among other endangered species.

The person who said all queues lead to same place - thank you as we took the shortest queue and were on the third tram. Once on the tram (or long golf cart to be exact), you get a lot of commentary but it doesn't say very much. The animals are half asleep - which is not a surprise when the commentary says they sleep for up to 20 hours a day.

We do understand why it must be like this, but didn't factor that in when purchasing tickets for it.

Be aware that the zoo closes at 6pm, so if you elect for a 9:15pm Night Safari ticket you will need to figure out what to do with your time while you wait.

We got to the night safari entrance at 8.30pm and discovered a massive que. Before joining it we checked with a member of staff who told us we had to go to the main ticket office to exchange our eticket to a physical one.

Queued for 15 mins, then we got the pleasure of joining the massive que to the entrance. We got into the park at 9.20, to find another massive que in front of us for the tram.

We looked to see if we could get into the 9.30pm show.. It was full.

Joined the tram que, at 10pm we could hear and smell the fire show which for some reason is outside the entrance to the park and not to entertain the poor people who had now been in a que for now over 45mins.

We eventually got on a tram at 10.20pm, so no chance of seeing the last show at 10.30pm

The safari is fairly lame, you don't get long enough to look at the animals, and there is a little to much info being played through the sound system to enjoy the sound of the animals.

After the tram ride we went on a trail walk. Now this is great! Lots of information, nice paths, good viewing of the animals. Unfortunately this was also ruined for us as at 11.40 we had staff chasing us out of the park, and many animals had been put away or the area was closed. We thought we would be able to buy a drink at the cafe at the halfway point on the trail...also closed.

This place could be wonderful, but unfortunately we queued nearly for 1.5 hours for a rushed hour looking at the animals. The Zoo allows to many people into the park and they simply don't have enough trams or sitting capacity for the amount of people who attended.

If you do go, I would highly recommend buying the fast pass tram ticket and getting to the zoo at 7pm to enjoy it.",07-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:23:56.257501

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/vasavapr,595967409,14-07-2018,3,Experience can go either way,"Firstly the queues: The queues and waiting times for the tram (as many others have also pointed out) can be very long. There is absolutely no way to skip the lines. We had booked the 8:15 PM entry but we were still waiting in the queue at 9 PM. After spending whole day at the zoo, it certainly wasnt a pleasant experience waiting in the queue for a tram ride. The thumbuakar performance provided some entertainment and respite while waiting in the queue.

Next the tram: Unlike the main zoo, trams can only be taken at the starting point. During our visit we were not allowed to take the tram from middle. The tram goes by only selected animals, so one has to be on foot to see rest of the animals.

Now the review: After being tired of just standing in the queue for more than an hour we decided to see everything on feet (possibly the best decision we made). We could see almost all the animals at our own pace. For example while on feet we saw the whole lion pride but when on tram we only saw one lion.

After about 2 hours when we returned to the starting point, there was no queue for the tram so we decided to jump in and take the tour again by tram.

Flash photography will scare the animals so unless you have a good night vision camera that takes good photos in dark, forget about taking picture and enjoy the ride.

Lastly, finding wash rooms and drinking water was very difficult.",06-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:23:56.913422

Once on the road train (one every 10mins or so) then it reverts to what you are probably expecting. You do see plenty of animals and the non-dangerous ones you can almost touch from the road train. You cannot use a flash on camera, so taking decent photographs is going to need a very good camera. Once in the place you can go on multiple events, so it can end up reasonable value.

The tram rides run in 4 slots separated by an hour starting at 7 PM. I opted for the 8 PM slot after reading over-crowding at the tram stations and must say I was glad I did. The crowd was certainly less despite it being weekend.

The tram ride itself was great with the guide telling us interesting stories about animals there. The fact that some animals would come close to the tram during the ride was thrilling. They also have walking trails in case you're not satisfied with the 15 minute ride and want to watch some animals more closely. The signboards at some places aren't sufficient but the staff on-site are very courteous and helpful making the trek comfortable and hassle free.

One more thing that truly deserves a mention is the Creatures of the Night show at the Night Safari. It is a free show for all Night Safari guests and it's brilliant.

The tram ride was quite comfortable & a good way to be close to the animals at night. We were lucky to spot all the animals which were pointed out by the tram guide.
To add to the fun we even did the walking trails which were 3 in total ; one leading to another. This brought us even closer to some of the animals. The walk was really thrilling as some of the stretches passed through secluded part ( yet safe)of the forest. And to add to the adventure, we could hear the king of the jungle, the lion roar while we were walking!
The live animal show was good too. Many nocturnal animals were staged in a narrated performance which was hosted by a guy who added lots of comic elements .

We booked from our hotel and were picked up and returned there so that was fine and that's the best part, Once we arrived our guide escorted us into the park and looked at the lines for the train and decided to take us on the loop walk till the lines diminished we guessed now we were supposed to be viewing night animals ok so off we go at a rate of knots as if she is in a sprint race, she stops at a display tells the group what it is then moves on without us having much time to one view or take some pictures!
Next we are on the train with just the driver and a pre-recorded monologue well this becomes just as interesting why you ask?
He pulls up to a display and only he and the first carriage can really see the animals so question 1:doe's he move forward for others to see or 2:speed off to the next display?
Answer is 2 yes we at the tail end get no chance for viewing or photo op !
This went on the whole time and to be honest the rhino where laying down very strange and the 5 elephants we saw were huddled in a spot as if scared and the poor bull elephant was in a separate pen, ok ok so some of you will say well these are live animals and you cannot predict what you will see yes true however most of us did not get to see much and what we did see was somewhat not real after viewing these animals in the real wild. Zoos do a great job in conservation and protection but this review was about this particular attraction and it was not worth the time or much less the money.
They need to train the driver to allow all passengers to view the displays by moving forward to allow them that option.",06-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:24:13.313504

Half hour session in the amphitheatre which was very entertaining but with an important environmental message.
The animals were very well trained
Then onto the main event which was mind blowing and the best part of the holiday
To be up close at night to so many species was incredible and we particularly enjoyed the giraffes, elephants and lions
With the lights out on the tram the animals were floodlit in their little sections and was very effective
There was also the option of a walk after the tram ride
The queues, although long was very efficiently handled by the staff, good food options and the fire eating dancers were brilliant
On leaving there were good options by bus and taxi and in fact the last bus back to the city was about 0015 which left plenty of time to enjoy this amazing experience

Both the male elephants were rocking back and forth, and appeared to be chained up to ensure they could be seen.

We booked a tour that included hotel pick up. We were taken to Chinatown and had to wait around a little while for other participants to arrive, which we weren't expecting, but it was clearly the meeting point for many of Singapore's tours. Our tour guide, Robin, was informative and helpful and obviously loved the environment and animals. The buffet dinner was OK, but we only had about 45 minutes to eat, so it was a little rushed.

Our tour included 'skip the line' tickets for the tram, which was a good thing as the queues were extremely long. Unfortunately for us it started to pour with rain when we got on the tram. The tram guide advised anyone who had a problem with the rain to pull down the plastic side shades, which were opaque, so when the woman in front of us pulled down the shade our view was ruined. The tram has a covered roof, so there is no need really to pull down the side shades. The whole point is to see the animals and even though the rain meant viewing was less than it should be, the shades made it impossible. My advice is stop telling patrons to pull down the shades, it's not necessary.

Luckily the rain eased after the tram ride and we were able to enjoy the walking trails with our guide, Robin, who imparted interesting information along the way.

Parts of the zoo are commercialised, but it's good the main focus is on the animals roaming free in a natural habitat. I look forward to returning on a rain free night next time I'm in Singapore.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:24:40.023717

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/KUExplorer,585288121,05-06-2018,5,Not to be missed,"The Night Safari is one of Singapore's top attractions. Located near the Singapore Zoo Resort area you can combine a ticket here with one or more attractions (Singapore Zoo and River Safari) to get a discount. Tickets for the Night Safari are entry timed. So you pick the time you want to enter the park but once you're in, you can stay for as long as you like. We chose the first entry time slot (7.15) and even though it was a weekday, there were already hundreds of people waiting to enter the park from about 6.45. If you want to be the first in, then consider getting your tickets early and queuing up from about 6.15! The majority of the crowds were heading straight towards the tram tour which takes you on a 25 minute silent tram ride (with english speaking voice over) around the park enclosures. The wait time to get on the tram was quite long, we waited almost 40 minutes through a cattle grid queue system before we boarded. It's the main attraction so dont miss out on this. But if you want to avoid the waiting in line, then either consider visiting the park later (its open until 12am) or entering the park and doing the walking tours first (which I'll describe later on). The tram tour takes you around different ""open"" enclosures where animals are free to roam and can sometimes be right on the roadside. It was great to see most of the animal in open enclosures and not behind metal bars or perspex, some of the bigger or more dangerous animals (like the hyenas) were cleverly held back by natural landscaping rather than being caged. After the tram tour, you can disembark and do one or all of 4 walking trails which take you further in for a more up close and intimate encounter with the animals. You see much more on the walking trails so definitely consider doing at least a couple of them. Despite the crowds for the tram tour, the walking trails were surprisingly quiet (it seems most people are content with just the tram tour) so you can enjoy listening to the sounds of the jungle and hearing the lions calling unnervingly close by. The paths are dimly lit to preserve the experience (so be careful with young children) but we loved how the dimly lit paths made it really feel like we were in a jungle with unknown wildlife just around the corner. There's also a Creatures of the Night show we shows a couple of times throughout the night, consider this if you have small children as they will love it - but it can be missed if you've seen similar shows (owls, otters, pythons) before. The Night Safari is definitely worth a visit especially if you like animals, it was one of our favourite attractions on our trip to Singapore. You'll need about an hour if you just want to do the tram tour, and about 2-3 hours if you want to do the tram tour and all 4 walking trails.

We went on a weekday 9.15pm session. We arrived at 8ish so that we could wait in line. There are cute shops and heaps of places to eat as well as a fire show (you'll have to google times for this as i can't recall) so after we had a look around we stood in line at around 8.45pm. Even though it seemed like it was a huge line, the wait to get onto the actual safari bus wasn't too long so i suggest going for the latest session. We saw the line for the 8.15 session which was almost triple the size of the 9.15 one.

The safari itself is a good length, informative and fun. We got to see most the animals, but there were a few that were hiding or resting. Some animals are close enough to touch (but don't touch them!) which we thought was pretty cool.

Try and catch the Creatures of the night show. We actually weren't planning on going but we got back from the safari just as a show was starting and thought ""why not?"". We were super glad we went as its entertaining and the animals are adorable and the host was really funny!

We skipped the walking paths because we had just arrived that morning in Singapore and were too tired!

All in all, we enjoyed it. I think we got lucky with crowds, so if you can avoid them I think it would be a much more fun experience.

By paying for a tour a meal (very nice too) was included and we had priority so jumped the massive queues. However, the animals are difficult to see in the gloom and the land train on which you travel albeit guiding your view left or right they don’t stop long enough for you to search the semi-darkness to try and find the animals.
In effect this is nothing more than a theme park which may not be what you were or are expecting.

Leslie went well beyond the service either of us has received at other attractions. Leslie walked us through the entire ticket process and give us helpful insights on how to maximize our experience at the park, even spending some time in the park with us.

Because the park is relatively dark it was at times difficult to see animals along the bus path. Taking photos can also be difficult with a strict no use of flash policy. You can of course walk other paths after the bus tour where you can get a little closer to the animals.

The zoo was very busy with tourists (crowds) and the queues for the bus were jlong. The restaurant itself had international food and that was actually quite good. They also offer water, tea and coffee as part of the package.

We though about returning to the park during daylight hours but after looking at the zoo map board, we realise see that we had seen most of the animals, if not more at our zoos back home in Australia.

Anyway, worth a look if you have the time.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:24:50.560748

* Animal show was ok , not so amazing as we expected. This show is on first come first serve basis. Even if you are in the queue it does not mean that you would be able to make it .
* Tram ride was the most attractive part , but if you are from India don’t expect much as most of the animals are from India Only and you must have seen them already in Indian zoos .

It has 3 broad segments.

1. Animal Show - This is by far the best segment. It has a carefully orchestrated show that has splendid performances by the animals. They are trained and well cared for. You will find them appearing out of nowhere and also among you but never will you fear or get scared. It is indeed a wonderful and not to miss part.

2. Train ride - this takes you a train ride of the entire place. You will get to see all the animals from a distance. The voice announcements give you an explanation of the animals that you see which is very informative.

3. Trek - you can choose to walk down the entire place. You can see the animals from close and spend as much time as per your liking. Take this if you have sufficient time at hand.

The night safari has many attractions and shows, which you can experience in the trams or by foot. Walking allows you to see all the animals at your own pace, however the area is quite expansive so you need good walking shoes. The tram ride takes you into a free range area that is not accessible by walking and the animals can be viewed in an open environment. Not all animals can be seen, however that didn’t detract from the experience. It would be better to have tram stations scattered around the night zoo to allow guests to get off and on in different parts of the safari, which is available in the zoo.

The fire dancers and first show were cancelled due to the inclement weather but the trams ran like clockwork and the walking trails were open.

The queue for the trams was very long but continually moving so the wait was not unbearable. Once on the tram the adventure began with a slow drive around the park and informative commentary along the way.

Many of the animals which were not on display during our day visit to the zoo were big and bright and active during the evening, it was fantastic. Once our tram journey was over we walked the trails, it was dark, it was raining softly, animals were calling, it was eerie, it was FANTASTIC.

My only suggestion would be to stress to people how much better the experience will be if you keep your voices down. We encountered some very loud people on both the tram and trails which meant we missed sections of the narration and some animals in enclosures as they fled from the noise.

The main problem with a night safari is it's rather difficult to spot animals in the dark. Love the concept and would like to try again with night vision binoculars, but as is, it didn't work for me.

Only cool thing was the different types of hyenas which were well lit and active. Everything else would have been better in the day.

As we arrived at the Night Safari (7pm) we experienced around 2,4 million tourist (exaggerated) who have tried to build a queue.
55 min later our trip started with one of the so called ""trams"" through the whole zoo.
What should I say? Night ... dark .... sleeping animals .... holy sh*...

Well all in all I can highly recommend this tour to all people who like to drive around the city for an hour, stand in line for another hour and then barely see any animals due to missing lights in the park. If you are lucky enough to spot any kind of deer or other deers, they will sleep... cause it's night.
After the great tour (appr. 40min with tram through the zoo) you can wait another 50 min for the returning bus + another hour to the city central.

Plenty of it and it was very tasty. Drinks were extra but served very promptly. The staff were very attentive and obliging. After the meal there was a chance to watch the fire eating display and browse some of the souvenir stalls before boarding the tram for the safari. The queue was very well controlled and boarding the tram was completed with the usual Singaporean efficiency. In next to no time we were off spotting the various species on our way around. The Safari is very well sited and laid out with plenty to interest all ages. The lighting was better than I expected so nothing was missed.

A superb evening out and well worth the money. I can whole heartedly recommend this attraction. Additionally, the money collected does go to wildlife conservation, which is explained with the commentary. Walking back after the tram had dropped us off was all a pretty magical experience.

As you would expect, it is a bit tourist attraction and so was incredibly busy but there are ways to manage this. Booking online in advance is important first, not just because of the small discount to price but to make sure you get the earliest slot at 7.15pm as they do sell out. The other option is to try and go on a weekday instead of a weekend if possible. We arrived on the day at around 5.45/6pm and had dinner there; the buffet looked incredibly busy, but the range of normal stalls offered a great range and we had a really tasty kung pao chicken where one portion was enough to share between two. By the time we’d finished, we went towards to entrance around 6.50 by which time queues had already formed to get into the park. They started letting people in around 7pm, which meant that we missed the fire show but it was worth it to get in earlier and see the first animal show inside. Do this first as the stewards suggest when you enter, but ignore them when they try and funnel you onto the trams when you come out of the show. Everyone else will go this way, leaving the walking trails nearly empty for you to explore. That way, by the time you complete the walking trails in comparative peace, there will be absolutely no queue for the tram to finish the evening. We saw everything there was and we were finished by around 10/10.30 before we caught an uber back to our hotel, about a half hour drive back into the city.",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:25:34.760344

Seeing so many animals at night is very special. The safari is well organised, the trails are easy to follow and there is lots to see. A good variety of animals are represented and you will see most of them, as it is just a few (and it is only a very few) that might decide not to appear where you can see them. The ones you will see though, as a result of exceptionally well designed enclosures, are close and easy to see. You think you are walking through the jungle as there is nothing between you and the animals except a hedge of vegetation and a moat or a pane of glass; a window onto their habitat. We didn't see the show (it was on but full), the firedancers were there outside the barriers and gave a pretty good performance. Our advice, once you get through the barrier, is to take the tram first, as it gives you a great view of the large animals and gets you used to the lighting. Be aware though that you will have to contend with the human animal. Sadly, even at 21.30 our tram had a very badly behaved and noisy child that wasn't controlled by it's parent until the rest of the passengers (and unusually it was all of them) said enough was enough. Then when you wander the trails, there are the talkers that have to share their every thought at a volume that penetrates a 50 metre radius, despite the instruction to walk the trails quietly for the sake of the animals and other visitors. One thing that might encourage quiet is turning down the volume of the music at entrance/shops/food oulets - it's loud, very loud and its African beats can weary the life out of you in a very short time. Then there are the true morons of the species that bang the glass to attract the attention of the animals, despite clear instructions that this is upsetting for the animals and may discourage them from appearing. It didn't happen often, but it is disappointing when it does to see how insensitive man, and indeed woman, can be towards animals. All that said I am glad we did it - many of the animals are wonderful to see and so close you could almost touch them. At times it was magical. On the catering front, our advice would be to eat beforehand or bring something with you, as the food was clearly mass produced and very expensive.

While on a tram, you would experience almost a close encounters with the animals in the vicinity though not all animals are easy to be seen and simply most of them are hiding. The tour guide can be heard and also being dubbed thr voice over but not as clear as you would expect it would be. The trip will only take you 30-40mins to cover all area.

It is awesome to see all the animals when they are active due to the darkness in their habitats. You come really close to the animals when you take take tram around the park. It is included in the ticket and we took the tram twice. The early tram trip was the best.
If you want to go there by public transport you can take the metro to Ang Mo Kio on the North-South line and from there bus nr. 138 to the Singapore Zoo, where also the Night Safari is located. It is cheap and relatively fast.
WARNING.: be aware of that all metro trains and busses in Singapore stops service at midnight 00:00.
So plan your return before midnight. We left the Night Safari so late that we ended up at metro station, Toa payoh. The train simply stopped service and asked us to leave the train.
It was at 00:00hrs and also the busses had stopped service.
We manager to find a taxi on the street and got home to our hotel.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:01.581303

We were collected from our hotel around 18.00 taken elsewhere and then transferred into a larger bus which then deposited us and others at the zoo.

Our guide got us all onto a “tram” ahead of the ordinary (long) queues which took us on a leisurely trip around the zoo with an informed commentary the whole time. Of course, sometimes the animals were not helpful and could not be observed In their areas, either hiding away in their habitat of simply still sleeping, but this is just the luck of the draw. What was fascinating was the lack of fences between us and them (they generally appear to have trenches around each enclosure, but it was difficult to see exactly how they managed this).

Afterwards we had plenty of time to follow the marked walkways around the zoo to observe the animals and stay longer in each place to look carefully and eventually find these nocturnal animals.

Then there was time to grab some food and drink from one of the zoos many food outlets (no fine dining here!), which was exactly what we needed.

Later we rejoined our bus and were deposited back at our hotel - definitely worthwhile and we will return next trip during the day.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:01.969253

Bearing in mind the large number of people there each night, it is very well organised and the timing between aech ""Tram"" means you feel as if you are the only group on the safari.

You see many animals, Elephants, Tigers, Lions, Giraffes, etc., etc. The sight and sounds of the animals make this trip a unique experience. (Unless you have been on a real safari !)

Although the animals are dimly lit with floodlights, my advice is to go on one of the first trams at dusk, because the half light will give you a better view, while still enjoying the magical effect of the darkness.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:02.659331

If you have a 4 park ticket, a visit here combines well with the River Safari, as each takes about 3 hours, and the night safari opens soon after the River Safari closes.

Tickets are timed at 19:15 and every hour after, though you really need to be there at opening to get a full evening of viewing. Arrive about 15 minutes before the timed ticket, as the first animal show starts at that time if you want to see it. There is a tram ride which you need to go on as some parts of the park are only accessible from the tram. Queues are very long at opening time, so it is better to do the walks first and then the tram when the crowds have dispersed.

There are the usual standard animals there, but also ones you are unlikely to see elsewhere.

To get the full experience, I would recommend spending about 3 hours there. It takes over an hour from the city by bus/MRT, but we found that going via Choa Chu Kang rather than Ang Mo Kio to be the easier route. Bus/MRT fare from the city is around S$2.

There are water dispensers all over the park, so you only need to take an empty bottle. Food is available inside the park and outside the entrance to the zoo, both local and fast food, though those at the zoo close around 19:00.

We spent the afternoon visiting the nearby River Safari and finished there about 5 30. We then walked the short distance to the Night Safari and had a meal in the food court. By 6 30 we joined the queue which had already formed.

At 6 45 we were called in to see the ""Creatures of the Night"" show which takes place in an amphitheatre within the park. The best seats were reserved for tour groups so we found ourselves sitting in the wings, but still had a good view.

The show does not start until 7 15 so there was a bit of waiting. I won't spoil the show for you except to say don't volunteer to help unless you are comfortable with snakes.

The show lasted around half an hour and was entertaining, then we were directed to the trams for our Night Safari. The queues are well-managed, but there was quite a wait in queues before we boarded our tram.

We expected to see pretty much the same animals we had seen in the zoo a couple of days previously, but the tour takes you to a different part of the zoo. The lighting is subdued, but you can still see the animals although there wasn't enough light for photos.

Some animals (eg Lions) are in compounds, but others such as deer are free to roam. There is a recorded commentary in English and we got good views of the animals. When the tram had finished its tour which lasted perhaps half an hour we were free to walk along designated paths to re-visit the animals, but after a full day we were tired so we left the park at around 9 30.

Taxis were waiting and there was no queue so our taxi which cost around S$20 had us back to our hotel in Marina Bay by 10pm.

I guess opinions are divided. There was a lot of waiting in line for half an hour or so of animal viewing, but seeing the animals at night was for us a unique experience which we enjoyed.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:09.498627

The object is to view the nocturnal activities of the animals. One walks along an asphalt path to each dimly lit position where a nocturnal species is present in it's natural habitat. I would estimate that we were able to see an animal at about 30% of the positions. The remainder appeared to be empty because the nocturnal animals must have been hiding.

Although we didn't see all the animals but we've seen a decent amount of them so that was pretty cool. However, my only complain is about the public transportation. You won't find any MRT or bus services from the suburb to downtown/chinatown areas after midnight where most visitors are staying. If the Night Safari management doesn't think it's their responsibility to tell people, shame on them! As a night event organizer, don't they think they need to let their guests know so they can better plan their trip? My husband and I were visiting from Vancouver Canada. Our subway closes at around 1:00 am. Hong Kong is another Asian city which is closely competitive with Singapore and their subway service closes at around 1:00 am. Therefore, I would never imagine this actually happened. We appreciated what the park could offered and tried to get the most out of it. So we watched the show, took our time to walk all 4 trails, and at the end took the train ride. It was around 11:20 pm by the time we left the park. Then 10 mins wait for the bus (30 mins ride) to the closest MRT station. We arrived the MRT station a few mins after midnight and found that we were stuck. No more train. We panic but still managed to run to the bus hub downstairs to see if there's any buses to Chinatown, no, no more buses to Chinatown. Then we were told the only way was Taxi. Night Safari opens at 7:15 pm and they even tell people the average time spent is 3-4 hours.

Once there, you can spend three or four hours here if you want. There’s a ‘tram’ ride around the park, which shows you the highlights, and helps you orientate yourself. There are organised shows (which we skipped) and then a whole series of walking trails through the park. There are a great way to see, hear and smell the animals and birds.

Yes, witness a thrilling fire show (fire-twirling and flame-throwing to jungle drumbeats) by ""jungle warriors"" to start your evening adventure. The first show is at 7pm (I think it is performed hourly, the last at 10pm).

My wife and I chose to head right away to join the queue for the ""Creatures of the Night"" Show upon entering the park. We were rewarded with good seats in the middle section (free seating on first-come-first-served basis) and were treated to an entertaining show that featured various noctural animals... there was also the staged commotion in the audience arena... (Oops! Too much said...visit and see for yourselves!).

After the show, we have the option to take a walk through the various trails/tracks or the night tram. We chose the latter for compliemntary guided tram ride, complete with audio commentary in English on the various noctural animals. Fortunately for us, the queue moved pretty quickly (we were told by friends later that we could pay S$10 for express boarding, i.e. queue cutting).

The tram ride was comfortable and gave ample chance to spot the night creatures. It was great viewing the animals from a comfortable distance although we could have taken a walk through the well-planned trails/tracks and spend more time with the night creatures but we didn't have time that evening.

As a resident in Singapore, I have signed up for the ""Friends of Wildlife"" card and can have unlimited visits to all 4 parks for a year (zoo, river safari, night safari and bird park). So perhaps, in my next visit, I will take a walk...

Make sure you are dressed comfortably, and wear some insect repellant in case (or you can cover your arms and legs). I had writen a review of the Zoo already, and will do so for the other 2 parks after my next visits...",11-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:28.707450

Get there early as there are long queues.Also you do see the animals more clearly st dusk rather than when it is dark. The show which we also queued for is great for children but if you are an adult party it is not really worth the queuing. Do try to take at least one of the walking routes as it is very magical walking in the zoo at night. It is adequately lit and a very different experience than by day.,01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:29.025001

There is a show you can attend (which quickly fills up), but the main two things to do are to see the animals on for or by a tram. We went for the 20:15 timed entry ticket and made the mistake of queuing for the tram. Even on a weekday this took fifty minutes, which was pretty tedious. There were trams every few minutes, but not enough to make much dent in the crowds. The journey itself has a commentary as you drive around the zoo and see the various animal enclosures. The animals are not in cages here but rather there are ditches to separate the wild animals from the visitors. Clearly the ditch for the Asiatic lions is wider than that for the antelopes. The nice thing is that you have the impression of seeing the animals in something's close to their natural habitat rather than behind bars. We then explored the walking trails, which cross cross the park, and by the time we returned the tram queue had melted away. In retrospect we would have done the walk first, then returned for the tram. This is a zoo and not a circus, so there is no guarantee you will see any particular animal. When I first came here I saw a row of fishing cats with paws poised above the water, but this time they had gone into hiding. However you will see plenty of wildlife. The zoo is about half an hour taxi from downtown hotels, and there is a taxi rank at the exit so you can get back quite easily. I am puzzled as to why other zoos do not have such a night experience, especially as the one here is wildly popular, so clearly makes plenty of money.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:30.432572

It was a good idea to book the first tram trip at 7.15pm as they put out feed near the front of the enclosures just before the start of that tour so we saw almost every animal. The only drawback (if you don’t go on an organised tour with hotel pickups and drop offs) is working out the best way to get back to your hotel after enjoying all the attractions the Zoo offers as a great deal of time is spent waiting in queues. We enquired about taxi fares and were disappointed the people at the taxi stand initially feigned ignorance about the approximate cost to get to the nearest MRT station. When pressed, they vaguely indicated $20-$30 SD. Their very indifferent attitudes were a poor advertisement for Singapore tourism especially as we have found most Singaporeans to be extremely friendly and helpful. We soon discovered they were “ripping us off”as a shuttle bus to the City was $6 and a local bus was $2.20 to an MRT station next to the bus terminus. We were staying at the Crowne Plaza at Changi Airport. As we weren’t on any organised tour it took us 2 hours to get back using public transport. We had to leave the Zoo at 9.15pm so we didn’t have time to see all of the attractions as the last train left Tanah Merah for Changi Airport at 11.18pm. Such a shame! If you are staying at a hotel some distance from the Zoo make sure you organise your return trip before you go so you don’t get stranded or have to pay a hefty taxi fare.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:38.639550

A limited number of tickets are sold to access at different times. We purchased the 8.15pm slot. We arrived at 7.45pm, and despite being ushered to the front of the massive crowd and allowed to enter at 8pm (thanks to the old folks we had with us), we were unable to make it for the 8.30pm show.

The staff advised us to take the tram first, and go for the 9.30pm show. Big mistake! The queue for the tram took one full hour (despite coming in before the 8.15pm crowd, and being told the queue would clear ""in 10-15 minutes""), and by the time we finished, the 9.30pm show was also full. We could have queued up for the 10.30pm show (45 minutes queue...!) but then we would have had no time to walk around at all.

The biggest issue was that the park was so crowded, that it wasn't fun at all. We remembered the night safari from 10 years ago being such a quiet and magical affair, but this time it was all pushing, shouting, crying kids, queuing, waiting, etc. There wasn't a single quiet moment, and even during the tram ride the people/kids were constantly chatting and shouting.

All this for S$170 for 4 pax after discount, definitely not worth it!

They seriously have to further restrict the number of people per night, otherwise I would not go again.
The way it is now, it looks like a desperate try for profit maximisation without considering the experience the night safari is supposed to offer.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:26:48.122570

Presented our tickets only to told we had to queue to change printed tickets for their Wildlife Reserves Singapore Group ticket. Did that, then told we had to queue to have them checked. The line was past the taxi drop off point on the main road. Once through this checkpoint, some 50 minutes later, you then have to line up for entry to the Night Safari complex. Did this and kept our cools. Unfortunately, left the premises after we heard over the PA system that the wait time for the tram was at least another 90 minutes. We confirmed this with zoo staff. They also advised that the zoo closes at 11.15pm. Doing the maths, we are not going to see much. Would you believe that we also had a queue to leave. What a waste of time and money. Overall, after the taxi ride back to the hotel, spent $130 to have the privilege of lining up. This is one place I will not go back to and you should seriously re-consider.

Their response:
“Regarding tickets, we encourage guests to purchase Park tickets from our official online store in order to skip the ticketing queue, as e-tickets will be emailed to guests, so they do not have to queue again onsite to redeem physical copies of their tickets. For ticket purchases from our partners, we are currently working closely with them to make the ticket redemption process more efficient. In the interim, aside from having self-service kiosks, we have also increased the number of ticketing counters operating on peak nights.

If you go when it opens, head straight for the creatures of the night show. Don’t line up for a tram as the crowds are too large. Get a tram after the show.
There are four walking trails with lots of beautiful animals to see. There is enough lighting in the park so the trails are not dangerous. The tram ride is pretty good and they did slow down so the passengers could get a nice view.
You don’t have to be there at 7:15. You could do the park in three hours, therefore, you could leave it for a bit and get there after the crowd has spread out. There are a lot of people lining up at the start and it is quite crowded, so go to the show first.
Unfortunately there will be times where visitors will have a poor attitude. Other visitors and staff don’t have to put up with that.

We purchased the tickets in the Chinatown information, which we received a piece of paper, stating we had the tickets and paid. This changed when we got there, we had to Q to get actual tickets, this was 40 minutes at least. Then we went for the safari train, this involved another long Q, not good. Once on the train the trip around the park was good, except some of the animals must have been tucked up in bed. After the train trip is complete you can walk various trails, certainly different at night with the animals very close.
There is a various amount of food stalls, all looked ok, but we didn’t try any, because we were getting late for the coach home. I would get the night safari bus from your hotel, excellent value at $11 per person return. Last return coach at 23.00.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 15:27:04.153694

they take you into the dense jungles in an open train where you get to see a huge variety of wild animals up there in the open.
the novel experience here is that you are open and so are the animals
in spite of their wild nature none of them dares to leave their open enclosures or wander into the enclosures of other animals to grab a fast bite.
a lot of training or maybe sedation or maybe electrical fencing God knows, but altogether it is a thrilling experience.

Coming to Night safari, first take the Tram and see cover most of the places in an hour. White lion is the highlight. After tram, you must walk to at-least certain portions to feel that forest atmosphere. It will be so good to walk in between dark trees with animals suddenly popping out. So good. Don't miss it by just taking Tram.

We were given a 19:15 time to arrive and joined a huge, badly managed queue with people leaving the roped area to push back in. After over 30 minutes we got on the vehicle for the trip with a number of very young children who cried sporadically during the safari, they were too young to understand what was happening, and possibly tired. Throughout the 30 minute ride passengers were taking flash photos with their phones, which ruined night vision for a few minutes after each photo, it also affected the animals we were trying not to disturb. The walking part of the safari was far more enjoyable as it was much quieter. The animals were well presented and there were staff about to guide and answer questions. Had I not been before I might have been more positive, but the long queues and behaviour of certain individuals on the Night Safari meant I did not enjoy this experience as much as I expected to, and it would not be at the top of a list of things I would recommend to people visiting Singapore.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:27:07.119193

Traffic was slow heading out of town and the taxi fare was expensive at $55. Fortunately we shared with another couple who were also going to the zoo and were in the taxi queue next to us. We'd bought our tickets online so we went straight in and didn't have to wait long for the tram. During the tram ride we were able to see many of the animals even though it was quite dark, so don't expect brightly illuminated enclosures as the animals' comfort rightly has the priority. We ate dinner there after the tram ride and the quality and serving size was good from our chosen outlet. After that we walked on some of the other trails. Again, we were able to see most of the animals and even closer than the tram. For example, the wallaby trail allows you to see them up close. Also you might get another chance to see some of animals you missed on the tram. We saw the rhinos happily munching away from the trail yet when we went past on the tram earlier they were mostly submerged. Also a few times we heard the lion roaring in the distance as we walked the trails. I anticipated swarms of mosquitoes and other biting insects but was pleasantly surprised. Getting back home was faster and cheaper because we were offered a $6 per person bus trip back to town at a drop off point very close to our hotel. The only downside was having to wait about 20 minutes for the bus to depart. I'd say you would enjoy the night safari more if you made it a separate zoo trip rather than going after a long day of other outdoor activities or being at the zoo already during the day.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:27:13.337752

* Many of the fancy animals didn't make an appearance -- giraffe was hiding (!), rhino was sleeping, and there weren't enough cats on the way. This might be simply bad timing, I remember enjoying the night walk through the zoo and next time I will do this and skip the tram.
* Previously I had my young son with me, and that may have made the tram ride more interesting.
* Too many talkative people on the tram. It's annoying but what can you do? They're clearly enjoying themselves.

It might be amusing for ones with little children and i have noted there are some changes on the walking trails.

The shows after the tram ride do not have coverage for audience or for the stage, so as soon as it started to rain, the show was cancelled. Singapore gets over 100 inches of rain a year--so WHY are the show venues not covered? All, the vending & food areas were covered.

So, you should do both trips. First by feet and after this by car because no one is waiting if you come back after the first round. In summary we needed 3.5h for both tours and every minute was nice and never boring. If you have the possibility to use a red light flash you can make sensational pictures. An usual flash light is not allowed and this absolutly correct for the reason the animals will lose there night view if people use flash lights.

Animals seem to be disturbed at night time. As they were locked in and dim flashlights were on them for us to spot them.
Safari Experience - To get into the Night Safari park it took more than 45 mins to 1 hour. Highly frustrating. Advice to people - KEEP DRINKING WATER HANDY all the time.
To get into a Tram we waited for more than an hour. It turned out more frustrating. AN ADVICE to the administration people, please don't try accommodating too many people at one go OR if you want to, please have more arrangements and space. It was quite hot and humid day, everyone standing in the queue full of sweat and frustration, especially kids were crying, there should have be more Air coolers, Trams, or less people at one go.

Advice to Visitors - Avoid going on Weekends. Also, if you plan to visit Singapore Zoo that will be better idea because you will enjoy with kids better in day time having to see more animals. We did visit Singapore Zoo same day with Night Safari and felt that we should have gone with the zoo only.

Night Safari had one AVERAGE Animal Show (host was good) on first come first serve basis running every hour. We had to wait for another 1.5 hours for that, as the house was full.

You have two options to explore the area: either walk the four trails or take the tram ride - the latter option is the reason why people go. We purchased tickets for 8.15pm entry, which wasn't as crowded.

The only downside is that it can be quite difficult looking or finding the animals in the dark, particularly if you have poor eyesight. There is also no flash photography allowed therefore any photos you take would be poor unless you decide to bring a professional camera.

Tip: try to avoid sitting towards the end of the tram (if possible). Our tram driver would slow down to allow sufficient time for the first carriage to view the animals. However once it was the middle/last carriage's turn to drive past, he would speed up and we didn't have time to look.",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:28:18.333010

We booked through Viator and then the company was RMG tours. Take deep breaths, it is a bit like Being herded or on a school trip. Our guide was great, though quite officious and bossy. Expect to be transported to a bigger bus after collection from hotel. Overall they were efficient. Don't be put off by other reviews just know what to expect. The night safari makes it worth it and you get priority admission and a priority tram ride. We didn't watch the show but did do a walk after the tram ride where we saw some smaller creatures.

We pre-purchased our 8.15pm tickets through our hotel and after the 30 minute Uber from Robertson Quay we joined the hordes or people who were lining up for the ‘trams’. After a long wait, we did enjoy the journey around the park, and the opportunity to see so many beautiful animals quite close was great - but once the ride was over, that’s where things really ended for us.

We went to the Creatures of the Night show, and left 10 minutes in. We felt that the animals didn’t look at all comfortable, but probably what put us off the most was others in the crowd. Even after being asked not to, the audience were continually taking flash photos (a big no-no) as well reaching out to touch the poor animals as they were paraded last by their handlers (an even bigger no-no). We realise this isn’t the park’s fault as you can’t control absolutely everyone, but I feel that patrons should be ejected for such behaviour, particularly given the amount of times the animal’s welfare and the park’s commitment to conservation were mentioned during the tram ride.

If you are going to go, I recommend a few things:

- Bring water with you. There wasn’t an opportunity to purchase any once you got into the line (and trust me, you don’t want to lose your place!) and keep your bottle once it’s empty. There is a water filling station near the Creatures of the Night show. We also noticed that the food and beverage prices at the park were very high, which is to be expected I guess.

- Try and sit on the right hand side of the tram if you can. You’ll see the Lions and Rhinos on your side, and for us this was a highlight.

- Be prepared to wait in a lot of lines.

- Use Uber to get to and from - there’s free wifi at the park, and you’ll easily be able to get a ride. I think we paid $30SGD to get there, and about $18SGD to get back to Robertson Quay.

- If your hotel room has one of the ‘handy’ devices (the wifi-enabled device you can take with you around Singapore) check the offers as there is likely to be ticket discounts on offer. After booking, we noticed that if we had booked it through this system we would have saved 30% on the entrance fee.",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:28:19.093815

This is a zoo not a safari, but the animals seem fairly relaxed and are very visible. My advice is to ignore the trams and the show and the crowds and to make the effort to walk and you will be very well rewarded. The trails are good, well marked and easy to follow even in the dark.

First time to visit. We booked 20:15 one and got there around 19:45, however, the waiting line for the tram was already super long, and it took us 45 mins to start the tour.
The worst part is that we couldn't attend the Creatures of the Night Show.
Our tram tour finished just before 21:30, and we rush to the show, but the staff said the show is full and we couldn't attend.
This is VERY unprofessional.
A woman, who also couldn't attend the show, was claiming that why they sell so many ticket and many people cannot enjoy the show even though the ticket price is same.
That is so true.
We paid same price, and some could enjoy the show and some couldn't.
21:30 is the last show of the weekday.

I went there with my guest who came over from Japan and she was VERY disappointed. Me too.
This is what they should announce more clearly.
If you want to enjoy the show, go there by 19:00, and enjoy show from 19:30, then get on the tram tour from 20:15, and enjoy walking trail till the safari is closed.
This is only the way you can enjoy all of the safari. I hope you don't waste money.

日本から来た友人と初めて訪れましたが、ハイライトの一つであるショーが満席で見られませんでした。

初めてだったので色々調べたのですが、よくわからず、ひとまず20:15分のチケットとやらを予約し、19:45に現地に到着、スタッフに言われるまま、トラムの列に並びましたが、乗り込めたのは20:30を過ぎた頃でした。
それ自体は楽しめたのですが、その日の最後のショーが21:30からで、その直前にトラムによるツアーが終了したので、ショーに急いだのですが、入り口で何やら人が揉めています。
どうやら席が満席なので入れない、ということでした。
海外から来たと思われる白人の女性がスタッフに詰め寄っていましたが、同じ金額を払って、しかも時間通りにツアーに参加しているにも関わらず、ショーが満席で見えない、しかもその回で終わりとのことで、「ショーの分のお金を返金しろ」という彼女の主張はあながち間違ってないような気もしました。
ショーが見られなかったせいで、せっかくのナイトサファリでの経験が残念なものになりました。

トラム以外にも徒歩で回るっコースも別にあるため、ショー、トラム、徒歩のすべてを楽しむためには19時には現地に遅くとも着いて、19:30からのショーを見た後に20:15からのトラムにのり、その後、徒歩のコースを楽しむのが良いかと思います。",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:28:45.482970

However what really is nice, that a lot of enclosures are huge that you are not allowed to go there by foot. Of course you'll sometimes have a platform where you can see part of the enclosure, but never guaranteed that you'll see an animal.
The trains which drive you through the enclosures are very relaxing, however you cannot decide how long you'll be in a certain enclosure.

We arrived in plenty of time but so did bus, after bus, after bus of other tourists. There was not hundreds but thousands of people. We were made to line up in massive cattle runs and stood waiting to get on the safari trains. It was EXTREMELY hot and raining off and on. We waited over an hour and were still a long way from getting in. Having had recent knee surgery it was becoming very uncomfortable to continue standing so we decided to cut our $90 loss and leave. We were asking to be let out but the lady insisted we speak to a manager. By this stage we had been at the zoo for 3+ hours. The manager offered to get us on the next train which was great. We boarded with great anticipation only to find there was no animals. Everything was either asleep or hiding from the rain, plus it was SO dark in there you couldn’t see anything. VERY disappointing.

Go mid week
Book your tickets online in advance
When you arrive don't join the queue for the tram, instead do the walking trails- you'll see a lot more animals than on the tram. It took us less than 2 hours to do these and its possible to stop half way around and get the tram back. Make sure you take lots of water and insect repellent. Walk slowly and quietly and you will see lots of animals very close up.
If you arrive early in the evening and do the walking trails immediately, by the time you've finished the trails it will be later in the evening and you can go on the tram (with no queues!) and see the few animals that you can't see on the walking trail. Although we enjoyed the tram ride, we found that it went a bit too quickly to have enough time to see all the animals. Also, other tourists are noisy!
Food choice is a bit limited if you want to eat later.
Its easy to get an Uber here from other parts of Singapore.
The time on your ticket refers to the time you can enter the night safari park, it isn't the time for getting on the tram- you can do this any time.
Make sure you go in the bat enclosure!
We've been to a lot of zoos and we thought the night safari was excellent- a very different experience to other zoos that we've visited in the day time.",08-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:29:03.221931

Tram ride into rainforest was fantastic. We covered all 4 walking trails, I would recommend to do those trail but if not then tram ride is must.
TIP: once entered the park head directly for the queue at creatures of the night show, it starts at 7.30pm. Usually there will be long queue to go on tram ride first but this can be done later as tram frequency is 5 to 10 mins. Show are 2 times and first come first serve basis.

We arrived for the 7:15pm entry and headed for the creatures of the night show at 7:30pm. The show was very staged and we were slightly disappointed but I guess we might be showing our age as the shows target audience was definitely children. If you have young children we would definitely recommend. The show lasts half an hour but get there early if you want to get a seat as they stop letting people in when it is full. We were slightly confused as to why some of the seating was reserved when we were told you can't possibly reserve seating???

After the show finished we headed for the tram which there was a long que for so get out of the show quickly to avoid the que. the tour was ok, they crammed the tram full so we couldn't see everything which was annoying. The elephants were incredible and so were the lions, make sure you take a good camera as you'll never see anything like them again. The tram ride lasted about 45mins and then you are able to walk around the park but there are some bits you can't access again (like the elephants.)

We went on a Saturday night at 7pm, but it was not peak season and F1 was going on the same weekend so it was not crowded at the night safari at all. We pre-bought our tickets online, which saved a little time. We showed up at 7 and queued for 10 minutes to enter the night safari. Upon entering, we saw that everyone was heading for the tram first, so we headed to the show instead. We got straight in and got second row seats without any queues. The show was quite underwhelming. It is only 30 minutes long and the first 5 minutes are spent telling the audience not to use flash while taking pictures. Why does it take a whole 5 minutes to do this? Because they do it in every language they know (English, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Hindi, Malay, etc.)! Useless because people still annoyingly used flashes. When they finally do start the show, they just basically parade out a few animals one by one and tell you some fun facts about each one. There is a Binturong, owl, snake, hyena, cat and otter. They make the otter do a silly trick to throw out some garbage. The other animals are shown on stage while they talk about it. After the show we went to the tram and only had to queue for 15 minutes. The line moves very quickly because a tram comes every 5 minutes. The tram ride has a recorded English commentary, not a live person talking like on the Disney animal kingdom or San Francisco zoo tram ride. The tram ride lasts for 40 minutes, during which time you struggle to see all the animals in the dark while the tram spends a few seconds at each enclosure. Again, people were ignoring instructions and used their flash to take pictures throughout the ride. Every 5 minutes the driver asked passengers not to use flash, but they ignored him and continued to do so until the very end. The no flash rule wasn't enforced and the driver just had to keep giving useless reminders that went ignored. If you don't use a flash it is impossible to take any pictures unless you have night vision mode on your camera like the very prepared couple sitting next to us. After the tram ride we did all 4 of the walking trails. The trails are dark and quiet and not crowded at all. We enjoyed this the most of everything, but there were some animals that were too difficult to see in the dark, like the giant flying squirrels. I don't know why, but they weren't flying around when we were there and we didn't spot a single one. Surprisingly, many of the animals were asleep despite the fact that they were supposed to be nocturnal. Overall, the experience was just ok but not something we will return again for.

Tip: They allow you to bring in outside food and drink, so we brought our own sandwiches and ate them while waiting in line. Also bring mosquito repellent.",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:29:20.470788
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JJOH,525287346,18-09-2017,5,Definitely what you make of it,"So many of you will have noticed that reviews of this attraction are decidedly mixed.IMHO that is for two reasons
A) animals are notoriously unpredictable and no matter how skilful you are at creating a zoo as a viewing attraction you can't stop those pesky critters hiding away from view some of the time. Infuriatingly they resort to their natural behaviours and hide away from potential danger or the elements or stay still precisely because they are designed to be hidden from view from predators or prey
B) we are a very mixed society but increasingly we are a species of limited attention span who think everything they want in life should magically be delivered on their laps without any effort.

So don't be surprised that the numerous people we observed running noisily at great pace around the zoo in the dark saw very little. Had they stayed with people who had patience and kept their mouths shut for a few minutes they might have been pleasantly surprised. And if they could have resisted banging on glass windows funnily enough the animals may not have wandered off.
We visited on GP night so maybe not too busy. There were no queues. It is true that it appears that no matter what time slot you bury they just seem to let you in and I think the zoo should r econsider this particularly at busier times. There are basically three things to do, there is a tram ride with live commentary by the driver through some of the animal enclosures; several different walking trails and a show where they have a few animals that hey show to you. The ride is quite good and the teams are spacious and impressively quiet. We saw quite a lot if different creatures out and about. The trails were my favourite and reward the patient and quiet visitor. It's surprising what you miss if you don't put a bit if effort in. The show was ok and worth a look. It takes about 30 mins although they could shorten the somewhat lengthy intro but again that is in an attempt to ensure that the crowd don't scare the animals with flash photography. Of course that is such a difficult task because humans whether through stupidity or wilfull disobedience seem to find it impossible to accede to even the most reasonable request!

I've never come across anything similar elsewhere. The design of the zoo is fantastic and we had a great night and would highly recommend. Lastly if anyone has done a few safaris you will know that it is hit and miss what you see one day to the next. The same applies to the animals in a zoo which is really part if the fun.

To be fair we may have been unlucky on our visit in August. Firstly the crowds, literally thousands descended on the place which supposedly has three entry times between 7.30 and 9.30 each evening. Organisation was non-existent, pre-purchased tickets still had to be machine authenticated and guaranteed a position at the end of a never ending snaking queue of people. After waiting in the masses for at least 20minutes after our scheduled 7.30 entry time and with patience running out we scrambled to find somebody official and was eventually nonchalantly told that the 7.30 people can go through an unmarked entry at the side. This was the start and stop of our safari! On the other side long queues of people herded into Disney style pens waited for the open sided trains to drop of passengers after the loop tour. When we eventually boarded we were driven round various open and closed compounds with a pre-recorded commentary describing the animals as we approached each area. The areas with dangerous animals were skillfully created to give the impression of roaming free and I'm sure the zoo has very high standards of care and responsibility for these creatures. Unfortunately lighting was obviously fairly dim throughout and several animals, bored with the constant intrusion and had slinked away for some peace and quiet.

They have a english voice over and the driver slows down by each of the animal stops so you can see them and take photos if you can (NO FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY ALLOWED)

They also offer a walking tour which you can do and walk it instead of doing the tram OR you can do both, tram and the walk. They have a walking trail which takes up to 1hour to do the whole thing.

Tips

Arrive before your ticket time to line up! Arrive at least 30 min probably 45 before your ticket time.

Once you get in DONT GO ON THE TRAM. Everyone will rush for the trams. Instead start with the Wallaby Walkway. You will avoid the crowds and get great opportunity to observe the animals with few people about.

I would suggest going on the tram ride about 9:40pm there was no line then.",08-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:29:31.762592

Unfortunately getting into the safari makes me question if it was worth going. We ordered our tickets online. Which was pointless. The line to get your online ticket printed was longer ban the line to buy tickets. After waiting in this line we thought we should buy the priority pass, but all we're sold out. We were there an hour before the show even started. Then we moved to the next line which was much much longer. We were lucky and got to see a fire show while waiting in line. Once we finally arrived it was a mad dash to the creatures of the night show. This was the highlight of the whole place. After that we took a tram and then walked around. Once inside it was fun, but the lines and chaos of getting in was just terrible, and it seems like they should be able to figure this out.

I had been told by many previous visitors that the Night Safari was an absolute must. After visiting for myself I'm not entirely sure why. We booked online prior to our arrival in Singapore, I'd strongly recommend this for quicker entry into the park. We paid one of the open-top bus companies for our transfers. I actually enjoyed the journey there more than the attraction itself. We were booked onto the 8:30pm tour. We queued for more than one hour 30 minutes to get into the attraction. It was poorly managed, chaotic and stiflingly hot. When we eventually boarded one of the 'trams' we embarked on a 40 minute journey around the zoo. The concept is fantastic and if it were to be better organised I'm sure this could be a super attraction. The tour guide on the tram was knowledgeable and reeled off his script without hesitation, he'd clearly done it a few times. Due to the length of the queues we missed the 'Creatures of the Night Show'. If you are planning a visit, go as early as possible so that you can fit in all that queueing. I feel we paid to spend an excruciatingly long time queuing for absolutely no reason. We managed to catch a glimpse of the Fire Show. But again, this was restricted due to the queuing. Once we disembarked from the tram, we had to leave the park almost immediately to catch the final bus back to the city which was at 10:30pm. Ensure you have arranged transport back to the city as it was crazily busy at 10:30pm and a mad rush for every cat, man, dog and woman to get their transport back to the city. It's such a shame that we couldn't have enjoyed this attraction more. The feeling of excitement once we were on the tram, travelling in darkness around the zoo was unfortunately completely overshadowed by the mismanaged queues. My advice: don't believe the hype.",08-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:29:32.518440

The tram is supposed to be a great way to see more, but the queue looked like it was going to take upwards of an hour so we didn't wait. I don't think this was helped by the tram stops mostly being closed with only the one at the entrance being available on the night we visited. I think if we did this again, we'd pay for the queue jump for the trams. If you only have time for this, or the zoo, I'd say go for the zoo.

We'd pre-purchased from The hippo and duck tour people ahead of time and got out there to find the first two ""shows"" we were in time for sold out. They call them shows but they are actually queue groups for their trams. So If you are in an 20:15 ""show"" you get to stand in a queue at 19:05.... They open the barrier for your group at 20:15.... You go through with literally 100s of others. We then queued a further 45 mins to get to the next ticket barrier and 55 mins altogether to get on a tour tram. Which I think lasted 30-40 minutes. They will tell you are other 'attractions'...
*Restaurants - which we couldn't go into because we spent all our time queuing (dinner consisted of a bag of peanuts).
*Creatures of the night show - the first two when we arrived in that I area were sold out and we couldn't go into either anyhow because all our time was spent queuing.
*5 Short walks... You guessed it we didn't have time to do these with we couldn't go into because we spent because of the time queuing.
*There was a Borneo fire juggling group at the beginning but unless they had actually stood on a roof I couldn't have seen them from my place in the queue.

First to say it is an entirely different park to the zoo and hence maybe too much to do the zoo and this in the same day if you want to do both justice.

This is a tram ride around the park (about 40mins) then you can walk it after to see some more animals (60+ mins). It is a bit of a chaotic start with everyone arriving at once so be prepared.

Also, as you might have guessed... it's dark so animals can be harder to spot and photos are all but impossible (even with a full frame slr). But still it is nice to see the animals in a different mode to the standard zoo arrangement.",07-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:30:00.000020

Firstly, you no longer have an option to buy a ticket without tram ride. There is only one option with the tram ride at an exorbitant rate of $45. Never fancied the tram rides as you end up wasting more time queuing and waiting for the trams to come and how are you going to see any animals if you are just going to whizz pass them on a tram especially since everywhere is so dark?! Isn't the whole idea of going to a zoo a leisurely experience of observing animals at your own pace?

Secondly, they have timed entries now so you can't just stroll in at your own pace after buying the tickets. We arrived at 6 and by then, the 715pm tickets were sold out and we had to settle for 815pm. Within the next few minutes, all the 815pm tickets were snapped up also leaving only 915 and 1015 tickets left. What do they expect people to do at the reception area for 3 hours? People also started to queue 1 hour before their entry time so everyone ended up being herded like cattle for about an hour. Not sure if this is a result of oversubscription of tour groups or the bad policy of every ticket a tram ticket and as a result an over capacity of trams and the need for such extreme crowd control.

Lastly, the entire area is plagued by the problem of poor signages. We couldn't find the toilet around the entire area and there was no indication at all that we were queuing at the wrong queue for tour tickets collection and we had to rejoin another queue again. What is the point of having bright and colorful tv screens displaying useless info. To add insult to the injury, the lady who sold us the tickets, Jenny, was especially rude and condescending towards us and even found the need to rebuke me as I was having a conversation with my husband about how I never remembered the ticket to be so expensive. Yes I appreciate the few dollars of local discount I am getting but for the great deterioration in experience since I last visited, I highly doubt I would ever step foot in this place ever again in my entire lifetime.

I get why tourists would want to visit this place for its novelty factor but there are much better ways to spend your night in the city with better value. Go see the beautiful night scene instead of the non-existent animals here.",07-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:30:08.978526

We stayed around the Quay area which took us about 45 minutes in a cab to get to the zoo as it was rush hour.

We booked our tickets online and managed to save a small amount and ensure we secured a place as we were told of its popularity.

To be honest the que was a nightmare, we were queuing for a while with a large amount of extremely excited children (should of packed some ear plugs).

Once at the front of the line we jumped onto a bus (golf buggy like) which took a large group of us on the night safari.

The actually tour was great but only lasted a short time. The animals were incredible and once approaching them the wait was worth it.

However I wouldn't recommend bringing your high tech cameras as flash photography is not allowed and due to the cart moving through out the tour it's extremely difficult to get a good night mode shot.

The idea of the night safari is great but the crowds for the trams are pretty long and whilst the tram ride is informative and relaxing it's obviously hit and miss with the animals given they have open pens.

As they are nocturnal animals the lighting doesn't assist for photos. It cost us around $25 to and $40 from the safari in a cab and there was no issues in getting a cab home at the time we were leaving ( circa 10pm)

The crowds were ridiculous, thousands of people. The fire show on the way in was good - wish we could have stood and watched it all the way through but you have to move with the queue. We passed on the tram ride, instead doing the whole park on foot. That suited us much better as it was way less crowded,we could go at our own pace and we could see more animals than you could from the tram. We saw some beautiful animals and the information boards were good too. I did wonder if the enclosures were big enough for some animals that would naturally have a big range.

We didn't make it to the shows as there was plenty to see besides these, and there were some rare animals such as pangolins that you could only see on foot that were worth checking out.

Booked it through our hotel. A bus picked us up from the hotel at about six and the journey took about 30 minutes or so. There is places to have food and drink at the zoo and gift shops also.
The night safari is very different to going to the normal zoo. In that you are on a tram which goes through the zoo and stops at each animal viewing area which seams only a few feet away and there are no bars or cages except for the one that houses the tiger. Very eerie and scary especially the Lions which adds to the experience. The whole journey takes about an hour.
I took a lot of photos but was not allowed to use the flash in case it startled the animals so have none that are any good because of the darkness.
There are two other shows available to see after the tram journey but you would be waiting a long time, as the place is very crowded. Seen the fire eating act while we were having some food, which is not bad.

I definitely recommend booking a tour from your hotel so that you can get the priority line and not have to stand in long lines with those who just drive into the park. It will get you on the tram earlier and give you more time to look around. You can always take a cab back to your hotel if you desire to spend more time at the park.

I hoped that things would change but after seeing the show it wasn't so special as I hoped it to be. It was very similar like the one I saw 10 years ago.
Girlfriend and I went on a day where there were a several huge groups of tourist, so it was really crowded during the show and don't even get me started on waiting for the tram around the Safari.
Due to a lot of people waiting for the tram, we decided to walk the path and I must say if you aren't tried and are able to walk then do so by all means. You get to see so much more Animal than being on the tram which only takes you on a set path which shows like around 5 exhibits when there are 30 to see *Number not accurate*.
Walking the path took around an hour but it was worth it.
For the price you pay and what you get from it, I wouldn't go again any time soon.
The Animal show is around 30 min, it is cool to watch it again.
MUST BRING - Mosquito/bug repellent
Since you can't use camera flash on the different exhibits, it is really hard to take any photo with your phone and even with my camera. Sometimes you can't even see where the Animal is hiding :P
Due to the night surcharge which was around 6 SDG more, so in the end it cost me 27 SDG from the Night Safari to get back to my hotel (Marina Mandarin Singapore)",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:30:35.087689

When you need to leave at 2230 to get the last MRT it doesn't leave you much time.
The creature show is cancelled during wet weather- it rains a lot in the evening in Singapore... on a week night that is the only other attraction.

Recommendations- arrive early, before your time slot. We arrived at our time slot and still queued.
Later looked clearer, perhaps do the tram last rather than first.
The trails are worth the walk and fairly quiet. Bring wet weather gear!

For the price and the trouble to get there (MRT and bus which only took around 50mins) and the queuing involved once there I can't recommend the experience.

Passing through ''enclosures', with barriers built using natural materials that give a feel of openness. Lots of kids, so it's a noisy experience, but was interesting to see the nocturnal animals awake. Although dark, they use artificial moonlight. There is a 'creatures of the night' show and two trails, which you can walk in the darkness and see animals in their enclosures.

The children on our tram screamed at the animals and too many adults on the tram used flash and were not supposed to because the flash disturbs the animals and can provoke epilepsy in those susceptible. Had people controlled their kids' screaming, and had the tram operator not have to repeatedly ask the offenders not to use flash, I would rate the venue a five. We enjoyed seeing all the animals feeding. We saw more active animals in this venue than in zoos in daytime when they would be sleeping. The tapir was amazing and so close to the tram we thought we could pet him! The white lions were absolutely majestic glowing in the dark in the light.
The hippo, water buffalo, hyenas, and the other animals were beautiful. The recording of the female narrator was excellent.
A few of her ""rights"" and ""lefts"" were incorrect as far as which animal was where, but we saw them clearly anyway.
We arrived at 7:30 and chose to take the 8:15 tram. I think the next time we would eat a bit and then take the 9:15 tram as that one seemed less crowded. The food and beverages are a bit more expensive but that is to be expected. The toilets are immaculate as is typical of Singapore. The sink bowls are in the shape of large white flowers.

However, once we got there - wow!
We went on a Monday night and so benefited from it being pretty quiet.

What didn't come over from other reviews is - the team runs every 5 to 10 minutes, not only at the entrance times advertised; those appear to be more about controlling the number of people in the park.

The tram trip is well done - the animals clearly get fed to keep them at the front of their pens. The commentary is informative but not obtrusive. It does go for about 40 mins and is a great way to get your bearings.

We then walked around too and enjoyed the ability to get within 30cm (& strengthened glass) from tigers, leopards etc + the thrill of walking through bush as the Lions roared.

The zoo was incredible and well laid out with many different feeding times for the animals. The selection of animals available to see was phenomenal and it's easy to see why this is the best zoo in Asia.

So buy your tickets online. The second encounter was queueing for the trams that take you around the park, after a 55 minute wait we eventually got on one. The next encounter was the inability to see the animals. When there was a good oppurtunity to take photos (no flashes) the tram would not stop. The next encounter was the live animal show, another queue but a lot faster than the first only 25 minute wait. The presenter was talented enough to keep the crowd entertained but only five animals were presented. They are talented but having seen the bird and seal show at Taronga Zoo Sydney this show was ordinary in comparison. The next encounter was the visit had come to an end and the experience was to get back into town. Word of advice would be
1. Buy your tickets online
2. Book your transport or use the MRT and buses, taxis are expensive
3. Don't go on the tram, take the walkways you are likely to see more and get some great photos.
4. The show is alright, but get to the first one. This will allow you to see more.

The worst thing I have done in my whole trip in Singapore is to have booked a shuttle with SAEx from Balestier to Night Safari. I paid but no bus show up.
(OK for Night Safari, watching animals at night is still a great fun. But I spent a lot of time queuing up to redeem a ticket - not even buying it - and queuing up just to enter the park! I was late so it didn't leave me sufficient time for the visit, thanks to SAEx.)

This is the story: I went to the SAEx website and check out a return trip for two from the cart, after selecting my departure times at Balestier and Night Safari -- a time a selected on their system. So transaction completed, and I thought it's settled. But there was actually no confirmation that a bus will be waiting for me (at where and when). The worst thing I could imagine happened. There's no bus coming at the time I 'booked' at my departure stop.

So I called the '24-hour hotline' +65 6753 0506 to seek assistance. No one is picking up the phone. Eventually I called the Night Safari Guest Relations for help. That's when I learned that the SAEx bus is supposed to pass through my stop according to the timetable no matter what and I should be able to hop on the bus. (And I have waited for half and hour. Nothing came.)

Same logic -- if the SAEx booking system allows me to book a bus returning from Night Safari to Balestier at 12:05 a.m., there should be a bus for me to hop on anyway. I asked the guy standing at the 'City Transfer' booth, which according to Night Safari is the booth of SAEx. The guy said there's no bus and all SAEx staff should have gone home. I hop on a taxi immediately. If there's a bus on 00:05, shouldn't the company leave someone here to guide the passengers?

Extremely terrible service. To conclude:
1. Night Safari should not have recommended SAEx on their website.
2. SAEx should be forbidden from charging their passengers beforehand, if the bus is not coming anyway.
3. OK if the booking thing is going on, SAEx should tell the passenger when and where the bus will come.
4. If the passenger finds that the bus is not coming, the '24-hour hotline' should be available to the confused passenger.
5. The 'timetable' of SAEx is extremely confusing, especially when I am allowed to book a trip that may not exist on the system.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:31:19.459453

(Not necessary to book a tour you can do it yourself),"This was right at the top of our ""must do"" list for Singapore and quite rightly. We opted not to book a ""tour"" that included transport but booked our own tickets (really easy via their website) - we had planned on using public transport but our hotel told us it was quicker and only a few dollars more to just take a cab which we did. We arrived too early for our tour and rather that eat at one of the fast food outlets opted for the more expensive buffet restaurant which was an excellent choice - delicious food.

We then entered the main park at our ticket time and within a few minutes were on a tram on our safari. Yes it is a bit false (like most of Singapore) but you are in the middle of a city and are not really going to see animals roaming wild like on a real safari - still an excellent experience. We found some of the walking trails a little confusing and started on one and finished on another (that we thought was quite a distance away) - but the whole evening was thoroughly enjoyable and we are delighted we did it",03-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:31:56.042881

No flash photography allowed and impossible to take photos due to light and distance. Nocturnal Animals presentation was quite good but very ""staged"" and deliberate - duration 30 minutes.

The buffet was reasonable.

The night safari train guide was well spoken and informative even if the script they read from seemed repetitive at times.

We came to see the big cats (lions, leopard and tigers) and we weren't disappointed, we were lucky enough to see one of the large male lions wandering and roaring! Other notable animals included the hyenas, elephants, flamingos, fishing cat, giraffes and zebras. Also on the walks we saw more of the smaller animals like the slow loris as cute as they are.

I would recommend wearing some bug spray as you are in the ""middle of the jungle"" as our guides put it so expect mosquitoes and other insects, although being from Australia we're used to this.

As we were out on Sentosa at the Shangrila hotel and because the safari is quite a way out of the city we did not wish to do this ourselves. Because we were already out there for the river safari we were in fact front of the queues and went on the first tram unlike others I would not recommend getting off the tram when it is busy as it would be very hard to get back on again instead do the full circuit and then do the walking trails. I wished I had more time to do all 4 walking trails as that is definitely the best bit if just a bit creepy when no others are around. With hindsight would not have bothered with the creatures of the night show which took up a load of time for what it was and done more on the walking trails.

From downtown the zoo is located about 40+ miles from downtown. We used our SMRT tourist pass and took the train to the end of the east line and then crossed to the bus terminal and took the bus to the end of the line. Travel time is 1 to 1 1\2 hrs. Go early as the lines start early and are long, Be prepared for a long wait. Entrance fee is fairly steep. Once you get to the head of the line you will board a tram and ride thru the open animal enclosures. No flash photos requested on the 30 minute tour. You can also walk the entire path of the tram or do both. There are food stands, souvenir shops and some other entertainment. If not for the crowds and lines it would be an enjoyable visit.

The tram ride is very informative as you to get to know lot of details about the wild animals, but the walking trails are the best part as you get to see lot of wild animals up close without much fencing or barrier. With very minimal security staff, it is an adventure which you do not want to miss at all. We heard a loud roaring sound during one of our walking trail and when asked the nearest security staff, he casually replied ""that's the lion roaring"". It sent a shiver down the spine for a couple walking with us.

We then went back to the entrance to catch a tram, by which time the queues had reduced dramatically. The night safari is a great idea. Unfortunately we found that most people who attended treated it as a theme park ride. They were shouting, whooping, talking over the guides, taking flash photos and generally behaving in a manner which was disrespectful of the animals. The guides repeatedly asked them not to use flash, to sit down etc but were ignored. I made a shhhhhhhhh noise several times when it got really bad and thus worked, also encouraged others to do likewise.

Very disappointed that most animals were either “hiding” somewhere or went to sleep somewhere. Even the ones we can see just showed their vague/fuzzy figures or shadows at most. The train driver moved so fast that we had no chance to have a decent glance at those fuzzy things.
The night tour arranged by the Hotel was not satisfactory in any possible way.
We left the Hotel on 6PM sharp, went to Chinatown to pick up other guests from different hotels. When we’re finally on the way to the Zoo, it’s 7PM already: a whole hour later. It took 40-45 min to get to the Zoo. Around 745PM, we were on “tour” train and see almost nothing. The “tribe show” was interesting.

We had bought tickets online and arrived early for our 7.15 slot. Given no instructions about which queue to join, we wasted 15 mins in the wrong queue. Then waited a further 40 minutes in a queue of maybe 400 people before we boarded. I should have bailed out then!
THE TRAIN TRIP
Commentary was cheesy. The tram stopped when the guide could see the animal (she was up the front). We got her spiel, then we moved on. Those in the back half of the train saw the animal from the moving vehicle as we sped off.
Because we had queued so long, it was quite dark by the time we got on the train- photography was out of the question. The animals were at quite a distance usually, and we had only brief glimpses.
STOPS
There was only ONE chance to get off and see anything on foot, and we were restricted to one very short walking trail before we had to reboard the train. YOU ARE NOT FREE TO WALK AROUND INDEPENDENTLY.
THE ROUTE
The train only covers a limited part of the zoo at best, and we had brief glimpses of maybe 10 species of animals in the dark.

The Night Safari at the Zoo sounded a bit different but perhaps I hadn't researched carefully enough what it was and was expecting something more like a safari and less like a ride around a zoo at night.
We tried to join a tour from the centre of Singapore but had left it too late for a place on the tour coach that night so decided to go by public transport using our ez-link cards. We paid for our Safari tickets on-line with a discount and got the emailed tickets. The journey was all very straight forward, take the MRT to Ang Mo Kio, walk across the road to the bus interchange and take the 138 to the Zoo. It terminates there so no problem knowing when to get off or catch the bus for the trip back. It took about an hour and like all public transport was good value.
The emailed tickets worked at the entry barriers. We paid for the 8.30pm admission but were allowed in at 8.15, there was a short queue. The safari is taken on road trains along a road past animal enclosures. A disappointing bit was that the commentary was pre-recorded and triggered so often did not coincide with what you could, or more often, couldn't see.
As well as the road train they have footpaths past the animals which were much more enjoyable as you had time to read the information displays and take time to spot the animals which were closer.
We rushed our last part of the walking bit to get back in time for the last show, I wished we hadn't as it was very child entertainment orientated with fairly superficial knowledge all of which I had heard on the safari and read in much more depth on the information boards.
So in summary a pleasant zoo experience, I would vote for spending more time on the walks.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:33:08.809018

Visited during Tet holiday, maybe this is why the lines for ticket purchase were very long.

The attraction consists of a half-hour train ride round a zoo in the dark with lit exhibits of animals from around the world, not particularly SE Asian. The animals are presented very well, with an illusion of no barriers between the animals and the visitors. It is also possible to walk around the exhibits taking about an hour, but few visitors do this.

There are also a couple of short staged shows run at regular intervals and a good range of food outlets.

Many tourists were talking and making a lot of noise which I didn't care for. Some also wouldn't listen to the non-flash photography rule. It was okay but I think children would enjoy it more.

I would say the same goes for the show. The show host will greet everyone after being seated and begin the show. Trainers will come out with animals and walk through the seating area.

We did the wallaby and bat walk through but too scared to do the flying squirral one.
Sadly there is two main buses which go to the zoo which are quite infrequent and stop at 12ish which isn't suitable as the zoo closes at midnight.

I went to this attraction about 10 years ago and while I am happy I returned it wasnt as good an experience for me as I had remembered.  I think it was mostly due to the crowds.  Lots of people talking VERY LOUDLY.  By skipping the tram and walking the trails I thought (like last time) i could avoud this.  Nope. 
All the loud talking takes away from the night experience.  As well, there are all these high power and LOUD fans installed at many of the viewing areas which really ruins the atmosphere as well.  There are of course lots of things to see, various cats, hyenas, and many smaller nocturnal creatures which may take a moment or two to notice but with some patience you find them.  The walking paths are well done, not lit up too much.
So, my opinion is that when purchased as a combined ticket with the day time zoo it is worth the cash and time.  Go as late as you can as the crowds were really thinning around 11.  There is lots to see, but maybe bring earplugs.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 15:33:26.958059

We then boarded our bus and had a wonderful guide with us explaining things along the way and making jokes.

We had 50 minutes for the buffet dinner. There were enough options for a vegetarian which was good.

We got to skip the long lines and boarded the tram with our group for the safari. It was nice seeing the animals in a different light. Also much better than walking around the zoo in the heat during the day so a great alternative. It was nice to see animals without cages.

After the Safari we lined up and saw a show which was pretty entertaining. Then we regrouped and went back to our coach for the ride back to our hotels. There was no time to really buy any souvenirs which is probably a good thing.

We were coming from Santosa Island - and it's quite a trek. We started thinking we could make it in an hour and a half using the public transport directions... while we would have eventually got there, during peak hour we would have needed more than the time we had so we hopped in a cab and traveled the rest of the way.

We had a 7:15 time slot for entry but didn't arrive till 7:25pm. Counters 3 & 4 were taking e-vouchers, this line took 25 minutes, to get our tickets. I was a little disappointed, thinking that we'd need to wait till 8:15pm, but we were waved straight through.

We opted for the tram ride first, the line was long, but moved quickly. I think it was about a 20 minute wait. Our tram was packed full and even though the staff asked people to keep noise to a minimum - our trip was filled with excited squeals. When walking around the park later, the trams were virtually empty, the trip looked a lot more serene (and the later tram trip would have allowed us to sea more shows). Regardless of how full the tran was, the trip was great. We only had 2 ""no shows"" (animals), we saw loads of animals and quite close, some were even on road, changing paddocks. There was a insightful recorded narration with information about the animals and their relation to Singapore. There is NO flash photography permitted but photos and video was allowed.

After our tram ride, we queued for the ""Creatures of the Night"" show, we queued for around 30 minutes to ensure ourselves a seat, it allowed us to get a great seat. I can't speak highly enough of this show, the presenter made my night, he was engaging, humorous and educational. The staff stayed calm even when everything didn't go to plan - they were just amazing. After the show there was opportunity for photos with a few of the animal stars - so stick around right to the end.

Because of the timing of our tram ride and the Creatures of the Night show - we didn't get to see any others.

After the show let out we walked all the walking trails, had plenty of extra photo ops and were able to watch the Hyenas playing after their feeding - it was priceless.

We exited the park at 11:40pm, the park closed at 12 midnight. The one complication with that is the bus service that would get us back to our accommodation had stopped, so we needed to catch a cab back.

The park itself was immaculate, the staff were amazing and the animals were fantastic.

If I had to give any advice it would be leave plenty of time if traveling via public transport. Have a ""plan b"" if you linger in the park and your service has terminated... and don't feel the need to rush to the tram - take in the shows, walk the trails and take the tram later in night for a quieter more relaxing trip.

Had lunch in the bistro area of Ah Meng, which was easy to purchase (had Mee Siam & parter had Laksa) & reasonably priced. Can be difficult to find a table when busy, but keep looking, tables are quick to free up. Overall a positive & enjoyable experience with the only negative being, the queuing system for taxis. Seems to be rather disorganised & took much longer than expected given that there are many taxis queued on site.

We headed straight for the trams (only because we were fearful we might not get one later, due to the 10pm entries but we needn't have worried). This was the first sight we had had of the ""no cage"" zoo, it was incredible! The deer are standing right next to you, and the lions are just on a hill over a tiny stream. Being in the dark, just made it more of an adventure.

After this we went to walk up the trails, which were also brilliant. As many people seemed to just do the trams and go home, a lot of the time it felt like it was just my husband and I in the whole zoo!

My only regret is that we didn't have time to visit the zoo during the daytime as well, because you see different animals. However, Singapore is very hot (tropical climate -- hot and muggy with occasional rain), so if you go during day, go early in AM, or it will be too hot.

There are no cages. All animals are in their natural environment. The zoo is huge, so it's great they have a tram to take your around, but there is also a place to hop off/hop on, where you can actually walk for a while to see the animals.

I would recommend the bus tour there, because you get preferred treatment when waiting for the trams that take you around the zoo, and because we were there at Christmas time, it was very crowded.

I would also recommend the International buffet. The food was varied and tasty. We were also able to see an animal show at night, but I didn't think that part was great (but it was included in the price).

The safari consists of four walking trails and one tram ride. They are all mostly separate - what you see from the tram ride, you won't be able to see from the trails.

Tips:

1. There is a fire show before you enter the venue, but given the huge crowds, you probably won't be able to see it. If you've seen a Polynesian fire show in Hawaii, it's pretty much the same.

2. Arrive 30-45 minutes before your admission showtime, to get a front seat at the ""Creatures of the Night"" show. The show is aimed at kids, and good but not amazing. We saw bear cats, otters, owls, a serval cat, and a huge snake.

3. Take the walking trails first, THEN do the tram ride at the end, when it's far less crowded, and you'll be tired from walking.

Despite the large number of visitors in the park, we did not feel crowded at all during the zoo walk and by the time we returned back to the starting point, the trams were virtually empty so our tram ride was also very pleasant. It was a wonderful experience to be up close to the animals. It was nice to see the animals living in habitats that afforded them sufficient space and comfort. We were disappointed that the shuttle bus to and from the downtown area stopped at 10.30pm and so we were left to take an Uber back to our hotel - this trip, however, was really quite cheap (only $16 if I recall correctly).

The crowds were overwhelming on a hot night I don't know how some families with small kids were handling the chaos. We saw some animals however poor lighting and pushy tourists meant we gave up and tried to head to the 9.30 night show which was so packed we had to sit towards the edges of the theatre and half of the show we couldn't see which was really disappointing and frustrating - clearly they would know certain seats could not see the stage.
Queues for the tram were over an hour long (we gave it a miss) and we waited just over 40 minutes for the night show and still had bad seats.

Overall while you can see nocturnal animals overall we didn't rate the experience and would really suggest people with small families weigh up the experience with being prepared for long lines in peak evenings.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/rkyprian,447315499,29-12-2016,1,Seriously underwhelming,"Booked this with Buffalo Tours. Billed as a 5 and half hour tour. Indeed we were picked up at 6pm and dropped back at hotel just after 11pm. Of those 5 hours we spent 40 minutes on a tram and 20 minutes in a night 'show'. The rest of the time was spent getting there and getting back and queuing. Buffalo tours clearly couldn't cope efficiently with the number of people it was taking so we ended up arriving late for the timetable their guide had told us we would take (20 min show, 40 min tram ride rest of the time exploring by ourselves). When we did arrive it was a zoo (!) - packed with people and long queues, which we were told we would miss by booking a tour company. So, pIcked up at hotel at 6pm, arrived at Night Safari at 7.35, queued for 30 minutes to get on the 'VIP no queue' tram, arriving back at 8.45 when we queued 45 minutes to get into the 'unmissable' 20 minute Creatures of the Night show, then spent 20 minutes fighting our way out and finding our bus for the return trip.
As for the events - not sure what I expected from a night safari, but our tram took as round the park where we saw in the dim light docile animals, many hidden away or standing around or just trying to sleep. There were a couple of sleepy lions, a sleeping giraffe, a rhino, and a tiger, otherwise it was many types of deer, pigs and cattle. Quite frankly a walk around your local zoo would get you to see more, get you closer, offer better visibility and see more activity in the animals. Thinking about it afterwards - why a night safari when you can't see and the animals are docile? I tried but zero photos.
As for the unmissable Creatures of the Night show, this involved 2 raccoons, 2 owls hand held, 1 otter and a small bear like creature that could sniff out a grape. Oh, and a 30 foot Python that was so bored it had to be carried in and out by 2 handlers, and otherwise looked like it wished it was anywhere else.
If you have children under 8 years of age, they might get a kick out of this. The families I saw there were stressed out by the queuing and the sheer numbers of people. This is a terrible waste of a whole evening in beautiful Singapore.",12-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:34:11.610748

This let you pick your time, we were not sure what time we would arrive so booked for 8:15, but arrive early 7:00, so needed to wait around until 8pm, there are shops and a bar, but these were expensive, a bottle of beer was $13.50. They would not let us enter early or change the time on the tickets.

You could just turn up and pay, but you run the risk of all the tickets being sold out.

I advise you book the earlier ticket of 7:15, and you can still enter until 8:00, giving you a 45min window. The queue for the first entry was manic, and they waited until 7:15 before opening the gates.

The rides and the shows were not very well synchronised, this may depend on when you entered, on entry you had option to wait for 30mins for the live show or queue to get on the train ride.

We went for the train, having waited around to get in, when the train got back the show had started and the next show was already full, which meant a 90 min wait.

The train was good, but very busy, and when people were trying to take photos with phones, which most people do, it does cause you to lose your night vision, making it difficult to see in the darker area.

Some of the animals were roaming free and the train passes within touching distance, although these were farm type animals, rather than wild.

I recommend walking, you got closer to the animals, especially the Tiger, who was sleeping against the glass of the enclosure.

You could not get to see the elephant on foot.

Going a night was more atmospheric, a lot of the animals being nocturnal were being fed, and it was cooler walking around.

Look out for offers on line, the day after we visited the priced dropped 25%, from$45 to $33.

The walks around the zoo take about 20mins for each zone, there are a few steps but some steep inclines. There good is Wheel chair access.",12-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:34:21.744395

We then learned, just before the bus picked us up, that this is infact a zoo. We nervously laughed for about ten minutes and wondered what the hell we'd booked on to.
The bus picks you up from your hotel and then drops you in the gardens by the bay, where you pay for your tickets if you haven't already done so or just collect a sticker and wait for the main bus to take you there.
A guide comes with you and tells you what will happen and what you'll see when you get there.
You are given a fast track sticker which allows you to get on the first available tram. Thd trams are open sided and approx 4-5 carriages long. There is a recording thats plays as you go around and although we were really apprehensive, it was actually very good! We saw every single animal on the list! And only the Tiger was behind a window. Everything else was in an open enclosure (does that even make sense). All of the animal's are separated from each other but able to roam around in their own areas.
Once the tram stops, you can get off and walk around the park. This is where you will see some things that are in enclosures, like smaller wild cats etc.
When you get back to the main entrance their are tons of food places and I think they do shows but wd missed those.
The bus then takes you straight back to your hotel.

Zoo's aren't normally my thing, possibly because I've been brought up visiting zoo's with caged animals or animals behind bars, but this zoo is different, at time it feels like you can actually touch the animals and in fact walk among them.

We had dinner to start the trip at the Ulu Ulu buffet restaurant, fantastic food, lots of variety & good quality.
We took the tram ride first of all, and it did not disappoint, I was concerned that we wouldn't see many animals, but we saw every single type. The animals were so close to the tram route that we had fantastic views of them and the habitats they were in were very realistic and large, so did not give it the feel of a 'zoo'. I've seen reviews where people are complaining about not being able to use the flash on their cameras - this is common sense so that the animals aren't startled/blinded and you should immerse yourself in the experience rather than trying to photograph everything. The commentary as you pass by the animals is very interesting. If you are visiting the park not through a tour company, the queues for the tram during busy times can span for hours - with the pre-booked tours with Tour East you can skip the queues and board a tram immediately.
The walking trails were also enjoyable, again we saw lots of the animals as we walked through. The only downside of the pre-arranged tour is we didn't have enough time to do both walking trails.
The creatures of the night show was brilliant, very informative with enthusiastic staff, interesting nocturnal animals and audience interaction.
All in all I would 100% recommend the Night Safari for adults and children alike. The downside to the booked tour is that you don't have extra time to just wander around as timings are quite strict, however the Night safari is difficult to access by public transport and taxi's are likely expensive.

The night safari was substandard, as there are a much larger range of attractions and animals to see during the day.

With huge lines and long wait times of over an hour for a tram ride with a few stops, was disappointing.

Even with the poor lighting, many of the animals were not even there and the ones that were, meant they were barely visible.

So much for the wild animal encounters as advertised.

Afterwards, the included 20 minute, creatures of the night performance, showcased a few animals briefly, but also has limited seating and is based on a first come, first serve basis.

The safari ride for me was sadly disappointing. The darkness and poor lighting meant that a lot of animal details in the safari talk were not visible and in some cases the animals themselves were just moving bulges in the dark. Closer inspection of most of these enclosures in what lighting was available revealed poor enclosure design and the large male bull elephant on the ride was repetitively rocking back and forth which was extremely concerning as Ive never seen this at ANY other park.

Alot of the enclosures along the walking paths were not well lit and quite simply If you inspect them closely they are extremely average which is masked by the darkness.

The shear variety of hoof stock species here was impressive and the some of the species kept here were awesome ( Malayan tiger, Sloth bear, Asiatic lion) But again what is the point if you cant really even see them !!!

The lines here were long for everything and the crowd seemed more interested in partying then enjoying the animals.

Night Safari should be enjoyed with no camera's. The stubborn tourist who still keeping using flash for taking photos are countless reminders should be banned from being allowed on the tram ride.

The Night Safari is one of the best (if not, the best) attraction in Singapore and is certainly one of a kind.

Located in the North of Singapore you can take a taxi there or a bus. If driving parking is really easy.

If you read some of the reviews, there was points deducted for poor food or crowds. Well it is the zoo, don't go there for food unless you really have very little time. And being the best attraction in Singapore and one of the very few things you can do at night of course it would be crowded.

How to Enjoy The Park

For me there is only one way to go about enjoying the night safari which is to go right when the park opens, and once you enter, avoid the tram queue and avoid the show. Go straight to the walking trail. This would allow you to enjoy the environment, be relatively away from the noise and get to see the animals up close without the pressure of being pushed forward. The trail would take u an hour or more and you should take your time. This will bring you to a sort of pit stop with a tram stop. Do not take the tram here. Do go to the tram stop and walk on as it has a small path beyond it to bring you to the giraffes. Many people don't notice that. The other thing to note at the pit stop is to find the lion look out.

Continue walking from the pit stop on the next trail and you will see lots of stuff. Eventually you will return to the main entrance. It is one big loop and its a good 1-2 hrs walk. Take your time enjoy it. Now at the main entrance you can go to see the show. The idea is to take the tram ride as late as possible. That is where the queues are the shortest and sometimes u get to choose where to sit on the tram.

I usually leave at closing time. But I have time for everything and if really want, i can go on the tram more than once.

So walk the trail, see the show, take the tram.

The night safari is a place where you can escape from the city and to enjoy time with animals and the environment. You can bring your own food and drink if you must. Naturally like all attractions, try to go on a week day.",05-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:35:07.384659

If you're not comfortable with the dark this is not for you as you're on a open tram going through windy paths in almost pitch black rainforest and can be unnerving. There is only one stop about 5 mins into the ride that you can get off at and there are no other areas one can disembark if they wanted to, not sure if this is ideal for people with smaller children who may get scared.

The animals are dimly lit so you could hardly see them or make out what they were. Majority of these creatures aren't nocturnal so they were sleeping anyway. The ones we saw looked very sad and like they were in super small enclosures that were way too close to the tram, I'm not sure how happy or comfortable the animals would have been. It's more like a Zoo that you can drive around and the animals are uncomfortably close up. There's no point in bringing a camera as no flash photography is allowed, which is fair enough as it would startle and can potentially blind animals. But this means people can't take pictures of the animals and there are non available for sale either.

The Night show was entertaining but again a bit fake. A lot of turning lights off and on which could upset little ones.

The only time they get active is when they are fed at the night (you can watch some animals being fed at certain specific times).

Oh dear, at times it felt like Disney with the roped off lines and the canned commentary.

Basically, the animals were ""shown off"" to the best advantage with long narrow enclosures with clever lighting and moats, so it felt like they were close enough to almost reach out and touch them. It appears they are fed at night to keep them active, and who doesn't love seeing baby animals with their mums?

On your left you will see the Wambesi man eating killer donkey ... nope ... out of all the animals referred to on the ride, you were lucky to see half of them.

Give the train a miss and walk the trails starting with the Leopard Trail, that way you get to see the animals, some of them right up close (hope you aren't scared of bats).

There are places where there are glass walls that let you put your face a couple of inches from a leopard ... you can see him/her but she/he can't see you because of the well planned lighting.

Honestly, that was the least of my issues. Yes, it was pricey for what was offered. However, my main concern were the animals! Most of their enclosures are not big enough for them and they lack stimulation. They all looked bored and unhappy. The most striking example of that was the serval (wild african cat) - It was constantly pacing up and down along the edge of it's enclosure for ages without stopping! I felt stressed watching it. And if you are an animal lover and know enough about them, you will know that this a sign of distress and a lack of stimuli. Meaning it's enclosure is way too small for the animal, and/or it is unhappy in it's environment. This really broke my heart, and it's such a shame to see animals like this in captivity. They are supposed to be well taken care of. If anything, provide them with a better and more spacious environment, as well as more stimulating activities. Animals are not just for show. You are a zoo. Know how to treat them. Even all the elephants were rocking their heads from side to side, which is not normal at all. It is caused by boredom, frustration and desolation.

While all the other zoos have the animals enclosed in cages, you can hardly find cages in Singapore Zoo.
Even though this zoo occupies a huge space, efforts have been put by the management for its excellent maintenance & hygiene facts.

People of all ages will enjoy this beautiful place as its well equipped will all the amenities required for people of different age groups.

They have a Tram service which will drop you to different spots. Once you have the tram tickets you can have unlimited trips.

The most amazing feature and highlight of the Singapore Zoo is the Night Safari! With animals as close as within 100 metres without any barricades or cages, is just a mind blowing experience!

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/844timn,417468973,12-09-2016,2,"A repeat of the Zoo at night, with longer wait times, bland show, and less animals","I was there on 11/09/2016. I purchased the Night Safari as a package with the 3 other parks (Zoo, Bird Park, River Safari).

Problems:
1) The biggest problem with the Night Safari is that many of the animals (80%+) are repeated from the Zoo. The same facts and display boards are repeated again here. You don't learn too many new things.

2) The animals are hard to spot in the exhibit and I think there are better technological ways of showcasing the animals (infrared, multiple camera angles, more red lighting). What's the point if you can't even tell if the animal is there? A lot of animals didn't seem to be there.

3) Wait times. Long lines to get in. Long lines for the tram. Long lines for the show. I spent about 1.25 hours out of 3.5 hrs waiting in lines. Ouch.

4) Inclement weather procedures. It started raining pretty hard which caused the 9:30 show to be cancelled. For a place that only has one show, it's very disappointing there isn't a way to avoid rain cancellations in a tropical country. An overhead cover like the Zoo or Bird Park perhaps? I think blaming cancellation on rain is just a lack of motivation to get a solution and provide a good experience.

Then the 10:30 show was delayed by 15 minutes even though the rain had completely stopped at 9:40. Still they said the inclement weather had their hands tied. Was this the first time it had ever rained in Singapore? I know it doesn't sound like much, but considering that the shows are occasionally full (8:30 was full) and that you have to come early by 15-10 minutes to get a spot in line, it adds up. The park is open for half a long as a normal park (4.5 hours vs. 9).

When there was lightning, workers were sent to warn people off the trails and back to the main area. This lightning was quite far away, minimal, and scattered (15 minutes). However, the workers were pushy if you were on the trail. They didn't give you an option to stay, unless you insisted you wanted to keep on the trail. As a result, the majority of guests on the trail were unnecessarily turned back (I stuck around when I saw other guests still on the trail). Also, the park is full of tall metallic light posts and trees, so I think the fear of a lightning strike on a person is very very overblown; it is certainly no flat golf course.

5) The Show. There is only one show ""Creatures of the Night"". It repeats elements of other shows from the Zoo and Bird Park (yes the snake skin is dry, yes owls can turn their head 270 degrees). Let's invite someone who is scared of snakes to hold the giant python (yaaawwwwn). Let's see how the otter can teach us to recycle (ZzzzzZzzz). The kids seemed into it. But it felt forced (are you guys excited? yessss. I can't hear you... YESSSSS, get on with it already!!!!). Mostly animals appear on stage for 30 seconds and then walk off stage. The asian bear cat was the most interesting animal, because it can jump quite high 2-3 meters.

The Good
1) Night time walking trails. Spooky feeling. Lots of trees. Fun. The Malayan Flying Fox walkthrough was interesting because you could get close. Same with the wallabies.

Overall: Do the Zoo and Bird Park. They are way better. Spend your time at the Gardens by the Bay or Universal Studios. This was too much hassle with too little reward.",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:36:08.930015

- The "" Creatures of the Night Show"" show was bad. First 10mins was spent telling people to turn off there flash on there cameras, and obviously some people promptly did the exact opposite. Lots of shouting over microphones.Which kind of ruins the atmosphere of the night safari. The loudness was very OTT. Something a bit more in keeping with the idea of the night and the nature of nocturnal animals would have been better.

Positive things

+ Lots and lots of animals to see, almost too much in one night.
+ Jump on a small train, travel to a close by area which then has a walking route that you can do to see different nocternal animals.
+ Highlights for me include the fruit bat enclosure. Which literally has bats flying around you.
+ Super atmospheric, glad we went.

You will see some amazing animals during the tour which are all fairly active being that they are mostly nocturnal. The showstopper is their male elephant, which blew my mind the first time I saw it.

You spend time on a vehicle which drives through the habitats, and you also have several opportunities to get off the tram and walk the trails which house a host of different creatures you could easily miss if you didn't bother. You could spend hours alternating between the two and it is certainly worth taking the time.

Do no fall into the trap of ""we've seen the zoo during the day, how much more could there be?"" Because the variety and experience of the night zoo is worth every penny.

I have done both the tour and solo and in my opinion it is worth making a night of it with the tour group. You will get a nice buffet meal at one of the restaurants, priority access to the vehicle, and a guide who (for us) was fantastic and very knowledgeable in regards to the animals.

Do not leave Singapore without visiting the night safari.

There is a tour on a shuttle with the best Chinese-English descriptive language I have witnessed and worth the payment alone! you can then hop off and walk the around the zoo to see the animals (some behind a glass wall of course) in their habitat.

The driver actually drove by the some of the animals and we had to ask him to stop so we could actually see them.

It was really different to see the animals roaming around at night, and I'd recommend that you don't do the tram for the first 2 stops, as it's nicer (and a lot quieter to walk around).

But ISANGO, Funvee and SAEX suck. I booked for our party of four tickets to the Hop on Hop off + Night Safari through a website called Local Singapore Tours powered by ISANGO. The bus company they hired is called SAEX.

The bus picked us up at 6:10 pm and brought us to the ticket center where we had to wait for ten minutes before being picked up by another bus that went on to pick up other passengers. It was a long and annoying process and we got to the Night Safari well past 8pm. Along with the other passengers, we were a group of 7 (four of us, plus a group of 2, plus a solo traveller). The earliest available tram was 9:15. We were told that we could take the bus at three times, the latest being 11:00 pm.

We were at the bus stop at exactly 2 minutes before 11:00 pm, only to see the SAEX bus leave us, despite our frantic waving of arms and our entreaties for him to stay. We were then told by the men in the SAEX counter that it was the last bus, and there was no more coming. We told him that we were not late, we arrived exactly on time, and as paying customers, SAEX thus had a legal and contractual obligation to bring us to our destination. He said that there was no bus coming, and we had to pay 10 singapore dollars per head to take a van (which magically arrived, ready to drive us home for 10 dollars each, or 70 dollars total.). We are certain that he is also a SAEX employee because he was right inside the SAEX booth. I am not sure if the company and its partners know of what their employees are doing, but it ruined our trip and left a bad taste in our mouth.

Do avoid these companies: ISANGO, Funvee, SAEX.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:36:28.898384

Our tour status ensured we had priority access which reduced the wait for a free car from 90 to 30 minutes!
The tour is done using an electric land train on a Tarmac lane that winds through the park. There are two or three carriages to each train with an amplified live commentary starting with a safety lecture and a plea not to use flash or infra red focusing on phones or cameras
The success of your trip is entirely dependent upon on how well the animals can hide and for the most part they were most obliging especially the tapir, rhino and Malay tiger all much larger than expected
The meal, included in our tour, is conducted as a buffet in a large covered space with wooden tables and benches arranged around a series of buffet islands catering for many different cuisines. We were placed in the oriental area which meant a long walk and queue for those in our party seeking western foods
It is possible to walk through the park crisis-crossing the land train lane (supervised by park officials) though I am not sure how close this brings you to the animals
There is also a Disney like ""Show"" that presents some of the animals;otters, owls, a python etc and ironically calls for better ecological protection of the animals. After this there is a rush for taxis and tour buses, although if you were not on a tour you could walk through the park until closing time at two am, which we might do next time",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:36:30.347560

There are big lines for the open carts as soon as you enter so we did 2 walking paths first and then went on the carts after when the lines were gone.
We decided to see the live show, line up early as the lines get really big. Its worth seeing the show
We then went back and did the walking paths we missed earlier.
This was a fantastic experience and most of the animals were moving around and eating.

As soon as we got there it was just queues! You get given a time, ours was 9.15. You'd think that meant you'd enter the zoo a5 this time, but no! We didn't actually enter the zoo till 10.15, then we got told we could do the 4 walking tours before getting in the tram, but the zoo closes at 12, and the team ride takes 40 mins. So we continued to queue for another 40 mins. The tram ride was OK, but you didn't really get your see much, and animals didn't seem natural to me. We eventually go out at 11.15. By this stage we both had headaches and felt truly ripped off, so went home.
But the queues again were mad crazy to get public transport or taxis. I thought I might cry. Luckily I'd downloaded an app called grab, and I managed to get us a taxi while hundreds of others continued to queue!
I honestly felt like this was a rip off. We spent more time queuing than enjoying the attraction. It's almost like they just want another opportunity to make money off the tourists. 1 park split into 4, so if you want to see all the animals you have to pay loads.

The advertised public transport on their website from woodlands is not possible after 6pm yet the night safari doesn't open until 7.30pm. This was a surprise for us and meant an expensive taxi which was unplanned. There are other busses but knowing which one is still operating is not clear.

We booked in advance which was best as the first two admissions were sold out on arrival leaving only 9.30pm. Despite booking we still had an hour wait for the tram. In hindsight we probably should have walked first and returned to the tram afterwards.

The concept of exploring the zoo at night when the nocturnal animals are most active is unique but more logical - we saw the animals being far more natural (and interesting) at their peak times. This did begin to tire out by 9.30/10 though as even they began to settle down for the night. The walk through the bat enclosure and other enclosures puts you right up close with the wild animals and really improves the experience.

To end the evening an enjoyable show was given for some of the smaller nocturnal animals which was an enjoyable 45 minutes. The food options promptly close though leaving little choice for dinner if you choose to frequent these expensive eateries.

How wrong were these reviews?! I am so glad I disregarded them and went over to check it out myself. This place is great! First of all, it has 4 intake times - 7.15pm, 8.15pm, 9.15pm and 10.15pm – be aware and plan your visit accordingly, as it closes at midnight. We went for the 9.15pm onwards slot and we didn’t have enough time to finish exploring the whole place..really regret that :( We were literally chased out at midnight because we were hanging around doing the walking trails without checking our watches haha!

I would call the Night Safari a slow paced unique adventure. Guests will get a chance to witness a fire-breathing Thumbuakar Performance at the entrance, which is very interesting! Once you enter the premises, I suggest you start off with the Creatures of the Night Show which is really organized and informative. You can then tour the place on a tram, discovering the wildlife of 7 geographical regions. Once you’re done with that, you can further explore the premises on foot, exploring the four interlinked walking trails. My suggestion is go there early and have the entire evening to explore the place at your leisure.

I must say that we were thoroughly impressed by how organized the whole concept was. Even though the crowd was large, you hardly felt it as everything was organized very smoothly! Well done, Night Safari Team! It was truly a great evening :) ",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:36:46.976141

Once the safari began we quickly realized it was almost impossible to take pictures while on the tram at night with our phones, so we just sat back and enjoyed the show.

Also, it is not recommended for toddlers and babies. The nights in Singapore can be hot and humid, the kids turn up to be impatient and noisy. (Be considerate to fellow tourists.) Riding the tram with children and parents making all sorts of noise will definitely ruin the sight-seeing, as the animals tend to be startled. The kids will also have a very hard time spotting the animals. Better bring the children to Jurong Bird Park or the Singapore Zoo for a more educational view of the animals.

The lines to get on the trams were long so we did all the walking parts first, got to see animal being feed and speak to the keepers which was really good. We did the tram ride last which takes you too areas that are open with animals right next to the road and was a better way to end the night safari.

I must admit the buffet food was excellent.
We then went on a train to take us round the nocturnal animals.
This was really good but my wife was unable to see very well so was not really suited to this.I also had difficulty picking out the animals which clearly had their food strategically placed with a view to make them visible.
What we found particularly off-putting was the fact that on many occasions we were all told in no uncertain terms NOT to take any pictures with flashlights as this could damage the eyes of the nocturnal animals.Despite this people persisted in doing this,which was a real distraction,apart from the most important consideration that the animals might be harmed.This was not policed well and it should have been made clear that if there were further incidences the offenders would be asked to leave immediately.
We were not really impressed with the 'show' for which we had to queue for some time.
Perhaps I am being too critical but it was not really our 'cup of tea'.

Drove family who had purchased combo tickets at the Jurong Bird Park only to find that they now have to select an arrival time several days before going to this attraction. Who on holidays wants to be strictly regimented. And maybe if the time meant smooth travel through the attraction it could be forgiven but it doesn't.

The ticket had been put through wrong for a same day ticket even though it read to be used several days later on the Monday at 8.15. They also were told at Jurong Bird Park that this time was flexible but it wasn' so they had to wait and line up with throngs of other frustrated people just to get in the door, stifling traffic flow and causing copious bottle necks. I would hate to see this on a weekend which we didn't do trying to avoid this scenario.

Next the lines of people were outrageous and the mood was chaotic and embarrassing, since we'd said how good it was. WAS is the word here.

Food here used to be good and fairly reasonably priced, now it is a total tourist 'rip off'. Hawker meals that usually are $5 to $7 were $22. A crappy burger with cold fries were $18, add a drink and you see it at nearly $30 a head. I used to get satay here for about $12! Now no satay and no decent food, even the hawker rip off was really bad quality. And seating was a nightmare. Now you expect a 100% mark up on food for a tourist attraction that's just a given, but a 400% is highway robbery.

I am told that lines of people continued once they messed around with sorting out their tickets and got in the door as it was obvious that they had over sold the 7.15 crowd. Lines, lines and lines. Really a very bad ending to a good trip to Singapore and having witnessed the crowd at entering I totally believe it. I was intending to go and join them but there was no way given what I saw we would go.

Whoever now runs this is not doing anyone a favour by cramming everyone in and overselling and not focusing on a quality product, which it used to be. Very poor execution. Yes, I am quite annoyed at the waste of precious time that was wasted here.

As you enter there is a queue for the tram to take you around the park, however, you are presented with the option to take the walking trails. In my experience, I would suggest taking the walking trails first and thereafter returning to the tram when it's a bit quieter - ultimately saving you some time later in the evening.

The animals truly do come to life at night, we saw the lions running around and playing with each other. The tiger was right up and the spectator's window staring down everyone and the elephants were roaming around and giving us quite the show!

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/saltycroc,396188056,24-07-2016,1,Nightmare Safari,"Greetings Readers, Salty and Mrs Kroc are here in Singapore for a winter break from shaking down Australian Bogans for the bank to take in the spectacular flowers at the Garden Festival. We thought that we would also pay a visit to the night safari having been to the Singapore Zoo previously during the day and really enjoyed ourselves. This outstanding institution is at the vanguard of animal conservation, and particularly of the many endangered primates in this part of the world.

However, I can only describe our interaction with the night safari as an unmitigated disaster and an almost complete waste of $100. Things began well enough, we booked an online tour with City Tours figuring this would be the easiest way to get out to the zoo from where we are staying on Orchard Road. This was simple enough, and we had a good start with the shuttle van collecting us promptly at 5:45pm. We spent the next 40 minutes weaving our way through various neighbourhoods, stopping and waiting for patrons who never bothered to turn up. Eventually, we got down to the Singapore Flyer at 6:20pm. This seems like a long ride,but then we waited another 15 minutes for a shuttle driver to arrive and collect the 8 of us who had bothered to turn up.

Here began yet a stranger odyssey as, despite having a full van, we weaved our way through downtown streets stopping at two more hotels, where our second driver disembarked and engaged in animated discussions with staff at these hotels after which he returned to the car and eventually got us on the PIE to Lake Mandai. I have no idea way we made these stops,though it cost us another 20 minutes in delays, and I found it most amusing the fellow who was accosted at the last hotel seemed to be the doorman who was dressed in such an outrageous tuxedo and bow tie that I thought he was an extra from a Jackie Chan movie. It takes a debt collector to know a debt collector and my suspicion is that if some bills aren't paid soon, then someone is going to have a very bad day indeed!

Back to tho zoo. We eventually got there at 7:40, two hours after leaving the hotel. Here we waited another 40 minutes with other irate customers in line 4 of the ticketing window to redeem our on-line ticket, which wasn't really a ticket but a voucher for a ticket that could only be redeemed for an available show ticket. So despite having ""tickets"" for the 7:30 tour we wound up with tickets to the 9:15 admission. The length of the queue to enter was astounding. You would have thought that it was an exodus from some war torn hell hole.

This left us both speechless as we needed to be back on the bus home by 9:45 for the reverse two hour trip. I noted that we were not alone in our frustration. So we had an ice cream, kissed our $100 good bye and considered it a donation to the poor inmates, and walked down to catch a cab, which had us back on Orchard road in twenty minutes. It was the worst experience that we have ever had here and the most uncharacteristic. We can't recommend the night safari or city tours to anyone. My next safari will by to watch Tarzan in the theatre. At least I might actually get in to the theatre.

However, it is at night and some animals are difficult to see or are timid obviously, although a tapir walked right past us!! They are animals though, it's always going to be random of how it is.

It's difficult to say what I made of it. You can see there nocturnal animals and they are great but pics are near impossible unless using a top of the line slr so sitting back and enjoying the ride is good. They take you around on these coach/buggie things and you can get off to walk bits if you want.

There is also a show where the trainers demonstrate some of the animals traits and skills in an informative way. This was very very good.

My advice;
It opens at 7:30 if I remember and is near the river safari it's well sign posted. Turn up early, we turned up at 7 and the queue was the length of the courtyard which is huge. The staff are great at getting a lot of people through but be prepared to wait a while if you're not willing to stand in line for so long.

Also the food is mega expensive at the zoo. Bring your own and drinks if you can.

On finishing the night safari we needed a taxi back. From doing this twice it is important if you don't want to queue for ages then sit at the back of the show so you're first out and then walk quick to the rank near the entrance. There will be a lot but there are also loads of people coming out at the same time too.

When we arrived the 7.15 admission time was fully booked so had to go for the 8.15 time. This meant we had to wait before we could go into the actual safari. Outside the safari are a couple of fast food areas and shops to browse through. They did also give us a free pass into the river safari as currently a lot of the sites were closed for renovation. It was still pretty good to see the manatees that they have there, but no boat ride unfortunately. As soon as 8.15 came you were let into the park and could either go by tram around the park or walk. As there was a big queue for the tram we decided to walk around. This was brilliant! Obviously it is very dark and spotting the animals is half the fun but walking around felt so much more of a natural experience. The Asian otters were particularly cute, being able to hear them before you could see them. The bat enclosure was also very good although not for the feint hearted. We walked halfway around, then jumped on the tram to experience the elephants, Rhinos and the other larger animals that aren't accessible by walking. We got back to the beginning and jumped on to see the first half again but on the tram. Then at halfway hopped off and walked the final bit which consisted of hyenas, Tigers and flying squirrels.
The tram took approximately 40 mins with the second half of the trip taking most of that chunk. If you wanted to walk only part of the safari, it would definitely have to be the first half. There are four trails, 2 for each half of the safari. It took us half an hour for each trail but could easily be done in 15 minutes. We finished everything at 11 but missed the show! My advice would be to buy a ticket beforehand for the 7.15 admission so you have a longer time going around all the animals.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:37:30.917546

Unfortunately, like most zoos, you walk around visiting the animals in their sectioned off cage or habitat. This experience was no different except it was night time and most animals were siting in one spot looking forward under what feels like a street lamp or spotlight, perched or propped for your enjoyment. Most of the animals on display aren’t even nocturnal animals, inactive and depressing. Some were moving but the whole experience seemed unnatural.

The Queue to take the trolley was unbearably long, especially in the heat and humidity. The cab ride to the zoo from Chinatown Singapore was 20Singapore dollars and it was 60$ Sinapore dollars to go back to our hotel by Taxi (we had to wait in queue for 20 mins).

All in all, not worth the 60USD for the Night Safari. Save yourself the hassle and go to the normal Singapore Zoo.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:37:31.264759

I did not go to the Night Safari because it was a little less convenient to go at night and I figured it would be nothing special since I've been to the other 3 unique zoos. Much to my surprise, this is such a good place to visit. In fact, it's probably my favorite of the 4 zoos. It's just such a unique visit in the zoo at nighttime and almost all of the animals were active. You have to sign up for a time to enter. Then they make you watch this show where a guy twirls fire sticks. I thought the show was awful so we got in early. We got on the trolley and it was a pleasant 35 minute ride. The animals are so close and some don't even have barriers if they are animals that pose no threat. After the trolley ride, there is a path to follow to see the animals you can't see on the trolley. That path takes about 1.5-2 hours to walk depending on your pace. You could do it faster too of course. There is just something exciting about seeing the animals active at night. I would highly recommend any local to do the Night Safari. And if I have visitors to Singapore, I'm probably going to have them visit the Night Safari instead of the Zoo.

I think the zoo is a better all round experience,We chose to do what is called the safari expedition tour i.e. Your ticket covers both the river safari and the night safari (not entrance to the zoo). One of the traps of doing it this way is that the river safari which you usually arrive at around 2:30pm takes only a couple of hours to complete. The tour guide doesn't go with you. They just hand over the tickets and give you the instructions. The night safari however doesn't open until 7pm which leaves you 2.5 - 3 hours with time to kill. Not an easy feat unless you pay the extra to enter the zoo area. There is a pre-opening fire show but unless you are standing at the ropes it's not the best view. The best view comes from the burger place next to the show platform but you need to have bought food or a drink to sit in the area. Our guide returned at 7:15 to take us inside for the night animal show. This was informative but a little disappointing and I don't know how many times the Rangers have to ask people to not use a flash because it effects the animals before they'll listen. We were obviously with a deaf crowd. At the end of the show we went on the train ride but in a seat of 4 you really are limited to only seeing the animals on one side. This took around 40 minutes after which time the guide told us we now had time for dinner as the bus would not be returning until 10pm. We had been in the humidity for nearly 9.5 hours with little reprieve from breeze or cooling stations. We would never do it this way again.

Our guide was a frazzled mess, she simply could not cope with keeping 17 people together.

We chose the optional meal with our tour. The food was awful, dried out, tasteless & not much to choose from. But worse was how rushed it was, the guide kept harassing us to finish but when we did we then had to wander about in hot, humid, crowded conditions waiting for the next stage.

We were then boarded onto 'trams' for our Safari, which wound it's way past various animals. Visibility was poor, & almost every animal was difficult or impossible to see.

We then waited for an hour for our bus back to the hotel.

While it was good for the express shuttle it was by far a waste of money as you only got 30 minutes free time and missed out on one of the shows. I would recommend doing your own thing and getting your own way there so you have plenty of time to see and enjoy everything! Or if you want to do the tour get your own way home. Note it is far out of the city so a cab can cost $60. or you can purchase a hop on hop off bus ticket and they do it as well. Or they have public transport (not sure what time that finishes though). just know IF YOU GO WITH THE VIATOR TOUR YOU WILL MISS A LOT OF THINGS! The dinner package was okay. The tram was excellent and great to see all the animals. The walking trails were fantastic although you do get lost if you don't pay attention. You can not use flash photography here but can take photos so be aware. The night safari is beside the river safari and the zoo. I would recommend spending the whole day and doing each one. Also if you chose to do it on a sunday you will find it hard to get a taxi/cab as they have their family day so they don't usually work out that way. So be prepared for a long wait or get a bus.

The animals are not caged and they are allowed to roam freely in restricted areas and there are tram rides with a guide's voice to narrate about the zoo. Go in the tram once and then explore the trails by foot too. There is a splendid lake view near the first stop of the tram. The view of the moon at this spot is tranquil and serene.

Missing was the giraffes, the wolves, the bears but there were plenty of deer varieties. And, surprisingly, there was no sign of the panda that features on the promotional posters around Singapore.

We purchased the 2 park hopper ticket (zoo and night safari) as it worked out as $59 each so it was a good deal. There is a 4 park ticket for $69 which includes the bird park and the river safari but we simply didn't have enough time. Our time for the night safari entrance was 7.15pm and we were queuing to enter well before 7pm. We queued for the tram and didn't see the show that was on and we still didn't get on the tram until close to 8pm. Some of the animals are hard to see, others are very easy! The bull elephants looked amazing! The tram ride takes around a half hour I believe then we completed the walking trails. They didn't take too long either and were a pleasant walk.
The reason why I didn't score it 5 out of 5 was due to the staggering amount of people that were there which dampens the experience a bit. What tends to happen is that large groups of people stand at attractions for various lengths of time blocking the view of others or they stand blocking the path!
Note- the zoo and night safari are far from anything else so we would recommend that if your coming for the night safari -eat before you arrive. As mentioned in other reviews food here is very expensive!

Nothing really special.
Most of the animals are hard to see but it's night time, so expected.
The big disappointment are the restaurants and food outlets.
The zoo is miles from no where so there is no where else to eat, except there and they know it.
Prices are outrageously expensive, the sort of prices you would expect of a high end city restaurant.
I paid $27.60 for two tubs of gelato ice cream that held two scoops each. Anywhere else they would have cost at most $12.00 to $14.00 for two.
The ticket office opens at 5:30 for the 7:15 show. If you are waiting, beware, there is no where to sit except at the tables reserved for restaurant and bar patrons. Another way to entice you to spend big on their food.
There is no seating in the public areas.

We ended up signing up for the Viator Tour and it was a wise decision. We were picked up at our hotel in a small van and driven to a central location where other vans met up. We then boarded a bus and on the way out of town to the zoo, given information on what would be happening, and where to meet afterward. We did not opt for the dinner and for us this worked.
We started by walking around with the group seeing night small animals like the cat which fished at night and many others. Often you would hear, ""Ooh, look,"" and we all did. After a period of time we all walked to the tram lines and boarded a tram for the Night Safari which was very interesting for all. We then had a break to grab an ice cream, beer, or other treat, eat, and then head to to line for the night show in an outdoor amphitheater. The show was a bit predictable and more for children who loved it, but probably worth seeing.

Must admit it takes a long time to get there (over an hour) but we had already paid for our 3 day travel pass. Arrived at 9.15pm and everyone appeared to be leaving. We were on the safari tram and exploring the zoo within 5 minutes of getting there. Zoo was really good and peaceful and had just enough time to walk all the walk trails. Another hour would have been good.

Last busses are at 12.15am but take no notice of this. We took the 11pm bus but by the time we were on the train and needed to change lines to get to Clarke quay/china town the trains had stopped running so needed to jump in a taxi!!!

1) walking trails - here you cover half of the safari getting to have a closer look at the animals. Takes about 1-2 hours depending on your speed.

2) Tram ride - they take you on a tram ride to see the bigger/wilder animals with a recorded voice that explains all you need to know about the animal.

With limited time in Singapore many friends advised us not to miss out on going to the Night Safari. It's great, fantastic, amazing were some comments by our friends so we thought must be good so we put it on the list. We left Suntec Centre on our Duck & Hippo Sight Seeing Group(another review) tour bus around 5.30 - 6.00 cannot remember exact time. Many other tour groups offer deals as well. About what seemed a 30-40 minute drive we arrived to a carpark of buses and cars. Upon entering front entrance it was like OMG look at how many people are lined up. Stood in line for about 30 minutes now dusk they open the gates. Everyone races again to line up to get on the safari trams about an eight or ten seat open buggy style bus/buggy at 5 minute intervals. Oh great another wait, the line constantly moves but its another 15 minute wait. Finally we are on our way with our driver and guide speaker who spoke so fast and muffled through the microphone l could not catch a word she was saying and l was sitting in the front row in front of her. Ok l'm now getting excited as we drive slowly along the road with thick lush jungle like plants and it's nice and dark. I'm thinking we are going to see some wonderful animals in their habitat. Now when a person visits a zoo they expect to see a variety of animals don't they. A lot of enclosures are open of course the animals won't jump out as they can't but obviously they have just been fed so are quite relaxed resting or just no where to be seen. We passed a lot of enclosures and seen some lions, an elephant, a leopard, some deer, some type of cow or buffalo, some more deer, some more deer oh and let's not forget some more deer and several other variety of bovine animals. Apparently we passed a zebra, giraffe, wallaby and invisible animals as they were no where to be seen. Not even half way through and it wasnt that long, my husband and l lost interest. After we got off we had over an hour to wait before our return bus trip so even though there was food areas we had made other plans for dinner on our return so we just sat around. We did not want to wander off on path trails only to miss our ride home. Our interest was gone. Get me out of here.
Now to summarize if you want to go to the zoo go during the day, l am sure it is so much better and you can actually see a lot more animals by walking the foot trails. The Night Safari is a waste of time and money, sorry but l just cannot find so many varieties of one animal interesting with such a lead up to expect an amazing experience. Just because they are from different regions they all look pretty much the same, better still save your money and go to one of our own zoos here in Australian cities where we have an abundance of different animals. Sorry guys but it's a big NO GO from me for the Night Safari.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:39:13.321338

The most interesting part on the tram for me was seeing Malaysian tapirs sleeping on the street with no care.

The walks were the reason I would give this place 5 stars. Perhaps we were just lucky but we were able to see the tigers, leopards, hyenas, and many more pushed up right against the window, essentially 10 centimetres away from these magnificent animals. Never been so close before.

Most importantly, the animals looked extremely healthy and active compared to other places I have been to. In my home country, many zoos and such are shameful and mistreat animals disgustingly.

I recommend you show up about 10pm. You will have a good chance of skipping the lines.

Near the entrance you will get your tickets which was a very quick and efficient process. Shortly after that, just past the ticket booth they may have the fire breather show. A couple of young local men will come out in a animal skin and shoot flames all over the place. This is definitely a crowd-pleaser.

Once you make your way past this you may or may not have much of a line to wait in before you are allowed to begin a walking tour. I started off with the walking tour as it appeared if we saved the tram tour for later we would have even less lines to contend with.

There are several paths to follow but it is not difficult to plan your routes and catch all of the critters in their nocturnal habitats. Being a nocturnal attraction, there is very little light and picture taking is very difficult, particularly because they ask that you do not use flash. You will want a high res camera with the ability to adjust your settings up to and including night mode. Otherwise, you will have a difficult time getting many post worthy photos.

They have many critters and not just from the local areas. They have many from Africa as well. You see more of the larger African species when you take the tram with guided tour.

We made it to the end of the walking part of the tour back to the entrance and hopped in a much smaller line to enjoy the tram ride with guide tour. If we had waited just a bit longer the line would have been near nonexistent. As it was we had a few very unhappy kids who only wanted to be in bed by this hour.

Once finished with our tram ride it was back out of the park where we past through the restaurant, snack bar and souvenir area. The food does appear decent and of course the items for sale are all zoo based animal replicas.

Surprisingly, getting back to our hotel this late at night was not hard to do as they had plenty of taxis waiting outside but the traffic was still moderate but moving as we headed back into the city proper.

It is well set out and prepared for the onslaught of people arriving at 5.30 when it opens.
When we entered at 7.15 we chose to go straight on the tram, which was 40 mins and had excellent views of most animals. In some cases feeling a little too close (I'm looking at you hyenas and lions!).
This area of the park is completely separate from the zoo, with different animals (some repeats) and a different layout. It is lovely to see the animals more awake and moving around freely.
We then did all 4 walking trails in an hour, which was interesting as you got to see different animals than from the tram.
We then got a more crowed bus back to the mrt and made it back to marina bay in an hour. An excellent evening out.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:39:48.547703

We waited about 20 minutes and then we were on the tram which was nice after walking all day. Most of the animals were visible but it was like seeing them at dusk. Commentary was interesting.

Prior to the entry there is also entertainment available outside the park - there was a fire eating show at 9pm.

Upon first entry the queue to the tram ride was unbelievably long. However a good idea is to go through the walking trail first - it takes about an hour to get through and at the end the crowd should clear for the tram ride. Not sure if this will apply for earlier entries. Skipping the tram ride entirely might not be a good idea since the route that the tram takes is not accessible via foot.

However, the trade-off is that entering late will mean missing most of the shows - the Creatures of the Night's last show is 9.30pm, and there are limited seats. Lion and tiger feedings also end by then.

The park offers a good range of animals, and seeing them in the dark is a whole different experience. It's still bright enough to take photos, but please do not use flash photography.

The tram ride experience is a lot more up close and intimate. There were animal exhibits on both sides with an English audio commentary playing overhead. We even saw the buffalo sleeping on the grass patch right next to the road! The tram also stopped for when the animals crossed the road, which was quite a sight.

Perhaps the only thing that may spoil your visit is the tourists themselves. Do wear comfortable walking shoes as the park is quite big and spaced out.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:39:55.777695

On arrival we had our buffet meal with a selection of Chinese and local dishes which was excellent. We then went on a 45 minute tram ride through the zoo where they have highlighted areas where the animals come out at night to forage. It's all lit by moonlight so you can see clearly without disturbing the animals. What animals you see is down to luck but most are visible.These tram rides are very popular and best pre booked or you could have a long wait. The tour companies have specific times and trams allocated to them.
There are several walking trails of various lengths to see smaller nocturnal animals. We only had a short time and did one of the shorter trails but managed to see plenty animals.
Our trip ended with an 'animals of the night' show. This was enjoyable but concentrated too much on showmanship rather than showing the animals. It was more aimed at promoting environmental issues.

The Premium safari adventurer tour was excellent - highly recommend to adults with or without children! We checked into the zoo at 6:15pm and had about an hour to enjoy a buffet in the Ulu Ulu restaurant. From there, we met our friendly and very knowledgable guide. We were taken to reserved seats in the nightly show (Creatures of the night), and then enjoyed 2.5 hours on a private tour with our guide. I think this tour can have maximum 8 guests. Our guide was excellent at pointing out the hard-to-see nocturnal animals and explaining information about them, that we never would have got on our own. A highlight of the evening was being able to feed the three female elephants!

There is a stop mid way where you can get off and explore local trails on your own as well as trails you can follow right from the start of the zoo. They are readily marked as to what you can see on each trail. Maps are also given out when you first enter.
Following this is a night show every hour on the nearby stage.
We did the tram ride twice, first with our group tour and the tram used a recording to describe what we saw.
The second time, we did it with a live zookeeper who knew the animals, and made it more interesting with stops at key locations. This is the best route.
We were fortunate to be there on a mid week night when there were few crowds so had a great time. We understand at other times the lineups are long and it takes time to wait for the tram.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:40:25.747516

The main route can only be taken with the train. Opposite as the Zoo this is the better option to see the animals. The ride is about 40 mins and informative. The animals are lit with pale lights like it was full moon but you can see them clearly from the train. You can't use flash on your phone/camera so it's hard to take any normal pictures.
You can choose to go around on foot and it takes a few hours only, but you see fewer animals, though you have more time to look at them. Really interesting experience I would visit it again!",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:40:26.129486

You really can't say what you will see there, for instance, I saw the leopards up close (to my delight), but I couldn't find the flying squirrels. I guess it adds to the fun because we enjoyed searching for the animals, and it was so cool once we spotted them. You can really see the animals roaming about at night, very interesting! The Mangrove Walk was the most exciting, the bats were huge and really, really close. The tram ride was very good also. Some tips:

1. This is really popular with tourists so arrive early, or get tickets in advance. Even though the park opens at 19:15, there were many people already waiting as early as 6PM
2. Do the walking trails first, and go for the tram ride afterwards, the tram queues can be very long when the park opens

We pre-booked our tickets which specifics an entry time. When we arrived though, there was a long queue that everyone had to wait in, and we assume it's because they let in large groups in batches. It took us about 45 minutes to get through the queues to get on the tram that offers a narrated tour around the zoo. It wasn't fun standing outside in the muggy air, but the tram ride was worth it. It's very difficult to get pictures because of the darkness and movement, so we put our cameras away and just enjoyed the experience. The guide was knowledgeable and funny, and it was really neat to see the animals so active at night. If you have the time, you should definitely check this out!

Note, the Night Safari is a decent distance away from the centre of the city. There are bus options, or you can take a cab which wasn't that expensive.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 15:40:43.956223

A lot of animals become very active at this time, and so it can be a great time to spot them. We really enjoyed traveling in the tram and there is a good and varied collection of animals. There are foot trails so you can hop on and off if you wish to explore further routes in your own time.

The queues to get in are huge as are the ones for the trams, it took absolutely ages for us to finally get going-also when you hop off you have to wait again until there is a space somewhere for you to get back on, this was a real pain. However, we did have a really enjoyable evening seeing animals in a completely different setting and I would definitely recommend giving this trip a go-just be aware it's a really long way out if you are making your own way from the city centre via the MRT and public busses (as we did) will be much quicker and easier to try to find a trip that is heading there anyway and hop onto that.
We got an organised bus back home to the hotel again after for 5 dollars each which was much cheaper and quicker than making our own way again-but we enjoyed the experience using the public transport system and going through the suburbs on local busses it's all part of the adventure.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:40:44.626879

I have been fortunate to see a lot of these animals in daylight and in the wild. OK It's a zoo but to see these animals at night gave it a different slant entirely.
Following that there was a fire eating act which was enjoyable, alternatively we could have opted for a walking tour, then back to the bus for the transport back to Singapore.

It was easily accessible by MRT and bus with our Singapore travel pass (directions on night safari website). The zoo experience was totally different, with a tram ride and tour through big animals, dropping you off at 2 points which take you on 4 walking trails where you can see smaller animals. We went on a drizzly night so there were no lines, but the animals were super active- we also followed a keeper around for a bit of feeding time which helped. The lighting at the zoo is specially designed to imitate moonlight, and where possible natural barriers like moats and rivers are used instead of fences which felt as authentic as a zoo can feel. I'd recommend getting there early (7 30 or so) so you have plenty of time to do the shows and all the trails- we arrived about 8 30 and took our time but didn't get to see creatures of the night show.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 15:40:51.195518

Dinner was average, almost poor to be honest and seemed expensive for what you got, although everything in Singapore is costly.

Most impressive was the 20 seconds as we passed the tiger, but that's right opposite some bears that didn't get a look-in

On alighting, we had time to walk some of the paths and this was much more rewarding; the surface is good and well-lit and you have time to see the animals from whichever angle they're best viewed. Excellent view of a couple of jaguars just a metre away through the glass

I wasn't sure what to expect. I had wrongly assumed that most animals would be asleep at night but they were all wide awake. It was great to see lions prowling around whereas during day time they tend to be sleeping.

The one problem is getting there. No MRT in the vicinity and the nearest MRT stop is Ang Mo Kio on the North East (Red) Line. From the bus station there are buses to the Zoo but it is a 35 minute journey on the bus. For our return we caught one of the regular private buses that run back to Singapore via Orchard Road and the fare was less than the charge for the combined MRT and bus. It would be better to take one of these buses in both directions but take care which operator you choose. Some offer a hotel pick-up with Night Safari entry but charge considerably more for this.

Plenty of eateries and other entertainment to keep you amused but don't plan to be there for more than a couple of hours.,02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:02.034391

So after buying our timed ticket which wasn't due for another 30 minutes and then just walking in at any old time as that is what everyone else was doing we then joined the disneyesque cattle queue to get on an over full tram to basically see cattle, sheep, goats, deer and pigs. Yes there were a few lions, tigers and bears but nothing that you presumably could not see during the day at the zoo across the road.The only reason why they were up was that there was food in front of them.
So my advice, if you want to see normal zoo animals go across the road during the day time. If you absolutely have to go here forget about the tram just go on the walking trail (or wait until about 9pm when there was no queue for the tram) at least this way you get to see a few genuinely nocturnal animals such as bats flying around up close.
Also for a place that has brilliant public transport it really is a bit of a hassle getting there by mrt and then bus..come on guys a few signs to the nearest bus stop when you come out of the mrt would be helpful",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:09.005589

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JACOB P,344805595,03-02-2016,4,Night safari a unique experience,"The easiest way to reach the Zoo is by taxi and is about 30 minutes drive from the city. You can also go by bus or by MRT (North-South Red line) and then a connection bus or cab. The Singapore Attractions Express shuttle operates from designated places in the city. If you use MRT for returning, please make sure that you take a bus on time to catch the last MRT train. Last MRT from Ang Mo Kio is at 11.30pm.

We did Singapore Zoo during day time and waited for the night safari. If you do it on the same day, you can save on taxi. Besides, you get combo tickets also. For people who feel that it is too much of zoo for a day and night and if you have enough time, you can split it into two days. The Night Safari is open from 7.15pm until 12pm.

We were there on a holiday. So, the queues were long, entrance was so crowded and the waiting was too long. There is a food court next to the entrance, which we saw to be packed. A ‘Thumbuakar’ performance is held next to the entrance. We enjoyed it while waiting in the queue for the gate to open. Those who come late will miss this performance.

The Park is divided into seven zones namely, Himalayan Foothills, Indian Subcontinent, Equatorial Africa, Indo-Malayan Region, Asian Riverine Forests, Nepalese River Valley and Burmese Hillside. The park has a special area for small critters, like reptiles. You can either take the tram ride with English commentary or the four walking trails. As this is a ride to see the nocturnal animals, the whole area is dimly lit and you will have to watch very closely to see these animals. Even though the animals are not in cages as in a zoo, you cannot say they are in their natural habitat. However, you can see them moving around as in the wild. All of them were active during night. The walking trails are very interesting and it was lovely watching the animals so close at night. Some of the animals you can see are the lions, tigers, elephants, deer, antelopes, hyenas, giraffes, zebras, hippopotami, rhinoceros, wolves, tapirs etc.

Later in the evening there’s a Creatures of the Night Show in the amphitheatre. The first show is at 7.30pm and later shows every after that until the last show at 10.30pm. Make sure to reach there well before time to ensure seating.

Carry a map when you are doing the ‘walking trail’. It’s quite a large place, so it’s better you reach early so that you cover the entire area within the safari timings. It’s really difficult to get good photographs because of the dim light and flash photography is prohibited.

There are restaurants located outside the main entrance. Zebra Café inside the park offers refreshment and snacks.

Overall the night safari is not to be missed out as it’s a unique opportunity to see the animals at night.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:10.437265

We purchased tickets online as a park hopper deal with the Singapore Zoo and as a result the tickets allowed immediate entry as those purchased at the park are timed entry and you may have to wait to enter.
Food options are good although you may want to have an early meal or come back well before closing as a pit-stop to avoid missing out due to food venues closing before park close.
Take the tram early to find the layout of the park and then you are free to explore the park on foot through the well signed and lighted paths. Much better opportunity to photograph the animals so you can relax and enjoy the tram without feeling you need to take photos and videos.
The animal show is well worth it so make sure you don't miss that especially if you are traveling with children.

We did both the Zoo and Night Safari (yes these are different parks) on the same day which made for a long day. You may wish to spread your visit if doing both, over multiple days. You have 7 days to use the park hopper once activated but this only allows each park to be visited once.

Transport was easy with MRT to Ang Mo Kio station and follow signs to bus 138 which departs every 15 minutes to and from the Zoo. Last bus is clearly sign posted so you should not miss it if you plan to travel by public transport.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:10.759869

Also an entertaining session watching the animal show in the amphitheatre . This was my fourth visit to the Night Safari , and I'm still not tired of it.

We had planned our visit as follows : Taxi after early lunch to Zoo from Raffles City hotel ( hassle free travel option ) . Zoo exploration all afternoon till 6 p.m. closing time . Eat at one of the many food outlets outside the Zoo's main gates . Walk the very short distance to the Night Safari , to get there at opening time . Go straight to the amphitheatre near the entrance for the first show ( thus avoiding the initial long queues for the Night Safari road train ) .Only then take the Night Safari road train , since the queue for this by now much shorter . It all went as planned .... though it'll be a long time before I forgive my partner for eating a KFC at 6 p.m. rather than anything more interesting !

Singapore Zoo is easy to get to by public transport - take the Metro on the red North south line to ANG MO KIO and then transfer to the bus at the bus Interchange - bus No 138 - whihc runs every 10 - 15 minutes until 00 15 hours (after the night zoo closes). The cost of the metro/bus is included in the in Singapore public transport card.

Try to get to the Zoo early and get a ticket for a 19 15 entrance - entry times are 19 15, 20 15, 21 15.
There are many venues to eat at- e.g Bongo Burgers which is Ok
At the night zoo - do not miss the Creatures of the Night display - at 19 30, 20 30, 21 30.

We arrived for 19 15 entry and made our way to see the initial Creatures of the Night show and then made over to catch the tram for the trip around the zoo.
BEWARE of the pushing, shoving and overall rudeness - and the mass of people trying to board the trams - one of our party was verbally abused and shoved by a group of Indian tourists and told to ""get out of the way"" - be prepared. Staff try their best but some visitors can be extremely RUDE

The tram travels around the various enclosures inside the enclosures where the animals are close by - there is an opportunity to get out and walk around to see the lions/tigers before re-boarding another tram

When we visited we got entry for 19 15 - joined the huge queue - and then visited the 19 30 Creatures of the Night show and the the tram tour after that - aprrox. 20 15 the queues were huge and as stated earlier pushing, shoving and rudeness. The trip around the park was aver an hour with a stop to see the lions/tigers. At the end of the tram ride there is an opportunity to see the Wallaby Park - but as Aussies we have seen plenty of these at home.

A day so packed with people and Thaipusam on top of it all! So because of the traffic due to the blocked roads, when we got there the queue was miles long. We booked through the hostel and the rate was 10SGD cheaper than online. The self ticket redemption part was a bit tricky because there were only TWO machines and when one would falter, the other would be working, and it just went on like that. My partner and I had to queue in both lines because of these faulty machines.

Of course by the time we entered, the tram ride line was sooo long so we walked ALL the foot trails which was fun and not too crowded. Rangers were really nice and helpful especially the guy near the Sloth Bears. He advised us to finish all the trails first, then do the tram later. After the trails, we decided to watch the 9.30pm Creatures Of The Night show which is not to be missed!!! It was just about half an hour and the animals were really well trained. Jeremy, our host was very well-spoken and funny, the binturong and otters were absolutely adorable! After that, we did the tram ride which was awesome, just wish the giraffe came closer. Some of these animals are not nocturnal I think because they were definitely sleeping.

Only downside is that it is horribly difficult to take pictures with phones and cameras at night. Especially with no flash allowed. Next time we will do the Singapore Zoo instead!

Firstly, kudos the the management and crew at the night safari. Top notch maintenance, attitude, love for animals, passion and patient to explain. Superb people! Don't fret that you may lose your way or unsure which trail to take, there will always be someone ready to help!

Overall the park is well laid out so it's difficult to lose your way. A little advice to anyone interested would be to purchase the tickets online (you get to immediately enter, and avoid queueing and purchasing on the spot), enjoy some discounts and most importantly, give you more time for a leisurely stroll. Ask when the feeding time is for the tiger etc, which helps to time your walk around the safari.

One absolute must is the train/tram ride. This ride unlocks certain areas of the park that's not accessible via foot. Must do this! If I had to re-do, try to get seats in the middle. Too far front, you sometimes get blind-sides by the time the animals are spotted by the guide (and you don't get much time to admire the creatures before the train moves on); too far back, you may not see the funny expressions the guide makes (or hear clearly enough).

So the only slight disappointment was the creatures of the night were not too active when I was there, and quite Abit of renovation on-going, and bumped into some unruly folks who uses flash photography! DO NOT USE FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY!

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/JasonEightyFive,341411449,20-01-2016,4,Get to see the animals 'up close',"Singapore Zoo is designed with the intention of wanting to give visitors an experience (and illusion) that you're so close to the animals you could reach out and touch them (you obviously can't), but it makes for a great, realistic experience; add the element of nightfall and you're in for a real thrill.

The night safari starts with a tram-type ride through zoo grounds, narrated by the rangers on the animals you encounter and the reason for their various significances. Once done, you're on your own for a walk at your own pace along a similar trail, with various education reading points so you know what you are staring at in the thick shrub.

You'll be bombarded by Tour Operators offering skip the line or VIP tickets to get you going quicker: provided you haven't caught the zoo on a particular school excursion day, the queues move quickly so the VIP tickets are unnecessary. In the Tram, ensure your camera flash is off - not only is it highly harmful to the wildlife, it also makes for an unpleasant public telling off via the loudspeaker if you're caught flashing away. When walking on foot, don't rush and be cautious of your footing. You'll find zoo guides along the way to ensure you are following the right paths and guide you across the busy tram way paths. If traveling with kids, keep them close - it can be easy to get lost in the mass of snaking roads, pathways and junctions if you're not paying attention to the signage.",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:28.817261

I just don't remember lining up 7 years ago but that's alright we lined up to get in. at 7:15pm, there was the fire show in front of the entrance, but with me being not so tall person, I couldn't see any of it standing and there was only two performers (on the brochure there's 6) I know it's not always like that with difficulty finding staff all the time but that was out for me, I couldn't see it. So after going through the entrance, there's another line to go on the tram. We didn't really feel like lining up again, so we went and watched the creature show which was cute but very short probably about 15 minutes. So after the show, we ran to line up for the tram, but there were like 5 different tram stations for tour groups so we got a bit lost there but we were told to go to the one near the entrance on number one. When we got there, the line was massive and we again, lined up for about 20 minutes to get onto the tram and everyone was just using in.

When we finally got onto the tram, the ride was pleasant. It was different from all the other zoos and the ride went for around 45 minutes. There's a couple of trails where you can actually get off and walk around. We got off at one of them and walked around.

Overall, I don't recommend this if you don't want to line up. It's a different experience so some people might like it, but I just really didn't want to line up for that long (all together maybe I lined up for an hour). Maybe it was the busy season because I don't remember lining up last time!

Just be prepared to wait in a line if you go!! easy access to get there. taxis or buses.",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 15:41:29.187076

Better, easier and more comfy in other countries guys.
We opted for the night zoo, them you see a little show, cute, but nothing like SeaWorld, dream world shows, a lot smaller in excitement etc.

Eat elsewhere, quite expensive and nothing special, great for little kids but keep an eye pad handy to amuse them when you line up!

The major part of the night zoo ticket is a tram ride for 20 mins to see the night animals, that was cool, nice to not line up, but it's dark and the team doesn't stop, so you see them for 2 secs as you go by. Quite funny!

Average to be honest! They show a fire twirling thing as you arrive, the Chinese loved it, but we know Byron and Thailand and it's not anywhere near as good as that, as much as they worked hard and tried their best.

Singapore's hot and humid weather got the best of us an we were completely covered in sweat by the time we got on the tram.

The tram ride itself was very fun and well-done. The zoo appears to be working towards conservation efforts and makes an attempt to dissuade customers from purchasing ivory and other illegal animal parts. I commend them for highlighting conservation.

Tip: take the public bus to the night safari. Our taxi ride one-way from Orchard Road cost $36 USD. Buses do run to the Night Safari, and if you have the tourist pass, you should be able to use the bus as a part of the unlimited pass. We also really enjoyed the gelato they sell there while we waited in line.

From reading other reviews, it looks like you can purchase some sort of priority tram tickets and dinner packge. I would recommend trying to purchase these priority tram seats. Otherwise, the long wait was enough to make me never want to return. I can only imagine that waiting in a line with small children would be even more difficult.

Made the first enquiry mid November to which I was given all the information and told 2-3 weeks time confirmation will be sent. I was excited so 2 weeks in to the enquiry I emailed, it was referred onwards and was told that it had not been 2-3 weeks as mentioned, our place was reserved. No payment details though
So i waited.
A month later I emailed again
I was already a little frustrated as I had tried organising everything before our holiday. Was informed that the 'rates' hadn't been confirmed / changes may have occurred... Next day I was given an email with the pricing, link to the site for general info. Request for deposit. Busy enjoying our last day in Phuket Thailand before we went on a trip into the national park I didn't respond.

During our holiday we have been away for a few days in the national park (5th-7th). No net. No phone. No hassles.
During this stay the safari emailed on the 6th titled FIRST FOLLOW UP. At this stage I should mention during my holiday I have an auto'out of office' email saying I am away. They wanted to hear from us within 48hours. So today I got an email titled GIVING UP BOOKING. We were told that 'due to the lack of confirmation' from our end... You're kidding me. We tried to organise this well and truly in advance. First come first served (their words). we were first come and... Left out to dry.

After two emails expressing my disappointment and intent to cancel, I then had to explain in another email that I had already written to them about if I wanted to continue or not with the booking.

Overall a pointless endeavour. Can't believe I considered spending $200 each at a place that can't even get their bookings and emailing customers right...

The bus picked us up from our hotel and we waited at some back storage area ( which was a bit weird) for the other guests to arrive and away we went.

The tour guide explained the programme and the option of getting a meal while at the zoo, from one of the many eateries.

We opted to take the tram ride first and then walk and see the night show after.

The tram ride was informative and we got to see heaps of animals we hadn't seen before, which was cool.

As we got off the tram the night show was starting to fill so we took a seat on the right side of the seating area near the end of the row. Unfortunately we couldn't see what was happening on the waterfall, so try to get a central seat to get a better view.

The show was fun and well presented and worth seeing.

The self guided walks are well laid out and we got to see all the animals without being rushed.

We decided to eat back at the hotel afterwards, so didn't partake in the food, but we didn't really have time anyway.

After the massive line up you then wait for the carts to collect you and the go for a 25 minuter drive around the parka and look at all of the animals, where you can finally relax after that hectic line up.

But plan to get there early to catch the Thumbuakar Fire show at 6:45pm. As soon as the safari opens, proceed to your right and catch the first show of Creatures of the Night at 7:15pm. Both shows are very entertaining!

After the show, do not join the crowds to catch the trams to take the 30 minute ride around the park. Tram 1 ( English tour) has a very very long queue so don’t waste your time. Instead do the 3 walking trails first. Yes it can be very dark and scary but there are park personnel at some places to help you. You will get adrenaline rushes from time to time. For me, it was when I realised the spotted hyena was too close for comfort. But there were nice surprises like I saw a little bat sucking on banana juice strategically placed along a path on the fishing cat trail. Unfortunately it’s very shy and will fly off when more people come.

I caught tram no. 1 at 8:45pm. By then, there was no longer a queue. The tram ride showed many animals you cannot see on the walking trails. Sometimes the animals like the tapir, some deer were less than a meter away from the tram that night.

A very enjoyable 3 hour visit!",09-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 15:42:31.562224

Sadly and very frankly it’s an over-hyped place which the local administration has very cleverly succeeded in putting it on the global map. There is a tram ride which takes you around the park in 35 min. The wildlife enclosures are very poorly lit, you can hardly see the animals. The recorded voice in tram, for example, will tell you about the spotted deer, but what you can see barely is a silhouette of an animal in dark. You can hardly make out whether it is spotted or not. Thereafter, you can walk around the park on foot, that’s going to take another 1 Hr, but that’s equally terrible since you hardly get to see any animals, they are either sleeping in hideouts or barely visible in poor light. The walk path takes you to places where the tram does not go, but it’s of no use either. A total waste of time and a very expensive one too. I was very disappointed, expected it to be much better. Give it a miss and you will be happy. Nicely managed though, people around to guide you everywhere. Do carry an umbrella during the walk. If it rains there is hardly anywhere you can go. Very few rain enclosure options. There is also a show ‘Creatures of the earth’, but if you cannot see it due to some reason, don’t worry, you have not missed anything. This is an open air auditorium.

The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo. There are different exhibits, shows and zones. At the Night Safari you can find more than 130 species of animals and some of the animals are on the Endangered List. Some of the animals you can see in the Night Safari include Oryx, Flamingo, Asian lions, White African lion, Spotted hyena, Sloth bear, Nile Hippo, Malayan tiger, Clouded leopards, Hog, Barking deer, red deer, Asian elephants and American bison. The animals are visible by using a light that resembles moonlight which doesn’t disturb the animals.
The tour is operated on a guided tram with audio commentary in English. The tram tour lasts about 20 min. Don’t miss out Creatures of the Night show which is about half an hour long. It occurs at the Amphitheatre at 7:15pm, 8:30pm, 9:30pm and 10:30pm. You see otters that do recycling and so many other animals showing their learned or natural talent.
Night Safari is opened 7:15pm - 12am (Last entry at 11:15pm). Entry fee for adult is S$47 and Child $31 and there are many discounts available like buying tickets online and buying multi-park ticket (for Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari, Singapore Zoo). Try to arrive early or buy your entry ticket early, the 7:15pm entry will be sold out.

The night safari brings you close to the animals, with the minimum required barriers. The fact that it's dark brings a whole new mood to the zoo. If you need photos of zoo animals, they're not going to turn out well. Better to search online.
1. I happened to enter the bat area while a scientist was feeding the bats bananas from her hands, and she let me feed them too. Amazing experience. Made me feel more comfortable with bats. Glad it helps habituate bats to humans, so the workers can better monitor them.

2. The tram was nice. It's around a half hour - 45 mins, and it goes around part of the park. It's a nice intro, but walking the park is better.

With all the hyped about this being one of the top zoos in the world I was set for a world class experience. The concept is brilliant, the atmosphere at night is amazing but getting to see the animals,, i.e. the reason one goes to a zoo, was pretty weak.
The tram ride was horrible. You get schooled over and over about the importance of not using flash photography, both for the animals and fellow visitors’ experience, and to not make any noises that might startle the animals. We get on the tram and get blinded right away as the staff are going around taking flash photos of you sitting there so they can get more money out of your pocket. Then the tram we were on squealed like a banshee every time our non-attentive driver hit the brakes. You could not hear yourself think as the noise of the brakes was so loud. Additionally, if our driver had of spent 25% as much time focusing on his job of driving instead of flirting with the female staff member he would have been more effective at slowing down so we could actually see a few of the animals that were out.

I really enjoyed my visit, the animals were well cared for and seemed happy. There were gift shops and restaurants on site too.
Definitely do the walking tour first and then come back to the tram when the queues have died down.

It’s a good idea to book your taxi in advance. I left the Safari at 11pm and there were no grabs, I had missed the shuttle bus and the queue for taxis was awfully long. I was lucky to get a taxi, as after the next one to mine there was a wait of 45 mins.",01-2019,Solo,2020-01-30 15:42:50.324393

I was able to book this through the hotel concierge which was great as it meant I was picked up and dropped off again before & after.

On arrival at the zoo, the entrance can have really long queues but as I was booked with a tour group we got straight through ( I would definatley recommend booking prior to the visit). The safari takes you on a tour round the zoo at night which is exciting as you have no idea what you are going to see lurking in the dark! However, the reason I am not giving it the 5 stars is that it can be hit or miss whether the animals will make an appearance. Various factors such as noise and light can affect what you may or may not see so so one group may have a better experience than the next.

Once the guided tour is complete there is plenty of time for you to go and explore on your own by foot. The routes are well signposted and there are plenty of staff about so you won't get lost and is completely safe.

There are also various shows on offer such as a fire show and a show where some of the animals are introduced to the audience. There can be some audience participation too which adds to the fun.

The safari lasts between 30-45 minutes followed by an animal show. Though it definitely seems that the animals are very well taken care of, I was slightly skeptic of spotting them all in a particular zone which was light up and wasn't very happy with them having to sense the presence of humans in trains and constant voices playing through the speakers. I am not well aware of how the animals are looked after in this zoo, but it wasn't something that I enjoyed well.

I arrived at 7pm, initially queued in the wrong place, then when I got to the ticket booth found the 7.15pm tickets had sold out and had to wait for 8.15pm entry (not sure why they do timed slots as it just seems to make the crowds worse). I then had to hang around for an hour, there's no seating unless you want to eat in very touristy restaurants (think theme parks), among lots of jostling crowds. I understand why people would want to go early if you have young children, but if you don't have this factor to consider here are my top tips for a more pleasurable experience!

- Buy your tickets on-line which will give you a guaranteed time entry (and discount)
- I think the 9.15pm slot would be the best entry time (some of the earlier crowds have then left and you would have enough time to see everything)
- When you get into the park head straight for the walking trails, there are four and they take about 20 min each (my experience was that the masses that you queue with then just head straight to the tram and queue all over again!) the trails were really quiet and I had the first one to myself
- You could then do the tram ride around the park after this (from 10pm onwards the queues for the trams seemed non existent), these run constantly throughout the evening leaving every 5-10mins. You don't book a time slot for these just wait to get on.
- Creatures of the Night show gets very busy, again try and go for a late slot. It's a bit gimmicky so I would prioritise doing the walking trails.
- And don't forget to wear bug spray!",11-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:00.638429

Everyone arrives for the 7.30 tour so to avoid the queues I did the walk first. The animals I saw were very underwhelming, most were just silhouettes. It was raining so this may have had an impact.

By the time I finished there was no queue for the tour. In fact I got a seat to myself so could easily see both sides. The tour was the highlight with the animals fed to encourage them into viewable positions.

The Creatures of the Night show was also enjoyable.

Overall though, I usually enjoy zoos, but I found this underwhelming. Perhaps I should have visited the zoo in daylight.",10-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:07.526186

Went on a Thursday evening, when there weren’t too many crowds. Got there by MRT and the shuttle bus - very easy. Got there for entry at 7:15, and went to the first show. That was OK but not stunning.

Then did the tram ride which helped orientate us with what was out there. Loved the elephant exhibit, which showcased them in great majesty.

We then walked round the park, taking till 10:30 to do so, at which point we caught the shuttle bus back.

Walking round enabled us to spend time where we wanted to - hyenas were fun, we always enjoy bats and the large fruit bats didn’t disappoint, saw the tiger from close quarters etc. What comes across is the feeling of being a fly on the wall of these animals as they go about their business.

Can’t believe how many people cannot understand the instructions on the tram: “no flash” - multiple people on our tram car took flash shots throughout the tour, and just ignored all instructions from the driver not to do so.

Would suggest to take water / drink with you and not waste time in the food and beverage locations.

There was a Creatures of the Night Show at 7.15 I saw that ga e a nice introduction to the park and what we were going to see.

I then took a tram ride through the park- it was beautiful and relaxing- some of the animals in the free range area, came very close to the tram to say ‘Hello’. The tram ride lasted for about 30-40 minutes with information given about the animals and conservation.

If you didn’t get your fill of animals, you could also do 4 walks through the jungle to see the animals a bit more closely.

Coming from a Singaporean's perspective and experience, the Night Safari is mostly visited by large tourist groups which is something you'll hardly see at the other parks, and one of the things that they usually do is head for the tram safari ride, which explains why other tourists complain of long waiting hours.

What I usually do is head for either the walking trails or catch the ""Creatures of the Night"" show first, and wait for the tourist groups to leave the park after they'd finished with the tram safari ride and shows.

It's not really a must to catch the tram safari ride first because when I take the tram after most of the tour groups are gone, you will realise how little people there are queuing for the tram and you'll get to enjoy it in peace, because tour groups are notoriously noisy.

Don't expect to see a lot of animals along the tram safari route, because they're animals after all, and while I heard people complaining about the dim lighting, do note that it's been specially designed to mimic moonlight, hence adding to the theme of a nocturnal world, from my point of view, and won't affect the animals as much.

All in all, the Night Safari offers a truly unique experience that you won't get elsewhere in the world and a little trick about making the most out of the whole experience is to not follow the ""rat race"".",03-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:09.702592

I hate being channeled through a large, crowded fast food area, and then I had to queue about twenty five minutes to get a place on a trolley bus. The drive round wasn't my thing, either, with a rather sensationalized recorded commentary on each set of animals we saw. I did enjoy seeing a few of them - the Asian Lions, the white African Lions, and the Flamingos especially, but the fact that they were on show for us, and probably every other trolley bus that made it's way round the road, made me remember that I don't like zoos - the animals cannot have much freedom to roam where they want to, and some of them did look jaded. I cut my losses after the trolley bus experience, and made my way back to my hotel.

The commentator spoke with very clear English so it was very easy to understand. She impressed me by knowing how to say turn off the flash in 10 different languages as well!

The show was great, a cute Chinese girl named Jocy made the show unforgettable trying to fool the bearcat. She was unsuccessful!

After the show I jumped on the tram and I was impressed by the space the animals had. Normally I’m against zoo’s but the animals in this one really seem to live a pretty normal and nice lives with plenty of space to roam around.

I decided to avail the Singapore Zoo + Rainforest Lumina promo admission they currently are offering for this month. I loved the open concept of the zoo and how the institution is conscientious of the well being of the creatures. Tips:1. If you are going solo (like me), go in the afternoon. By this time, the bulk of the visitors have gone already. And the sunset/dusk makes for a picturesque photo.2. I recommend allotting 3-5 hours to maximize your visit. I was walking at a relaxed pace. I gave myself enough time to just sit, observe and take photos of the animals. Plus side of not rushing, when the animals were in hiding, the other visitors would just move on. I, on the other hand, would wait a few moments and they would just appear out of their hiding briefly before retreating again.3. There's water stations everywhere. So make sure to bring your water bottle. There's also a lot of vending machines. You can use cash or an EZ Link card. I don't remember the denominations that the machine accept. But to be safe just make sure you have SGD 2 notes.4. If you are going to do the Rainforest Lumina nightwalk, bring insect repellent spray. If you can withstand the humidity and the warm temperature, wear long bottoms. 5. Please be a responsible visitor. it's really basic but I have to reiterate: Be mindful of your trash, dispose properly, do not tap on the glass or use flash photography and be considerate of the other people around you. If you see anyone disturbing/stressing the animals (flash photography/tapping the glass), please stand up for the animals and call the attention of the park personnel.Other tips:- charge your camera battery (have an extra one with you)- SG is very humid and warm all throughout, especially mid day to afternoon. I brought a cooling aloe vera mist with me.- if you get hungry, there's food available. You can bring your own snacks, I think. But the prices are relatively affordable. Personally, I'd rather buy at the establishment. Because it is also one way of supporting their cause.Hope this was helpful!",08-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:17.592744

planning the trip....
well, i just booked it online..and just had to proceed to the kiosk for the ticket by entering the collection code on the e-ticket. you skip the queue if you made an online booking.
Reached the place at 7:30,got the ticket from the main counter near singapore zoo.
FIRST THINGS FIRST
the first thing you do is go for the CREATURES OF THE NIGHT SHOW. I reached the place at 8:00 and waited for half an hour...I felt it was worth the wait..as the queue for the tram was long.I got the best seat (center)..recommend coming here first for this reason.the right and left corners is to avoid.the show was great...very entertaining if it's your first show of the kind. you see the animals so close...overall very good show..not to miss this one......
WHAT I SAW
Amazing host....got to see lot of funny acts by the animals.....owls..rangoons, hyena, much more...stars of the show: the python and the otters
BE A GOOD GUEST..
no flash photography and parents please watch your kids as the show is all about animals and donot try to touch the animals....
THEN we were guided to the tram at 9:00 which was a wait of 5-10 minutes and this was fine as the crowd was vacating very fast.i enjoyed the tram ride...a guided tour , i recommend you have your headphones handy if you looking forward to any language other than English as the tour was guided in English. there are jacks for other languages in front of your seat.
this is approx 40 minute ride, very exciting...saw a lot of animals...not to miss:malayan tapirs,white lions,bongos, sloth bear, clouded leopard and chamaung..
eventually the walking trails....you could even grab a bite during these walks as the restaurants are in the vicinity....all have to be explored the fishing cat trail, the walaby trail, the east lodge trail and the leopard/lion look out....it's a memorable experience with family....
quick tips:
stock up your snacks as you may be hungry,walking shoes are a must...cheapest and easiest mode to travel is bus....drops you straight to the zoo.....

The feeling of walking in the dark and hearing the lion roar is incredible... a few of the animals were hiding from view, but they are not trained to pose, so it’s the luck of the draw!
I enjoyed the entertainment (fire dancers) before the tours started while eating dinner and although my time was for 8:15, I was able to get on at 7:30. Once the rush of people are through, it is opened up to later reservations.

There was a fire act going on in the restaurant near the entrance, which was accompanied by loud music audible for some distance through the park. I was told that I HAD to take the tram, which was a zoo of humanity and none of whom knew how to disable the flash on their phones (no flash photography allowed). At one point the driver got out and walked the length of the train to tell people no photography. I learned AFTER the tram that there were many quiet a delightful trails, which I highly recommend. It was a hard place to find a corner to enjoy the animals in a quiet dark place. The exhibits and enclosures seemed pretty good in terms of naturalistic settings and decent to the creatures themselves.

Also due to this being at night, it is definitely not an opportunity to take nice and clear pics of animals. However, being surrounded by animals in the dark definitely gave it such a different feel and experience to a normal zoo visit, and which I loved! There is a tram ride which gives you around 40mins whistle stop tour around the zoo where you get to see some of the main animals. There are also designated walking routes designed for specific animal species which you can do at your own pace. Walking in the dark felt like I was actually walking within the wildlife, and not surrounded by cages and exhibits.

If you are interested in wildlife and nature, i highly recommend it. As mentioned at the start, if you're not then you may not enjoy it as much but I still feel it is worth going, as it was a completely different experience to just your regular zoo visit!",04-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:37.000147

The night show was really impressive ---- animals were introduced to us in a very cool and fun way. You can then take a tram ride or / and walk up the different trails to see the animals. Personally I would recommend taking the tram ride --- while it only passed through the major spots in the zoo --- it was a wonderful experience to be able to see the animals at night to get a better picture of what life was like for them. Walking up the trails on foot would depend greatly on luck --- some of the animals might be hiding or sleeping so you might not get to see many of them really.

One note though --- for those who would like to take photos and selfies instead of simply appreciating the animals, you might be disappointed because it's so dark it's impossible to take any photos.

Upon arrival I was recommended to take the walking tracks first, see the show and then the tram and it worked out great.

The walking trails are easy to follow and I found it super exciting to explore the trails and walk around in very low light as it gives a completely new and different experience to previous zoo trips.

It was so cool to see the animals out and about and active, which you don't always get to see in the day. Some of the most exciting things for me to see was the bigger-than-expected hyenas, the tiger, the lion and the otters.

Also a highlight was the Creatures by night show where we got to see many animals up close including a huge monkey and a snake.

After walking around and seeing the show, i took a tram around the zoo which gave a very informative commentary and an additional close up including seeing one of the most beautful elephants I have ever seen.

I'll be going back on my next trip for sure!

I took the train and then a bus to get out to the zoo. In hindsight I should have booked a transfer. I took a taxi home which cost around $20.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:45.354501

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Srdan13,563455185,01-03-2018,4,One of the kind experience but short,"Time flies when you’re having fun - they say, and it’s a perfect summary of my visit to Singapore Zoo during Night Safari.

Good thing to know about Night Safari is that although Google Maps you will find that the park is opening from 1930h (730pm), it actually opens from 1900h (0700pm).
In my opinion it’s better to come earlier than later. The dark settles already at around 1900h so you can be there at 1930h, easily catch night safari via tram and after that you can attend the night show with the creatures of the night. This last bit is important because the last show starts around 2130h so you will miss it if you come later.

Night Safari itself is a great experience and at one moment you’re wondering how come this kind of experience didn’t spread out around the world.
Photography is forbidden with a flash which is understandable. So if you want to take pictures you can forget about cameras on phones because even the latest flag-ship models of smartphones cannot produce even a medium quality picture in near absolute darkness while you’re moving on a tram.

My recommendation is - just relax, enjoy a ride, keep you’re smartphone in your bag, experience the event in the NOW, not waste time recording it so you can experience it later with grainy pictures and lousy recordings.

Night show which comes afterwards is great. Thanks to the great presenter it’s a part Stand up show with animals. You will have a lot of laughs and great time.
Here you will have enough opportunity for pictures, but when in dark you should also disable the flash on your camera so you don’t unnerve the animals.

There are two small remarks which I noted during the show:

At one point female trainer had one animal on its shoulder and volunteer from the crowd was a 10 year boy from Sweden. Anyhow presenter called the animal by it’s name, boy assumed he was talking to the animal, and the presenter noticed this and said he is talking to the beautiful one, not the ugly one, and at time pointing at the female trainer.
Some of the crowd even booed at that moment which was very justified.

Mate you’re are great at presenting and show is great because of your feel for the crowd and sense of your humor. Nevertheless that doesn’t give you the right to be rude and ungentlemanly. So I hope that you apologized to her - because the lady deserves it.

The other thing is that the show is just too short. This is probably done out of necessity and because there are lot of people. To counteract this, in my opinion the only option is to offer a second show at the same time, because it’s obvious that Night Safari as a whole is very popular.

So to conclude this review: I had a great time, it’s truly an experience you will always remember.
Nowhere else you will be so close to the animals like you will during Night Safari.
It’s just incredible, and the price is also reasonable.

Visit with your family or friends and have a great time, but remember - it will be over in a blink of an eye.",03-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:52.929066

I watched the creatures of the night show, which I found to be terrible. It was slow and painful and catered to small children (I'm 30). I may have gotten to see a few animals I couldn't see on the tram, but I really want to leave early but they asked us not to do that since they use the isles to move animals up and down to the stage. The tram did a through job of telling about the animals, their status (endangered vs little threat), and current threats to their survival. I thought the tram was very well done. I did not walk around after the tram because I was too tired. It's hard to do the zoo and night safari in the same day and maximize you're experience, in my opinion.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:53.255438

If you buy a ticket during the day, they will make you choose a date for you to go to the Night Zoo and you will be given a ticket with a time on it. You won't be able to enter the zoo BEFORE the time stamped on your ticket, but you can arrive anytime after it (my ticket had 7:15 pm printed on it but I arrived at 9:00 pm).

Based on other reviews, I went on a Friday night and did the walking trails instead of the actual vehicle safari to avoid lines and crowds. The walking trails were very quiet, and I was able to see many active animals doing things they don't normally do in the day. The key to a good Night Zoo experience is patience. I saw many guests who spent 20 seconds at an exhibit and walked on if it was empty. If you stay and wait, your patience will more often be rewarded than not. Just because I waited while others left the ""empty"" or ""boring"" exhibit - I was able to experience:
- A pride of lions all standing up to stare into the darkness at some far-off quarry, with one on the hill pacing and roaring repeatedly into the night. Hearing a lion's roar while standing alone in the dark was eerie and incredible.
- A hyena emerging from the darkness of the trees on a 15 foot rock/hill in the moonlight, who stared at me and followed me as I left his enclosure area. It was unnerving and amazing all at once.
- A group of 6-10 young river otters playing in the stream in the moonlight, making adorable chattering noises.
- A group of porcupines wandering around, playing, and grooming each other.
- A cloud leopard perched on a branch, alert and listening to all the sounds of the night around him.

I fail to understand why people are giving the Night Zoo trip 5 stars, when they have even make adverse comments. My experience was very disappointing. I found the tram ride disappointing, as many of the animals were hardly visible, (OK it was a night trip, but why?) saying it was a rinforest experience? We passed at least two lots of deer, and two lots of pigs, informed one group was different to the others as they had tusks, which I heard people around me saying I can't see them..
Surely many of the animals were not really night animals, but in enclosures close to the road and by feeding stations. At the end of the tram ride we were ushered into the night show, (unfortunately it started to rain and the show had to be cancelled). Was told there would be a show later. I decided to do the walking trais to at least get something out of the evening, which I will admit was a better way to see the animals, however I did not realise how long it would take to get back to the night show so arrived late was informed it was full and I should have taken my seat by 9pm. There was I believe to be a later show, but as I had arrived by MRT and bus, and the last tram back to Singapore was 11pm, I could not do this. There was no offer of a refund.

I give it 1 star half as the Zoo was open, and half for the fact I did have a slight reduction, as I had travelled by Singapore Airlines, (TIP tell them you travelled with Singapore airlines you will probably only need to give them a flight number, but take your boarding pass in case). I considered the whole experience an over priced tourist trap, would have enjoyed the evening more having a meal in a hawker station.",01-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 15:43:54.705655

It was a unique and exciting experience to visit a zoo at night and see some rare animals.
It appears that there is no cage for most of the animals. Visitors can see animals in a short distance.

Negative:
The zoo was way too overcrowded. I arrived at around 7:30 and had waited for nearly an hour to get on the tram. Then when I finished the ride, it was almost time for the last creatures of the night show. Then after the show, it was already after 10 pm, and I had to catch my pre-booked transfer shuttle. The ticket was expensive, and the location was remote, but I did not get to see much.

The SAEX shuttle bus was total crap. I started waiting at the pickup point outside of my hotel 10 minutes before the said arrival time; the bus never showed up. When I finally called after 30 minutes, I was told that the bus has already gone. I suspect that the bus never took the route advertised on their website.",10-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 15:44:03.060502

I missed the show which I'm sure would have been great, but the plus side was I walked straight onto the tram and had a whole row to myself. This meant I could move easily to see the animals on both sides.

I then went on some of the walking trails and by this time it was about 1045/11pm and very quiet, so it was easy to see the animals. Being alone I did get a little creeped out at times when the path was dark so maybe go with a friend!

The tram ride is very touristy but it was lots of fun!

A suggestion would be to perhaps lower the entry price after the shows are over. It may encourage more guests to come a bit later and ease the crowds.

Also I wish the shop had gifts from the main zoo too- I wanted to buy a red panda toy but they didn't have any :(

After dinner we set out on the night safari, as we were told by friends and others to experience the zoo at night. Well that where it ceased to be, it’s was a beautiful night, cool and calming driving slowly though the enclosures, but the animals were either asleep or at the back of their enclosures. A few deer grazing and a hyena looking at us intently, for food I think, a couple of African pigs, Tiger that was asleep and a lioness that was not interested at all. My choice, the zoo during the day, is your beat option.

2. Make time to attend the two performances- they are ok, not great...but well since you are there.
3. Skip the Trail, and just do the Tram ride - Trails involve a lot of walk (ok for me, may not suit everyone), plus the animals and the habitats you get to see in Tram ride are the best attractions.
4. In the trails since it's night you may not get to see all animals properly. If after the Tram you have time you may choose to walk the Trails at your own casual pace.

Things went downhill from there.

There wasn't any feeding times but the tram is very exclusive. It brings you to see the animals up front and personal within reach but was advised not to touch them.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/bathurstlocal,440313369,27-11-2016,4,Subjective review so YOU decide if you want to go out not. I'm glad I did.,"Well I stopped reading reviews, because I just cannot fathom the stupidity of some people making comments like ""there's moats and wires"" and ""they seemed to force the animals to stay awake..."" Geeze people. It's a zoo. A lot of these animals are dangerous and must be contained, and forcing nocturnal animals to stay awake at night? FFS.

I spent three enjoyable hours at the zoo right next door, then (wasted my time on) the river safari, after which I enjoyed the Amazon River Quest, and finally the night safari (after waiting 1.5 hours on site for the sun to go down!) my feet were killing me at the end.

All these attractions are all side by side, and can be a little confusing (especially the boat part). The food and beverages on site are ridiculously over priced. Bring your own. But of course they understand this, with signs around all the eateries ""no outside food"". Nothing stopping you munching on your fare one you get inside..... $13 for a regular tiger beer! I don't think so.

But on to the actual night safari. Personally I'm a bit torn between caging wild animals for our entertainment; I get this feeling of barbarism, but guilty of contributing to it by going. However, the way these animals are presented is thoughtful. They all seemed content enough, and I do see the tremendous importance of education so we can do what we can to preserve them. The venue certainly promoted preservation and education, and indeed have very successful breeding programs. Can't do better than that, because some they are being successfully are on the endangered list. For these reasons, I support this concept. The staff there are all so happy and helpful, which added to the experience. ESPECIALLY Ogy and her Daughter, who rely went above and beyond. You both are a credit and asset to the N. S. not to mention great ambassadors for all Singaporeans!

I do recommend the attraction, and if you have kids, would say that if you can keep their energy going at this hour, it is a must visit. For adults, hey, it's a night zoo, and there are not a lot of opportunities to see these animals at night, in such a well presented, impeccably clean way. The negative reviews I believe are from visitors with unrealistic expectations.",11-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 15:44:47.593962

Had done the other two zoo areas during the day and came back for this at night. Had bought a ticket in advance and it has a set time and day that you have to be there. Arrived back at the zoo at 7pm for the ticketed time of 7-15 and the lines were huge - did not actually get into the zoo until about 7-45pm. Almost walked off at one stage as wondered if it was worth the wait.
Once inside, decided to walk around rather than take the free train, which everyone else seemed to be lining up for. Felt like I was almost there on my own at some stages. Nice to see the animals at night with the soft lights.
You can walk around most of the zoo and see all the animals better than you can from the train, so would recommend that, but there are some parts that you can only see from the free train. Be aware the train very packed at the start of the night but less crowded as the night progresses.
Overall, am glad that I have seen it but probably would not go again. Saw most of the animals in the day zoo so nothing new at the night zoo, but was cooler and some animals a bit more active in the cool.

Recommend you take the tram and there is a tram stop for you to get off and walk, but don't get off just ride thru the entire tram experience (40 minutes) as there are some animals you can only view on the tram. After the tram ride, take the trails they are all connected so start from one side and be sure to bring a map to maneuver thru the bushes/trees and finish at the end of the other trails.

Animals: A whole variety of interesting creatures to view during the night. I saw animals and their habits that I have never seen before. Truly worthwhile nocturnal experience to see animals that usually would not be visible during the day!

Location: Centre of Singapore, north of the Singapore Botanical Gardens and Central Business District and Orchard Shopping district. Taxi recommended.

Key Takeaway: If you don't mind going slightly away from common Singapore landmarks, this is a recommended visit as the experience is like no other. Recommend going during low-peak periods or later in the evening to avoid crowds or queues.",10-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 15:44:57.034931

You can choose to take the open-sided bus (which they call ""tram"") and go for a 40 minutes ride around the park, or you can walk through the thematic trails. If you have enough time simply do both: first the walking trails (in this way you can avoid the crowd at the tram stop) and then, later on the tram trip to see different sides of the park and also to rest your legs for a while.

Small reminder: it's night, so do not expect to have a clear sight of all the animals and do not expect them to be too active. Take the experience as it is: you are able to walk in the jungle at night without being eaten by some exotic animal.

I strongly suggest to book the tickets in advance online, maybe in combination with the other parks a select the earliest possible slot if you want to enjoy the place and still be able to get back home without spending money on a cab.",08-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 15:45:07.149933

However, be prepared for a lot of queueing and I mean A LOT. The first timed entry is at 7.15pm (buy your tickets by the end of the afternoon as this slot gets sold out quickly), which I went on. I arrived at the Night Safari entrance around 6pm on a Saturday after finishing my Singapore Zoo adventures and a long queue had already formed almost out the door! There was a fire breathing show on by the entrance queue but because of the huge crowds of people and the trees in the way I didn't get to see much of it.

Once I finally got in, I immediately headed to the Creatures of the Night show, which was very cool to watch, but be warned you are not allowed any flash photography as you could damage the vision of some animals. There was a sign saying that this show would be cancelled whenever it rains so if the weather forecast is rain for the evening you plan on coming here, I would recommend choosing another date for your visit. You definitely need to bring some mosquito spray as there are mozzies about waiting to snack on some tasty humans.

Once the show had finished, I had to queue for over an hour to join a tram safari so was a bit exhausted after all the queueing up till then. I was slightly underwhelmed by the safari part as the tram drove by the animals slightly too quickly and I didn't get long to enjoy the sights of the nocturnal animals. There is an option to skip the tram ride and just walk around designated parts of the park at your leisure, which in hindsight I would have probably enjoyed more.

The safari comes with a good cost and as it ends late night reaching city further is will be very late.

The tram is great to get your bearings then it's fairly easy to wander around the four trails.
It's also open till late so a great activity to fill an evening in.
Only two things, firstly, there is no flash photography allowed, so unless you have an amazing low light camera capability, leave it at home, along with your smart phone.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/TorontoJose,385997707,26-06-2016,5,Really cool experience with managed expectations.,"The night zoo is really a neat experience that is 100% worth the visit.

There are a number of paths that you can explore on your own and you can also do a tram tour. Doing both is a must, there are certain animals that you'll only see on the tram and vice versa. Because it's dark out, you can't walk the tram road as you can in the day zoo.

The trail experience was neat, it is remarkably quiet, I swear I was totally alone 70% of the time. However, you have to manage expectations. Because it is night and dimly lit you can't always see the animals well, sometimes not at all.

The tram ride was also awesome. There is absolutely no barrier between you and the animals for many of them which allows for some great viewing.

I'd recommend getting to the Zoo area at 3:00 pm, and first checking out the day zoo. It's a little cooler at that time and gives you three hours to check out the day zoo which is a bit tight but doable. You can then transition over to the Night Zoo which opens at 7:30 pm. The joint ticket is about $65 SD. There is a pretty big line-up that starts up at 7 pm. I'd suggest having some food and drinks until 7:45 pm to let the line dissipate. The line to the trams will be huge still so start by checking out the trails. Once you're done with the trails, say around 9:00 pm, go on a tram. You'll have no line-up. Wait until it's about to leave so you can hopefully sit at the very back in a fully unoccupied row so that you can shift from left to right as need be.

It is a bit tough to get there on transit, sky train + bus which could take from 80 minutes to 2 hours. I'd recommend taking the sky train to Marsilling station and then take a cab from there to cut it down to 40 min. It will set you back about $13 SD each way, cheaper if you share a cab of course.

Food and drinks are crazy expensive so you'll want to budget for that.",06-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 15:45:24.925233

It goes into a defined track and a running commentary in English goes on. There are couple of stops to go into the trails. I went for the whole round and then the trail. There are few trails which are a must go. There is a lot of walking involved so do get your sports shoes on. There are bats and flying squirrels. The walking trails are a must see. Ohh forgot.

It was the tram ride that I truly enjoyed, this went for a decent length of time and was very informative. During the ride I discovered a number of creatures like the lion and rhinoceros that I had thought were exclusively African also existed in Asia, though sadly were endangered.

We did the walking tour first (as the queue for the tram was huge) and took the tram at the end of the night (and practically had it to ourselves). There is lots to see and the enclosures are well laid out. Wear comfortable shoes if you plan on doing the walking tour (which is worth doing) as there is a decent amount of walking involved! The only downside is that this place is hard to get to on public transport and you will almost definitely need to get a taxi back (but there is a well serviced taxi rank outside). Make sure you take a normal taxi rather than one of the 'deluxe' ones or you will get billed a lot more!

I did the tram ride as well as the night show. It was fun and would be great for children and families but being a older I didn't appreciate it the same way I did as a child. I could be wrong regarding this but I felt there were less animals in the zoo this time. I didn't do the wallaby trail coming from Australia and growing up with wallabies in my back yard it didn't particularly interest me and it was getting late but it is possible there are more animals hidden down there.

It was my first day in Singapore and my first ever visit to your beautiful country. I along my brother decided to visit the Night Safari park.

Upon arrival at around 6pm, we were approached by the charismatic Park Manager Mr. Chand who happily informed us that we are selected for a special customer experience. Mr. Chand then very systematically designed our itinerary to suit our convenience, offered us complimentary tickets, applied staff discounts on F&B, presented us a photo frame as a souvenir, reserved our seats at the shows, ushered us through the lines to the front and also arranged a taxi back to our hotel.

I wish we had our families with us as they would be so happy to experience the special customer service. However, I will surely bring them next time we are in Singapore.

Our host, Mr. Chand is an amazing, patient, humble, caring and a great human being. In all honestly, we do not have words to thank him and the park management for such an excellence in customer service. We were delighted to be selected for such an experience that exemplifies your culture of great hospitality.

This is part of the Singapore zoo complex, but a separate attraction only open at night. The three main parts are a tram ride around the park, an animal show and paths you can walk to see the animals closer up. The tram ride lasts about 45 minutes and the show is 30 minutes.

The tram ride brings you around the exhibits showing you different animals at night in their habitats. They use special lighting to simulate moonlight. It was neat to see, though the animals were mostly deer type animals, though there were a few big ones like elephants etc.

The animal show was great. They brought out a bunch of different animals - there were some otters trained to even handle trash. Was quite neat, and my 11 year old daughter like this the most.

You can also walk around the paths and see the animals closer, though we didn't do this.

The cab ride from Orchard rode was about $19 SGD.

Part of a business trip, dinner was to be part of a tour of the Night Safari. Singapore's Night Safari is part of the zoo that opens only at night and featuring nocturnal animals.
Arriving at the zoo, we were ushered into a special waiting area where part rangers introduced us up close and personal to some friendly animals over welcome drinks and canapés.
Next, a specially modified tram that has been transformed into a moving restaurant arrived and my group was ushered on board. Appetizer was served together with your choice of cocktails or wines. While enjoying the starters, we pass through animal exhibits with a ranger narrating through what we are seeing.
For the mains, we stop at a dining station where we were served by a team of chefs. The food was surprisingly good for such a novelty experience. I would suggest that this equals some of the better restaurants I have been to in terms of how delicious the servings was. My menu was pre-selected so I'm not certain if there was any ala carte options. Considering this is a special offering for groups, I hazard a guess that the food has to be pre-determined ahead of time.

Location is slightly far off and one needs to leave a little early.

Night Safari is again initiated by a queue, as usual for any activity in Singapore.

People are taken in open trams through out the area. One also has the option to alight in between and wait for the next trams which follow up regularly.

Lovely animals in dim lighting are visible at close quarters.

Animals like tigers, lion, hippo, hyena, deers, elephants, bear, cheetah, buffaloes, etc are visible clearly.

Photography without flash is allowed.

Tram ride with commentary is about 25 odd minutes.

This is followed by a show of animals from close quarters of python, owls, racoon etc with viewer involvement in the proceedings.

Also a 5 minutes fire dance is out on to reduce the boredom in queue waiting.",10-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 15:48:20.629508

He told us lots of facts about the zoo and about Singapore. Our group of 6 thoroughly enjoyed his banter and jokes. The buffet dinner we were served was surprisingly good. A wide choice of very tasty food. The service in the dining area for drinks etc was faultless. Then Bas led us to our tram, to travel around the zoo. The trip around the zoo took about 45 minutes. The running commentary on the tram was informative and interesting. Obviously the trip was during the night, so some of the animals were a bit hard to see, but i think we saw most of them pretty well.

We did a couple of them, but it was pretty hot and humid, so we made our was back to the exit with about 15 minutes to spare before our due pick up time.

The driver of the tram, (Livanesh) was speeding throughout the whole trip. I was starting to feel uncomfortable about it as we could smell a burnt clutch smell all the way, always jam emergency break whenever he stopped at attraction points, and what made it worse was towards the end as we were along the stretch of road approaching the stop, in order to avoid collision with a parked tram on the side, he swerved the steering wheel abruptly at a fast speed and there happened to be a hump which caused the last two carriages of the tram to sway left and right tremendously as the wheels were lifted from the ground. I am utterly disappointed by how the driver drove as I nearly fell out from the tram if not for my friend holding on to me. Even though there were not many passengers, this is not the right way to drive as there were still kids and a woman carrying a toddler onboard. Such a dangerous act should be condemned.

Unfortunately we had a completely different experience than expected. Even after paying an overpriced ticket, people are expected to wait in huge queues and eat in restaurants that are not that great. The animals are kept right next to all the restaurants, shops, train stops and shows, something that surely bothers them having an acute sense of hearing. While on the trains, no one informs people to keep quiet, so children scream and shout at the poor animals that need their peace and quiet. Other than that, animals are kept in small spaces and look distressed by all the hustle. There is light in all the spaces they are kept, something not normal for them at this time of the night. The first thing I would suggest is the use of earphones on the tour, so it doesn't get as loud and the information is not on speaker.
I believe there should be more space used for the comfort of the animals rather than the tourists. Looks like earning money is more important to them than respecting the animals.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Uktraveller492,681893131,16-06-2019,3,Interesting but very busy,There are two parts to this activity - a ride that takes you round enclosures and then the opportunity to walk on paths taking you past other animals. If you can it’s worth getting priority boarding for the tram ride as it lets you skip the queues which can be very long. The tram does not stop so you don’t have the opportunity to stop and observe those animals and the continual movement makes any photography in dark conditions impractical. Having said that there is a fair chance of seeing some great animals like tapir fairly close up. Just ditch the camera for this part. More interesting are the paths where you can take your time and watch the animals. The high point for me was going into a large enclosure and seeing fruit bats just inches away - with no glass or barrier - eating and active. If you want to observe the animals at leisure the paths are less crowded and much more interesting than the “safari” ride.,06-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 15:48:48.453453

IF I was running the place, I would be selling a small series of night time photos at the end of the trip so that people would be able to take away a memory of each animal in the night time exhibit.

We were collected at our hotel, had an entertaining guide for our approx 45 minute drive to the zoo, and priority at the head of the queue for the tram. The lines to board the trams were horrendous, people must’ve been there for well over an hour at least and were still waiting.
On the tram itself, DON'T sit in the very front seats - much of your view is blocked by the driver.
Views of the animals were pretty good, considering you’re seeing them from a tram at night. The commentary was helpful.
Tip - Don’t waste time & effort trying to take photos unless you’ve got really good camera gear & you know what you’re doing, just put your phone away & enjoy the animals.
However, the nature trails afterwards were the absolute highlight! You have the choice of buying dinner, seeing a show, or walking the trails - I’m so glad we chose the latter!
I had a leg injury from the day before, so I was slow and very careful of my footing, but we did it easily in about an hour. There are four trails, and our guide said each one took about 15 minutes, but they lead into each other, so it was easy to do them all in a circuit.
We got wonderful views of lions, hyenas, fishing cats, cloud leopards, others, porcupines and many more - much better than the view from the tram.
Had a bit of time to spare afterwards to buy food, but we waited and ate back in the city - our bus dropped us off before 11pm, but if I did it again, I’d eat beforehand.
We booked our tour with Viator but there were so many available.
This was my second favourite activity in Singapore, after the Gardens by the Bay.

The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram.

THE GOOD PART:
Up close and personal with the wild animals like lions, we actually saw giraffes, monkeys, zebras, and tigers almost a 100 meters away from our tram. But we are not allowed to touch or be near them even if the other animals come near us.

THE BAD PART:
Before we rode the tram we were told not to do flash photography or make inappropriate noise. The wild animals might be disturbed if they hear us if we make some noise, and prowl unto us. I was so scared and nervous the whole time during the ride, because the other guests inside the tram doesn't follow what the instructor told us to do.They were talking so loud and calling the animals by whistle.

As the tram approached the exhibit the driver would slow down to allow those at the front to get a good long look; for those near the back we stared into bush and trees as the exhibit would not have come into view for us yet. Then, just as those seated at the back finally reached the exhibit viewing opening, the driver sped up and drove off. This was the biggest waste of time and money ever.

In addition, everything felt really staged, as you drive down a single road with a show animals on parade to the left and to the right. I enjoyed the day zoo a whole lot more.

This is a great thing to do, i think that people miss this out and just do the tram but i really think it's worth walking the trail too.

Except for some Aussies responding “here, here…go girl” they did not shut up, nor did the parents attempt to quieten then and, yes, they spoke English.
I would suggest that children be banned from this event after 8pm. If they can’t behave and shut up, they should not be allowed to ruin the experience for everyone else.
The time it takes to do the Tram ride, the Walk on the Wild Side, take in the Creatures of the Night Show and the Fire Show means you should start the experience no later than 5pm, do the Walk first. Sadly, I was with a group and all we had time for was dinner, the Tram ride and, I chose the Creatures of the Night Show which was entertaining and clearly involved much training of the animals participating and included audience participation as well. I had no time for the Fire Show.
There is a huge eating area with a buffet covering every food taste there is – too many choices perhaps! The Zoo is a quarantine area so no pets or plants permitted.
TIP: Singapore’s Zoo is actually quite a drive from downtown where most tourists stay; it is also accessed by the road which leads to Kuala Lumpur so heavy traffic is frequent with the many KL workers returning to their homes – Fridays are the worst.

We arrived at 8:15 and queued for the tram (cars that take you around), which didn’t take too long even though it looked very busy. In the queue, the restaurants and cafes looked really good, but we never got a chance to go to them. We didn’t leave the park until 11:45 and we were busy throughout! So if you fancy some food, I recommend getting there a little earlier and eat before you start.

Once on the tram safari, we listened to information about the animals and got to see a huge array of animals. They were all where you could see them and relatively well-lit but not enough for clear photos, so put your camera phones away and just enjoy the eerie but amazing feeling of being in the wild amongst these animals! Our favourite moment was seeing the wolves howling stood upon a rock! It was like a scene from The Jungle Book!

After the tram part of the tour, you’ll be able to take yourself along the walking route, which is split into 4 parts, but very simple to follow. This part was really nice as you could go at your own pace and read all the information labels that tell you about the animals and their habitats. As it got later, at times we felt alone in the jungle - a really memorable feeling. Staff were positioned mainly to guide you in the right directions, but whenever we spoke to any of them, they knew lots of details about their animals.

This is due to the many people joining and the very short time you have for everything. If you have small children you might have to come at the earliest timeslot - in that case I would urge you to (a) bring water & food and (b) skip the shows at the beginning and go directly for the train (or the walk if your kinds can handle the distances). The shows can be watched afterwards as well when there are less people.
If you have the option to go at the last possible timeslot (which is what we did) it is not that crowded anymore. We went for the fire show (for like 2 minutes), the animal show (which was very well done and interesting) and then we went for the full hike through the park which gives you much more time to see the animals. After that was finished we went for another round through the park with the train (which was already completely empty except for 3 more people in another wagon).

The commentary on the tram ride was really informative but unfortunately some of the animals were too shy to come out; so didn’t get to see many of the night creatures; that is disappointing.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Rachael B,633881916,17-11-2018,2,Timed ticket system needs some work,"The Night Safari itself is a great concept. We really enjoyed seeing the animals a bit more active at night. We thought the lighting had been placed quite strategically by the park and made it a lot easier than expected to view the animals. To get the most out of the park you should get the tram around but also walk each of the trails individually - you see some animals on the trails that you don't see from the tram and vice versa.

However we had an unpleasant experience with the timed ticketing system which makes it hard to leave a positive review. We had bought the 4 park pass with a timed entry for 7:15pm for the Night Safari. The Night Safari opens at 7:15pm so we lined up with everyone else at opening. However shortly after 7pm they started letting people in early, by the time we made it to the front of the queue it was ~7:10pm. The staff member at the gate told us off for arriving early on our timed tickets (even though it was only 5 minutes early and with a long queue it would be difficult to get to the front of the line at 7:15 on the dot), and confiscated our tickets, putting them in a basket with a bunch of other tickets from another group who had the same problem and telling us we needed to wait at the gate until 7:15pm.

When 7:15pm rolled around the staff member started distributing tickets from the basket at random. This was a big problem as we had 4 park tickets and we hadn't used all the parks on our pass yet, so our tickets were still valuable, while a lot of the other tickets in the basket were for people who had other varieties of the multi park ticket / had already visited all the parks on their pass. The staff member gave one of our tickets out to another group of people and we had to go chasing after them to get it back. Even after we explained the problem with the process to her, she didn't seem to comprehend that there were multi-park tickets, or that anyone might want to visit anything other than the Night Safari! Not sure if this is how the process is supposed to work or if the staff just need some more training, but it seemed very odd.",11-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:50:07.896500

However, the animals you see in dark is based on pure luck. They take you in a tram to view the wild nocturnal animals in their natural habitat. And along with it they announce what kind of animals you'll see on which side. It is highly recommended to sit on the right side of the tram. I did not see much animals. Also, the fellow passengers in my tram were noisy which spoils the experience further more. However, the clubbed ticket to zoo, river safari and night safari is always a good deal and it's nearby so you can definitely consider visiting it together as it's a new concept",10-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:50:10.004219

You still need to queue to 'collect' your tickets?!
We arrived at 18:45 hoping to attend the 19:15 but we were disappointed to see this was already sold out, as well as the 20:15. The next available time was 21:15! A long wait with no a/c seating areas available.
Once our scheduled time approached, we again had to queue for the tram. it was mayhem. So we decided to see the animal show - more standing around waiting outside the amphitheatre for over 40 mins for this to open. The show was disappointing. We left early.
We waited in another queue to go on the tram - the queue did move fairly quickly this time but by this point it was after 22:15.
The last straw for me, was the sight of the elephants - they were displaying signs of depression, swaying their heads and moving from side to side. Not great at all.
I really felt for people with small children - all the waiting around would be too much.
My only advise if you did want to go, is to arrive at 5pm (or even earlier) to buy or collect tickets (as it seems to make no difference) and eat there (there were lots of choices) - that way you have a chance to go into the park at 19:15 - maybe do the walking trails first, then try the queue for the tram once you do get in.",08-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:50:53.150278

However, I did not find it really special except that I was walking around in the night and had to look carefully in order to spot the animals in their enclosures. It seemed that most of the animals were either resting or sleeping even though they were supposed to be nocturnal creatures.

We were in the 7:15 time slot, which is easily the busiest. People started lining up at 6:00, and that was just the line to check your ticket before getting in line to have your ticket scanned. Word of advice: there is one line to start with, after a staff member checks the ticket the line splits four ways. When we were there everyone stayed in the same line even though other lines said to enter, which worked out for us because we went in another line and were second in that line instead of being 30 or so people from the front. After entering most people ran to the night show, we rode the tram first and then watched the show after and didn’t have any issues. I recommend also doing the walking trails. The tram takes you to animals you can’t see on the walk, but the walking trails allow you to take your time and walk through some exhibits.

Got there to find we had to do the safari at 9.15 even though the show was at 9.30, the last for the evening, so we didn’t get to see it.
But the safari was an absolute waste of time and money. There were hardly any animals to be seen. Those that were out, a few deers, were in dark shadowy places and almost invisible.
The constant comment by the guide was, “ It appears they aren’t out tonight”
We complained at reception about no information regarding when to see the Creatures of the Night show and their sloppy uninformative website but all that got little response.

Even before the train takes off, the driver or guide won’t say a word about not using flash photography or being considerate to other visitors on the train, like being quiet on the tour.
Me and my friend were sitting in front of the 3 grown up Indian adults who nonstop kept talking while the tour was going on. Even we tell them to tone it down, they didn’t care. ( it’s not about excited kids who tend to talk louder; it’s about rowdy adults who don’t give a flying .... about others and that really should be addressed)
Now, for one, we can’t choose the seats, second we can’t get off the train whenever we want and thirdly there should be a way that your visitors can notify the driver or guide of incidents or inappropriately behaving visitors on the train.
For example the animal show host can come on 5 min earlier and give a very entertaining briefing about do’s and dont’s. at least shes done her part: to tell the public to be considerate!!!!
Like in the train station you guys are not even in the rush to get the trains moving, even there’s a 2hr queue and people are tired of standing. Instead of that, you send Photographers to waste even more time before it takes off!? Why ?",07-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:13.316112

The Night Safari offers to explore the nocturnal animals of the zoo both during a tram ride through the djungle and several trails to walk by oneself, which we found an extraordinary experience seeing the animals so close in almost natural habitats.

A major drawback though is that the Night Safari is heavily overcrowded by Indian and Chinese tourists in large groups being extremely noisy and pushing themselves in front especially before and during the tram ride.

Many zoos have nocturnal exhibits but you are never really able to see the animals very well interacting in their natural habitat. At the night safari, located right next to the Singapore zoo and the river safari, you are able to take a guided train ride through the park to see most of the animal exhibits and learn about all of their history and relevance to Singapore.

After the the train ride, guests are able to head out into the park on multiple different foot paths where you can get closer and see many different species of animals that you are not able to see from the train! This allows you to get up close, take pictures, and watch these beautiful animals for as long as you want. This was my favorite part as you could get closer and actually observe the animals!

Also included in the visit is a show of course! Visitors sit in an outdoor stadium where a couple of handlers bring out multiple different nocturnal animals such as owls, raccoons, hyenas, and all sorts of other fun animals!

You begin with sitting in an open long train/bus and has many 5-6stops.You are not allowed to walk or cross the main lane, you have to walk from inside all small and narrow lanes.You can see many animals from a distance since they are left open in an area.

Buying tickets online will save you a lot of time and money. Asides from the official website, try tour agencies such as Klook which offer discounts.

It is very dark, and flash photography isn't allowed. You won't be able to get great photos, and it will be hard to see some animals, but still it is a worthwhile experience.

Plenty of food and drinks, restaurants etc available if needed. There is no MRT station near the night safari, but there are many buses that will take you to one. The staff are helpful and can advise you on how to return to your hotel via public transport, as taxis/Grab get very expensive at night.

The tram is not worth it as you won't be able to see the animals clearly from the tram. There is also a very long queue for the tram. Simply take the trails. There are many trails, so do take a look at the map and plan beforehand.",06-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:29.200913

What does this have to do with the Night Safari at the Zoo? Read on.

In order to leverage our Bus Pass, we decided to take the HO/HO Bus to the Zoo for the Night Safari. Since the last HO/HO Bus left the zoo at 10pm, we needed to finish our Night Safari by then, this left us with the 7:15 show or 8:15 show. By the time we got around to booking our Night Safari reservation, the 7:15 show was sold out, so we were left with the 8:15 show.

Now its also important to know that the HO/HO bus runs on the hour, so we took the 7pm HO/HO Bus, which takes 45 minutes to get to the zoo and arrived at 7:45pm. There was already a line for the 8:15pm Night Safari, so we got into line and waited a half hour until the gates opened at 8:15pm. Once the gates opened, we proceeded to a Disney-like line and snaked back and forth for another half an hour until we were finally allowed to board the tram at 8:45 for the 45 minute ride.

OK, so the Tram ride was pretty good. Almost all of the animals that were supposed to be out, were out. I think there were two animals we missed, the wolves and a bear, so that was pretty good. Some of the wildlife (deer and cows) are not fenced in and are free to wander right up to the Tram, which is also pretty cool.

So the Tram rides ends at 9:30 and we have to rush back to try and get to the HO/HO Bus. Given the timing of the above schedule, we were not able to take advantage of the walking tours or the shows. So basically we were left with a 45 minute bus ride, to get in line for an hour, to take a 45 minute tram ride and then an hour bus ride back.

Lessons learned, don't combine the HO/HO Bus with the Night Safari. Probably best to take a different form of transportation and go earlier in the day so that you can enjoy the entire zoo in the daylight. It looked like a great zoo and we were only able to see a small part at night, so it might be worth spending the day at the zoo and finishing up with the 7:15pm Night Safari, which I suspect many people did.",05-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:38.997346

It's advisable to take insect repellent! Once you are done with the animal viewing then there are lots of food and drink choices.

The place is extremely well organised, excellent signage, numerous good outlets and shops and instructions blasted through loudspeakers in English re where to line up for entry etc.
We first went to the “Creatures of the Night” show which a female staff member compered, and we really enjoyed it as there was lots of audience interaction and a variety of animals to see. The same however could not be said for the trolley ride to see animals - we saw loads of deer, which I can see at home, in the wild. Yes we saw elephants, and a giraffe, and we went quickly past the tiger enclosure, however the trolley travels quickly and none of the photos I took were clear enough to actually see the animals. I found it rushed, and it lacked variety. Although it was well organised, and a beautiful garden area, I wouldn’t go again at night.",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:47.811414
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/fromsydwithlove,574524658,20-04-2018,2,Not as exciting as we had hoped.,"We were collected from hotel by a shuttle bus service that was half-hour late only to be placed on a coach for an hour out of the city (which we were totally cool with because we were excited for the zoo).

Once we finally arrived we went on a train that took us on a tour of the park - couldn’t really see much as it was pitch black darkness, it felt more like a ride than an actual tour because we hardly could see anything and were asked not to turn on any lights as it might scare the animals - fair call and that would have been perfectly reasonable had their been any animals in sight.

We did see the big white lion and elephants but again, it was very faint as it really was pitch black darkness.

You were given the option to go for a walk around certain parts of the park so we did only to find the main area (and only area) you had to get a little train from back to the main entrance was jam packed with hundreds of people. - this isn’t good when you need to be back on a coach at a certain time.

After we finally arrived back to the entrance we decided to get a bite to eat and 1 smallish sized burger and coke was around $30AUD.

So overall, I’d say save your pennies and go to a day zoo where you can actually see the animals.",12-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:48.132919

The latter closes at around 6:00 PM, just in time for you to cross over to the Night Safari. We had our tickets bought on-line in advance, but there was already a long queue as early as 6:00 PM waiting for the place to open at 7:15 PM! Anyway, the line moves quite fast once the doors of the Night Safari are opened.

Before taking the tram and roaming along indicated trails in the night zoo (namely, the Fishing Cat trail, the Leopard trail, the Wallaby trail, and the East Lodge trail), you might as well go straight to the amphitheater to watch the ""Creatures of the Night"" show first. The venue has limited seats, so try to be there ahead of other visitors. The show lasts for about 25 mins.

Outside the night zoo (near the main entrance) there's another show ... the Thumbuakar Performance featuring fire dancers. In the same area you'll find a chain of restaurants where you can consume dinner before heading back home. You can also drop by the gift shop for a last minute shopping.

To start the ticket pricing is not cheap, we had a 50% voucher which actually was not necessary as to enjoy the discount, you can only visit after 8.00pm. Ironically, all tickets after that time is already at a 50% discounted rate. Thus, although the ticket pricing is inclusive of unlimited tram rides and the shows are free, there was no point as the last show was at 10.30pm.
Am uncertain if it was due to bad luck, but on the night we visited.....all the supposedly nocturnal animals were very highly inactive. All we got to see were deers and more deers, most of the animals were in hiding or just not visible and after awhile it was very straining on the eyes as we have to try and see where the animals may be hiding and if I can be brutally honest.....most looks like rocks.
As for the only show that we caught, I must say that it was relatively exciting as it showed owls and some kind of bear and cats etc.
However, it was already near to closing time after we caught one show, one tram ride and walked the shortest trial (in hope to catch a closer look at the animals).
Perhaps, to truly enjoy this attraction, one must visit during the 7.00pm time slot to fully soak in all the sights, catch all the shows and perhaps at that time the animals will be more lively. However, be prepared to fork out $45 per adult.....which I am not convince at this point is value for money.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:51:57.155546

It feels very Halloween-like to be walking around a zoo-like space in the dark. However, you do get to see some interesting animals. I recommend going a bit later so you get the animals after they have woken up more. There is a tram that goes around and then 4 areas you can walk around. I recommend doing the walking first, then end with the tram. It took us about 1 hr to do the walking part. The tram took forever because we stopped 2 times for 10-15 min the first time and then 20-25 minutes the second time. The first time we were told about a stalled out tram in front but the second time there was no word, which was irritating. However the tram was cool and a good way to end your time there. The fire show was cancelled due to weather and we didn't see the other one.

Furthermore, there were a lot of souvenir shops around and an dining area when you'd feel famished. Food they offered was quite limited but was relatively cheap in a way.

Around 6:30PM or 7PM, there would be a fire dance show to entertain you while waiting for the park to open.

When your schedule is up and there are just too many people queuing for the tram train, you can opt to join their animal live show first or do the walking trail. The tram train queue may be long but apparently when we did decide to join the queue it was fast moving.

First, the shuttle tour that takes you around the zoo is a must-do, which you can know some information or fun fact about animals, and most of the animals are adorable, just remember do not use a flashlight during the tour.

We went to see the show ""Creatures of the night"" after the tour, and it was beyond our expectation, the host of the show, the animals and all the staffs are just amazing, they made the show alive and really entertaining so please see the show if you have time.

Even though it was late but we still decide to walk through the trail a bit, we thought we won't finish it but it was really exciting to walk through all the trail so we finished it at last. And I highly recommend you to walk into some of the trails that you can get really close to animals, maybe it's a bit scary, but it's definitely an unforgettable memory.

To sum up, even though the zoo is a bit far away from city center, but if you have spare time, and you haven't seen any animals for a wild, and you're seeking for some entertainments different from others in center Singapore, then please come here, it may take your whole night, but pretty worth it for us!",01-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 15:52:15.111103

You could take the train hop-on hop-off and walk around the trails when interested or visit a feeding. You could ride the train through the quiet jungle to hear the big carnivores roaring, awesome! 5 stars without a doubt.
However, more recently they have unfortunately turner the park into a money-making-group-site where you must enter the park at a specific slot, so any dinner you want to enjoy in the safari hawker at the entrance must be well scheduled&lucky with the queues. The train is no longer hop-on hop-off but you need to ride it nonstop from start to finish and do whatever walking you want to do separately. Even worse is the fact that nowadays they have installed 50 speakers throughout the train so you must listen to a teenager unenthusiasticly repeat the same jargon (s)he has said 500 times over, and the speakers are set so loud that you will not hear any animals, so it is more like watching TV.. I would still give it 3 stars as it is an amazing place, but I do really hope the management would not listen to a dollar sign consultant but remembers that it is all about the animals and removes these recent ""improvements""..",12-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 15:52:41.303878

The speed at which the cart moves ,most visitors did not even get to really see the animals on both sides, as by the time they heard the announcement and looked we had passed the place and the animal was not visible anymore.

We were not taken past the tiger, which was the highlight of the previous visit.

The animals were literally a metre away and it was lovely to be able to get up close and personal. The entire experience was enjoyable until we watched the Creatures by the Night show which was led by “Yan” (not sure if that is how you spell her name).

For a part of the show, she required an assistant from the crowd and said she would choose the loudest kid. Sure enough many kids tried their loudest voice but it was quite obvious that Yan had her eyes set on this particular girl in the front row. Yan kept looking at this girl to encourage her to participate but the girl didn’t. Yan asked the kids to try their loudest again, only to then say “I have to choose this girl because she is so cute” (her words).

Now I don’t have any kids myself but I found it very concerning that she did not approach the situation with professionalism or equality. With the pressures of today’s society, I personally felt this was ethically wrong as this in unintentionally instilling in children’s minds that looks will get you the furthest. Despite her request for the loudest kid (and there were plenty of them), she ended up choosing a girl who did not participate purely because she was cute.

This was a wise move since the 7:30 tickets were sold out when we arrived at about 7:15. There are two food stalls before you get to the turnstiles. We had pretty good BBQ chicken while we watched the short fire show. We noticed as we were leaving later in the evening that there is a food court after you go through the turnstiles. By the time we made our way through the turnstiles, the tram line was long and the animal show seating was full. The park stays open until midnight so the four of us started walking on the super lush and jungle like, fishing cat trail. Since most park visitors were watching the show or waiting for a tram we had the trail to ourselves. We found if you are quiet, the animals are not afraid and continue to do whatever they were doing before you came upon them. You might have to watch quietly for a minute, but most of the time, the animal would appear. We saw the fishing cat snag a fish, throw it on the bank, then walk behind some bushes to eat it. Hyenas were chomping on and cracking bits of bone from a bone hanging from a tree. The bat cave was unbelievable -- it was set up like a butterfly exhibit with numerous doors and screens to go through and then you are right there with rather large bats flying all around. It was impressive and a bit terrifying! By about 10:30 we finished walking all the trails, jumped on an empty tram and saw a few things we could not see from the trails.

Once pass the ticket gate there is an area for food drinks and souvenirs ... here is where the fun starts... you line up to enter the queues for night safari ( watching the fire show which is entertaining) followed by another long queue..as each little tram/bus is filled...we waited 45 mins

Excitement was building..after the long and patient wait we boarded our tram and entered the night zone.. the voice over continued to ask people to be quiet...

This is where it is challenging.. sshhh and quiet means quiet.. a group of Adults were loud and I mean loud ...scaring the animals away which sadly meant less nocturnal animals to see and limited our experience... left first part of tour feeling a little disappointed.. but the kid in me loved the tram ride...

We then left the tram and went to the show.. this was well done and entertaining...similar to other zoos..

A number of friends had recommended this over day zoo...

I would do night zoo tour once and once only..and go to day zoo next time..

The underlying critique for me is..the tram has very short stops you view both sides of the road.. and eyes don't get enough time to adjust when looking for smaller animals ...that are there or are they???

And some people just won't shut up...

So if your reading this and a loud person please consider others and zip it...

Compared to the old one: you can hop on/off a few stations, and I missed seeing the giraffes by the moonlight, what a sight to see.

Luckily we had pre-booked a tour which involved a pick-up from our Hotel. We were then able to bypass the queues straight on to a tram. There was plenty of room on the tram so there was no problems seeing the animals and taking photos. There were lots of animals to see from the 45 minute ride. We could then walk the trails for further viewing. Unfortunately we missed The Creatures of the Night Show because it was full so I suggest booking a tour that includes a guaranteed seat if you don't want to miss this show.

We started our visit of with a show which is very fun, interactive, and good for children as well. After that we did the safari with the tram. This is very nice since you can sit back and enjoy the ride through the park with an audio in English (or other Asian languages) explaining about the animals and the park. Finally we did the walking tour, which allows you to discover the different night animals in the order you want.

It is a very interesting experience since all the animals who would sleep and lay around during a normal day visit, are now active and walking around. Unless you are a good photographer, don't bother to bring your camera. Since it is not allowed to use the flash and the living environment of the animals is relatively dark, it is very hard/ almost not possible to get a good picture.

It is quite expensive, but definitely worth for this unique experience!",11-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 15:53:00.759559

The trails presented a similar challenge. I hope to visit the zoo during the day in the near future. Another challenge that I had was that I bought two tickets for all the 4 attractions on line to find out when i arrived that three of the activities were not active during the night. Since i was leaving the following day and the tickets were not refundable, i could not use the additional days of the tickets, therefore, I paid for activities i didn't use and almost double the price of the ticket. I wish I could have known the schedule better - perhaps, it was there and didn't looked close enough or it was not there.

I was hesitant at first because I naively wondered how different it would be from a generic zoo. Was I wrong! I was just so excited to see nocturnal animals out and about. Animals I've never seen before we're active and lively in the dim lights of the park. Fishing cats, African hyenas, night birds, pangolins, mouse deer, wild pigs; a whole set of animals you're aware of but haven't seen in a daytime zoo.

If you only plan to go on the tram ride and watch the show, you can give this place a miss since the queues do not make it worth it as the tram queues can take anywhere between 1-2 hours.

The walking trails are spectacular and should not be missed. These also tend to be less crowded, so you can take your time to look for the animals and get good photos. We went on the trails first and the tram right at the end when the queue was much shorter.

Avoid weekends (Friday and Saturday nights) since the crowds get overwhelming. The staff is generally polite, but they tend to get a little flustered due to the number of people visiting. The night safari management could seriously think of ways to limit the excessive crowding.",08-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 15:53:45.488408

- Came around 5pm, and there are already about 100 people queing, but the door not yet open.
- If you have booking code from online tickets, please print the ticket at singapore zoo self print ticket. No queue, and really will save your time.
- Around 5.45pm (I think), they open the entrance door, and people run to the ticket booth. Many people confused about queue line / redeemed ticket, priority, and groups.
- After you get your real ticket, stay around the ice cream shop. Thats the first queue line (line will open at 6.30pm).
- There are 4 lines, 3 for reguler,1 for member/priority. Many people walked on the right side where there is a sign TRAM 4 and 5, its for groups, and ticket with tram express with multi language, extra pay for this. This line also going to Food court.
- Around 6.30pm, queue line open till in front of the jeep, then you have to wait till 7pm.
- 7pm, the Fire man show. If you want to have a good view, queue at 1 line ( left side near jeep) or sitting area at the chicken restaurant beside ticket booth.
- After the fire show, then the night safari finally open.
- After they scanned your ticket, there are 3 options: go left to the walking trail, go straight to the tram queue (the bamboo line), or go right to the animal show.
- queuing tram was not bad, because i was early.
- tram came every 5 or 10 minutes, and each time, 3 tram x 6 or 8 seat and 4 persons each seat. Tram experience was good, although not every animal can be seen. No use to take picture as it is too dark. No flash are allowed. You can only ride 1 time, if you want more, you have to queue again.
- queuing line to the animal show is near the Tram 4 and 5 station. Long queue but not as long as the entrance and tram.
- show was good, and the amphetheathre can fit many people.

At the ticket desk we asked whether there was space on the 21:30 show, we were assured that there was and so we bought tickets. In the queue to enter the park the electronic billboard displayed the timings for the show: 19:30, 20:30, 21:30, and 22:30. Once we got in (queue was under 5 min) we were told rather rudely that the 21:30 show was full. So we asked when we should arrive for the 22:30 and were bluntly told that there was no 22:30 show. We were really disappointed and were met with no sympathy, told that that show was only on certain days, despite the billboard outside showing no information to that end.
The safari was decent but the mood was spoiled by the disappointment.
They offer a tram with an English speaking commentary but the queue was long for that and took up half our time there at the park.

We knew from other reviews that the waiting time to board the tram could be around half an hour but were unprepared for the over one hour queuing time. By the time we boarded I had significant back ache which reduced enjoyment quite considerably. However, have to say that the entire park itself is brilliant, very cleverly planned and set up. The tram ride and commentary was excellent and we were able to see quite a few of the animals in the dim soft light. After the ride we walked all the trails and found the fruit bat enclosure especially fascinating (didn’t know they were so big). Decided not to queue up to watch the Creatures of the Night show as the first scheduled one was already full as we alighted from the tram.

Even though I'm Singaporean, this is truly a magical destination, for adults and children alike... I've enjoyed my trips there (been there at least 5x), and it's always been an area of pride when I recommend it to friends from abroad.

The tram experience has always held an allure... it allows one to sit back and relax, while allowing the relaxing sounds of nature take over, as we adjust our eyes to dim, dark encounters with creatures of the wild (though, usually the docile kind, if you're on the tram ride!)... The guides are knowledgeable, and at times humorous (depending on your luck).

One's journey doesn't end with the tram ride - in fact, it's just the beginning! Walking about on foot allows you to explore deeper into the jungle like vicinity, and to keep company with the predators, like the lions and the tigers. When you venture deeper, you get to come up upon the giraffes, and the hyenas ... each of the animal enclosures are keep brilliantly separate, either by a ditch and stream, or clever fencing of territory using bushes, trees, hedges....

I always keep the animal shows for the last, as it is closer to the entrance/exit.. hence, a truly memorable finale to my experience at the Night Safari.

I've visited several Night Safaris in the region, but none as as well kept at the Singapore Night Safari. Some of the animals in the other night safaris are kept in appalling conditions, look malnutrition and they truly smell real bad.

Hence, this is the one place I'll always recommend to friends from abroad, if it's their first visit to Singapore... and then again, it has impressed so many of them, they just keep visiting whenever they come back.

I didn't get to see the live shows as I could not be bothered lining up and pushing and shoving with everyone else.

I liked the peaceful tram rides with audio guides telling me interesting informative about the animals. It's interesting to note how in different cultures, zebras are believed to have originated as black, then developed white stripes, or vice versa. And that wolves howl in harmony as a sign of camaraderie. However, as there are many things to see, I highly recommend booking earlier time slots like at 7.15pm to not risk missing out anything. Oh, and, definitely visit the enclosed spaces. You'd get to experience animals like bats in close range. This visit was one with my best friend. Very thankful that I got tickets online first because I got it for about SGD~30 whereas my friend got it for 45. Would like to recommend klook for all visitors. Sharing is caring.

Here 80% of the animals are in cages or their sanctuaries and as such felt like a regular zoo.
The tram ride was nice but most zoos do offer tram rides as well.
Most of the animals could not be seen from the trams though so walking is recommended to see them and as such the place should be called a night zoo, not safari.
The fire show at the entrance was great, better than in Hawaii.
The creatures of the night show was very boring. For example, the trainers brought in owls who merely flapped their wings sitting on their arms and left or hyena who just grabbed and dragged a bone for 3 seconds and left.

They are unreliable with scheduling. Got to the park at 7.30pm. after a 50 min ride (said to be 30-40 mins). Had already purchased tickets at Suntech, where we caught the bus. However, we still had to wait in line for another 30+ mins to obtain tickets. Why? We had to join a line that was very very long to gain entry at 8.15pm. The crowd was herded in like cattle. Too many people provided tickets without facilities to cater for such large crowds. We waited for over 35 mins ie 8.50pm when an announcement was made -no further entry until crowds (already inside) had cleared. We walked through at approx 9pm. The night safari show was full (it started at 8.30pm). The crowds waiting to get on the trams to do the night safari were horrendous ....long long wait (again). We had to leave without seeing anything as the last return bus left at 10pm. Advice #2: take a taxi to/from as there will be more flexibility. Be mindful it's quite a distance from the city so this can be costly. Advice #3: Arrive at 7pm (when it opens) or after 8pm ( when crowds were less). It appears the 7.15 or 8.15pm entries are most popular. The park is open to midnight (I believe -check). The food is very expensive - even the ice cream!

The zoo itself was wonderful, though a chaotic entrance, once you make it on to the walking path, it's not too difficult to extricate yourself from the large, loud families. I would recommend doing the walking tour first and finishing your Night Safari on the tram.

The animals were majestic, and it is easy to see why this zoo has such a draw on both locals and tourists. It's a wonderful way of conserving animals and educating people.

In the night safari they throw orange light at the living places of these animals who are not even nocturnal and you try to search where the animal is from the passing bus. At times you are successful but mostly you are not. So you end staring in the dark and seeing nothing.
So, my suggestion would be to use your time better at some other place. Because even the food offered is not so great and tribal dance shown is degraded version of what we see in India. The show covered with animals performance is also just ok.

First of all, the food outside the venue is low compared to the normal standard in Singapore. The meat is of poor quality, especially when considering the price of the food.

The second thing is the Creatures of the Night show. The show itself is ok. But the seating in the amphitheatre is designed in a way, that probably 1/4 to 1/3 of the seats on the outer edges aren't able to see the complete stage.

We paid $60 Singapore / $42 USD for each person. We were picked up at our hotel (the Marriott) at 6pm on a Saturday evening in a small bus and then taken to a larger bus, which then took us to the park. While we probably could have done it cheaper by buying our tickets online (there appears to be discounts), we thought the price was very reasonable as the Night Safari is pretty far from the hotel and the park was extremely crowded. It was therefore nice to have someone handle all this for us and to bypass the crowds since we were with a group. Our entry time was 7:15pm, which allowed us ride the tram through the park at dusk which means it wasn't too dark and we could actually see the animals. After that we walked on the trails which also allows you to see the animals up close. Afterwards, we got icecream and frappes before walking back on the bus.

We were looking forward to watching the fire show at the entrance but, to our disappointment, it was not available during that period we were there and nothing was me mentioned on the website either.

There are some educational exhibits before entering the Night Safari. We arrived about half an hour before the Night Safari opened, yet there was already a queue to enter.

We decided to have dinner at the Bongo Burgers whilst waiting for the crowd to clear instead of joining the queue.

Upon entering, we were unsure if we should take the tram first or watch the show first. The staff advised us to head for the Creatures of the Night show first though we had just missed one. We were the first to queue for this show, this we could select the choicest seats.

Very interesting and entertaining show. A must see if you are at the Night Safari.

After the show, we took the tram and got off at various stops to further explore the walking trails.

The Safari was fun and I enjoyed the tram ride and seeing the animals up close. Since it was raining, there was no evening show and we got to walk one of the trails. This was actually better than a shoe as we got to spend more time looking at the animals.

We did not take the dinner option with our tour as I had hoped to eat before we left for the tour. This didn't happen but it was OK as there is plenty of food on the site.

But this being Singapore, the whole area is well-planned, plotted, laid-out, convenient and clean. You won't even encounter a mosquito here, and unless you go off-trail, you're unlikely to come across any snakes or scary critters. But you will see lots of animals, all carefully kept in sections that resemble their natural habitat. From elephants to lions to deer to wild boars to otters, this is a diverse open-air zoo and you can explore it in comfort by a winding tram with a guide, or get off and walk through the trails. The whole park is lit by special lamps that resemble moonlight so as not to disturb the animals, many of whom are nocturnal, but it's bright enough for visitors to see the animals.
Here are my recommendations:
- Avoid weekends as the crowds can be huge and the lines long. Go on a weekday and go early (the park opens at 7pm)
- Buy your tickets online at the Night Safari website and save yourself the hassle of standing in line and save some money as they give a 10% discount for online purchases
- Do not eat at the park restaurants. The foods is outrageously overpriced and not very good. East before you go and bring some snacks and drinks
- Take the tram first to get a feel of the park and use the free map to know where you are. But do get off and walk as well, because you'll see more and can take your time to explore.
- Make sure you visit the flying fox and bat enclosure, where you can see these amazing huge bats up close, hanging upside down on tree branches and eating fruits. They are fascinating and beautiful.
- If you are visiting during the rainy season, bring an umbrella and good shoes but don't wear a raincoat. With high humidity, you will melt inside anything that is not breathable.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:55:15.049450

With the huge crowds we couldn't get on the tram until 9:30 pm. Since everywhere else we visited in Singapore during the previous week had been very well organized and no long waits, we were left with the definite impression that this park had very poor crowd control and had a policy of highly over booking. Disappointing to pay so much for what was basically a tram tour through a zoo-like park, the only difference being it was nighttime. Not worth the money and very disappointed to have to wait two hours after buying the ticket and standing in lines to board the tram. Management needs to do a MUCH better job of limiting the number of tickets they sell so there are not such long waits.

The buffet option were bland and cold, they charged $45 if you weren't on the tour itself.
The night safari consisted of us riding a ""tram""- 5/6 buggys being pulled along. I had higher expectations and was not prepared to just be taken to the zoo after hours. The leaflet advertised a cage in which animals were all around you.
Most animals were just sitting there which made us question whether they were sedated. Lions are not supposed to just sit there.
We then had to queue for a while to join the night show which was decent.
Overall let down and we paid $94 each. We also did not see any pandas which is advertised on their brochures, apparently you can see them on the river cruise which is in the same location.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:55:33.284147

1.Explore via walking (took abt 1.5hrs)
2. Animal show
3. Tram ride

Exploration via walking
We explored the entire animal attractions with the map.
Its was an interesting walk where we get to see animals never seen before. Its quite an eye opening. You need some luck in order to see all the animals in the safari. The animals may go into hiding and all you can do is to squint your eyes trying to find the animal.

Animal show
As we completed the 'treking', the path brought us back to the starting point and by then it abt 10.15pm. We manage to get to the Animal Show this time round. The show Emcee is jovial and humerous. The contents are definitely educational.

Tram ride
We took the tram ride after the show. The crowds are gone and we get to enjoy the ride in a quieter environment. The tram took us on a journey not accessible by walking which we took earlier. Animals are indeed out in the open. Some of them are really close by; just hanging by the roadside. The guide on the train introduce the animals clearly and fed us with educational info. Its a good way to end the visit after the long walking.

Visiting Night Safari is definitely not a thrilling trip like other attractions. However, it set a different kind of tempo and makes you take a step back to look at the world and enjoy the peace at night. Be patience as one may not always be lucky to see the animals. Be open minded to the educational sharing by the attraction.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:55:34.357157

The zoo itself is very well planned out, with trails you can walk along by yourself or you can take a safari buggy.
We took the safari buggy first of all, and the driver's commentary was excellent. We saw all types of local creatures as well as the expected lions, tigers and hyenas. The fact that there are very few glass cages, and the majority of the animals are free to wander their enclosure, made it a much nicer than your average zoo experience.
Walking around the trails later was also a great experience, hearing the animals and seeing them close up.

If you take the train and bus, it's very cheap, but does take the 1 plus to get there, up to 1 hour and half. The last bus leaves at 12:15 am. The last train ends at 11:45 or so. See the problem. We took the 11:00pm bus, cut the park short, made on train half way into the city. Then the train closes you have to get off and fine a taxi, which isn't hard or expenses just unexpected.

How wrong I was! We bought tickets online for 62dollars which gave entrance to the 4 parks (bird park too). We picked the earliest entrance to the night zoo which was 7.15 so that we had the longest time there. I would recommend this as you really do need the time if you want to do and see everything properly.
The q at the start to get on a tram was long but not unbearable. There's always the option to do the walking tours first and then the tram anyway.
We did tram first which drove us all round the park and had an informative audio guide. Obviously the animals are not all going to be standing there waiting for us to spot them but that said I think we saw most of them in some way or another.
After the tram we went to the creatures of the night show. It was a bit of fun but I don't really agree with using animals for performances. After this we saw the fire show. I was expecting a group of people but it was just one man. That said, he was amazing and had us all squirming as he got a bit too close to the flames!
After the shows we spent the rest of our night walking round the 4 walking trails and trying to spot all the animals.
One thing that could be improved, i know the point in that it's a night zoo and should be dark but some enclosures were so dark could see nothing through the windows at all not even a branch! And also some of the lighting was too dim to read the information provided about the animal.

The benefits of the night safari are that the animals are awake - doing what they naturally do, and it is cool enough to take your time around the zoo.

There us a team that takes you around and it is possible to get off midway to walk around some of the enclosures.

It's a good idea and largely the animals seem at ease. It's not cheap though!",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:56:08.409710
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Jocelynp06,426423389,09-10-2016,5,Book Online to Reserve a Time and Avoid Longer lines,"What I wish we had known in advance was that you can book online and reserve a time slot. If you show up to the zoo (even if you come early), typically the first one to two hour time slots to enter the park are filled up. If you book online however, your time slot is reserved and you can just show up and get in line to enter the zoo for that time slot. And while you are waiting to enter, they have a fun little fire show to keep people of all ages entertained. Also, if you show up and did not buy a ticket online, you will wait for a long time in the zoo ticketing line. Online is quicker and offers a 10% discount too so it is worth it.

As for the Zoo Night safari itself. You can take a tram and tour most everything that way, which i recommend for people who cannot walk alot, the elderly, families with children, or people who want to just sit back and relax and enjoy the view of the animals. Another option is to walk the paths they have set up, which are labeled very well and are super easy to see at night. We had no issues getting around walking. One trick we learned is station #1 Tram will have the lonest line. If you want to get on the tram, go to a different station like #2 or #3 and the line will be very short and you likely will get on the first tram that arrives. As for the widlife, they are amazing, what you see here is second to none. There is no other zoo in the world that I am aware of that has species from basically every continent so you will see things you have never even heard of. And in some places, the smaller animals get to run across the path in front of you.

Pro - they have shows where families and kids can enjoy seeing some small animals upfront and it only lasts about 30 minutes so worth it if you need a break or distration and need to sit down but want some entertainment. And this is free, it is part of the fee you paid to enter the park so no extra charge for the show.

Con- you are not allowed to have flash on your camera, so prepare ahead of time to ensure any cameras or recordings you bring have the proper lighting to take photos. We did not, so i really dont have a ton of pics to share here with this review due to not knowing this ahead of time.

overall, wonderful experience for a group, solo traveler, couples, families, etc. i belive there is something for everyone here",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:56:08.805818

I like the fact that we could choose to walk around the park on our own (on the well laid out trails) or to opt to take the tram (which caters to different language groups). We entered the zoo at about 7pm and manage to do both with time to spare. \

The guide plays an important role - you get the pre-recorded audio but the guide can also talk and bring some fun to it. So again. It's the human touch.
Animals are very relaxed and look like they pose. There are no faces, just a water trench so that made me suspicious as to how these predators are so chilled when there's so much prey just at a stone's throw from them. Anyway, don't wanna make any assumptions.

Unfortunately, the ""night"" concept is really not working. The animals are asleep (rhino, bear, lion, hyenas, etc.) and cannot be seen. Also, when it's too dark you can only see the outline of the animals and with the no-flash rule, you can't really take a picture. I also think the variety of animals are small (they have deer and more deer). The safari also has a portion where you will alight the tram in the middle of the tour then check out other animals while walking (nobody wants to leave because the people are not sure if it's worth the trip and if they can come back and continue the tour). I think it would be better if there is a separate tour for that.

The show afterwards was very underwhelming. The animals were having a mutiny and not following the instructions of the instructor. They showed about six animals, four of them did not do well, one of them is passive (snake), and only one of them succeeded (the otter).

The animal care is not the priority the organisation is solely focused on making money.

Hundreds of people gathered in an overly touristy complex where by people are shuffled into buses and taken around a very strategically build 'safari park' animals have no room to go anywhere or roam free, we were expecting animals to be able to naturally go about there business and we'd stumble across some amazing creatures however food piles were left at the front of their small patch of land in order to ensure animals were in site. Anyone who looked closely could see the electric fences that went round to show they really didn't have room to move.

It was a shame people abused the rule to keep quiet and avoid using flashes on there cameras as it was evidently frightening the animals. We found this to be very disrespectful and make us feel even worse for them.

This goes on from 7pm - 11pm with a constant stream of buses distracting the animals sleeping patterns, which clearly would be distressful for any being whether it be a human or an animal.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:56:43.814883

It is sold ""cheap"" by a couple of $. We could have gone earlier. When you arrive you are directed to an area where there will be ""dancers"" and you can get something to eat or drink. We chose warm overly sweet Singapore Slings. Should have had a cold beer or water.
The dancers were 3 young men. Who twirled fire sticks. They then spent about 20 mins drinking and spraying kerosine, which busty into flame. This is very dramatic, but very unhealthy. Singapore is highly regulated. I am surprised this got past health and safety. I was left breathless from the concentration of kero in the air. I wonder what the ""dancers"" lung capacity will be like when they turn 30.
The train ride thru the animals was great. We did not see everyone but quite a lot.

Much simpler to take an air conditioned taxi and arrive stress free, as you will enjoy the animals all the more, as you are greeted by a frisky bunch of cotton-top Tamarins, who are not shy about being photographed as they play above your head. With so much to see, we allowed all day, and brought the double (and discounted )tickets for the day and the night zoo visit. Throw in the bird park as well, and you get that cheaper as well. However we chose to take the $5 tram ride option to cut down on walking, and this is a great way to get around like a hop on, hop off system to see your favourite animals. Allow for some standing around time, as the queue on the day we were there, (the start of the school holidays!!) the tram rides were at a premium and very popular with family groups There is a great kids zone splash park near stop 2, for refreshments/snacks, but take a change of clothes for the kids/adults who are going to get wet for sure.Or you can slip out the main door, get your hand stamped, and slide into KFC for something to sustain you, then come back in again.
The night zoo was a must for us, but we seriously underestimated the crowd, so start to queue early as the gates open at 7pm.

At the airport we were approached by a salesman and we decided to the buy the tickets for a night safari. He reassured us that we were getting a great deal!
I love animals however I was slightly scared of the possibilities of a lion attacking me or a monkey etc. The man again said there is NOthing to worry about. We took his word for it. The tickets we bought included a mini bus that would take us and others that have got the same deal. The actual night safari, a show which includes different animals AND a little event at the end of the night.
I cant remember the exact price but what I do no is that you NEED to buy tickets at the airport.
We were given our tickets from the airport and told exactly where we had to meet the next day. We were there on time and out driver was ready for you. He couldn't speak English which was a little difficult but it was still a very good ride to the zoo. Three other girls were on the van with us. We all got to no each other well. As we arrived it was EXTREMELY busy. If you are taking kids make sure to hold their hand throughout. We had to go through a couple of queues but it was WELL WORTH IT. We finally got on (all 5 of us) and the journey began .. We saw lions and tigers... All sorts of animals with the instructor informing everyone not to take pictures with flash. I was really scared but it was good scared. The instructor told us about the all animals we pointed out.
After the night safari was over we then went around the zoo and check out snakes and other animals .. We even feed animals.
After this we went to a show .. U get informed what time the show is at. The show was amazing! It is soooo worth it. Really good for kids. Audience get bought to the front and one man had a big snake around him it was really funny.
We were told an animal had escape but it was all part of the fun.

My friend and I did the walking trail first before going on the tram as everyone else rushed for the tram first so it was a long queue. The walking trail is great, as you get to see them up close but you really have to look for the animals as they can be hard to see. The tram will bring you to the other animals up close and real close! Don't worry though, they won't attack. It was about a 40 minutes wait for the tram but if you go on a weekday, I'm sure it won't be as long. But the tram was definitely worth it though.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:57:01.222572

It was one of the most highly rated things to do so we bought tickets online beforehand with promise of efficient entry to a limited number of seats at 8:15pm.

There is just a big mass of people, no separation of the queues leading up to entry and that alone took 45minutes. Add to that people pushing in, little kids touching you while your body sweats away under your limited clothing, and shrieking and crying families. So you wind your way for at least an hour through a snaking queue once someone had taken your ticket to the smell of citronella and at least you have fans blowing on you intermittently.

It was very busy and seemed quite chaotic. Our group was sent to the creatures of the night show 1st, this was about half hour show in which we saw 4/5 animals.
They tried to make it humorous by pretending to have an escaped snake, but you could tell this was very forced. And if you were towards the back you could not really see the animals which were shown.
Our group was then priority boarded on to the tram , this upset a few people in the queue system and they then started to make a scene shouting etc at the staff.
The tram takes 40mins approx to go around but sometimes it's to quick to spot the animals. If you want to see all the animals then you would have to go around twice sitting on both the left and right sides of the tram.
If you can avoid the front row of the 2nd carriage as its directly behind the main tram car and you have the exhaust fumes and heat from it directly in your face.
We left the tram and decided to do the walking trail ""fishing cat"". It was alright walking it until you had to go back to the entrance if you are doubling back on the trail the way back is uphill and quite tiring.

It amazed me how many people ignored the no flash or spotlight rule,it is put in place to protect the animals and guests. so before you go make sure you have a good camera which can take night pictures without a flash, otherwise don't bother taking one.

The program is structured around seeing nocturnal animals in their habitats during their normal active times. The range of animals, and the structure of the habitats are relatively good, as you can get pretty close to many of the animals. While there are a number of other activities like shows, eating, and shopping; the animals are the star of the attraction. The shows are ok, but time is better spent seeing the animals. Coming from another part of the world, there a number of animals native to Asia that I have never had the opportunity to see before.

Recommendation: Do the walking tour first. The night safari has both a tram and a set of walking trails. First the tram lines are long and the wait times are excessive - easily cured by walking. You can see more animals, and can spend more quality time with the exhibts if you walk. If you want to get something to eat, get there with plenty of time in advance to stand in line, order and eat before the night sessions start.

The last part of the zoo can only be seen by riding in the tram. We did this later in the evening - there was no wait.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:57:12.212262

The family we shared the tram with did not take any notice of the polite reminders posted around the zoo that silence is necessary and talked loudly through out the first half of our tram ride.
We got off here to try to avoid the noise. it worked and the second part of the journey was very pleasant. .
This zoo is unique and would have been a great experience if it wasn't for the thoughtlessness of other visitors.
Perhaps the zoo officials could take a harder approach on the noisy visitors. i would not go to zoo again and unfortunately would not recommend the experience.",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:57:12.913281

During the day guests are pretty much able to walk around the exhibits at their own pace, at night it is a much more organised affair with most of the people movement being carried out with a fleet of road trains. First thing to keep in mind is the daytime park and night time park are run as 2 separate items with the day zoo shutting down at about 6 pm and the night zoo not opening till about 7 pm. Once you have your ticket you are held in a very large holding area and while you wait are entertained by a fire eating act - at first sight it has the potential for chaos, with queue jumpers, but that certainly did not happen. A large volume of people are quickly moved and cleverly split into separate lines, they operate a load and depart system many real railways would be proud off, handling several road trains at a time. The train idea is a clever one as it keeps the guests exactly where the staff need them to be and eliminates the potential for human nature to do some silly things which could be quite dangerous for both people and animals alike. As the train meanders its way around the exhibits, there is a useful guided commentary which tells you what is coming up and which side to look., the viewing areas are dimly lit and lunch has been provide for the animals to encourage them into the viewing areas, the system seems to work quite well, although like most daytime zoos there is a percentage of 'No Shows' but this is probably less than if you went during the day when the animals had decided to 'have a little nap!'

Once one enters the park with one’s timed entry ticket, the queue to board the trams was quite long, and there is the obligatory photo stand where you can have your photo taken and the animals are digitally added for a cost. The audio commentary on the trams and the Creatures of the Night Show are entirely geared to children, and I must say that the children present truly enjoyed the trams and the show, and were having a great time.
I would recommend that not riding the trams but rather walking the well-marked trails as you will have a much better chance of seeing the animals. Keep in mind that it is a night time experience, so of necessity, the lighting on the animals is quite low, so if you have poor night vision you will have great difficulty seeing the animals; I have excellent night vision and had difficulty seeing many of the animals myself. Do not bring a camera with you for the Night Safari unless you have a very high end camera with a tripod for taking nighttime photos with no flash as flash photography is not allowed; however, many visitors do use a flash resulting in poor photos and blinding the rest of us on the tours.

This was a safari in Singapore and I thought I might give it a shot. We were pretty close to the animals and there were speakers on. Visitors continued to take pictures with flashes. Weren't these animals supposed to be resting at night?

I couldn't see very clearly how much there was per square foot for each animal but my estimation was that the space wasn't enough. It should be as close to its natural habitat.
Comparing to other Asian animal enclosures, I would say this was fairly good.

I remember the Melbourne Zoo where there was a pride of lions- they could roam around quite freely, quite close to their natural habitat.

The Night Safari was very crowded, the crowds were well managed. As you queued up, there were little built in seats where you could rest instead of standing in queue. We had to queue for 50 minutes for a 40 minute safari that costs 45 Singapore dollars. Was it worthwhile? Yes, it was, but I'll make this a one time visit for myself.

Tip!
1. Definitely buy the ticket with the tram ride - it's worth every penny.
2. Do still walk on all trails - all animals are worth seeing
3. Come on weekends - they let more animals out on weekends. It may be crowded but it's worth it
4. If you see a man feeding the animals and doesn't look like he is flouting the law, do talk to him, he is likely to be the keeper, and the keepers are generally friendly and happy to share little nuggets of information on the safari/animals

The tram ride and animal show were included in the standard ticket, so that was nice. I wish there was more of a raccoon appearance at the show, but overall it was really cute and fun to watch. I felt the ulu ulu restaurant was quite pricey, given it was just a fancier hawker centre.

Walk trails - you can get down at the team station and take a walk trail - it will give you and experience of walking in deep woods.

- wild life show - you get to see some animals in the amphi theatre.

We loved walking the trails and were surprised at the amount of animal activity easily viewable. The tram was also much better than expected. We didn't expect to see animals from the tram, but there they were!

As two adults, we were disappointed in Creatures of the Night and will skip this show on the next visit. Because the earlier shows had filled quickly, we queued for over 45 minutes for the 9:30 show. This was unnecessary as that show had seats available at the start. I wish we had spent extra time walking the trails rather than standing in queue. The show itself was clever and the presenter excellent, but had more jokes and gags than animal activity. If with children, this might provide a nice rest, but we regret not spending more time on the trails. The Fire Show was not running the evening we were there.

I was concerned about transportation for the return. There was no difficulty however. Many taxis arriving and leaving around 11 PM as we finished up.

The staff was great. I appreciated those manning the tram crossing and making sure visitors did not go astray. This is a definite return for next visit.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:57:56.622565

It seemed like a lot of work for the outcome. And it was about $100 for 2 people. Overall, I wasn't that impressed. Just followed the crowd as it's a popular destination.

The way it is designed is a combination of zoo and walking trails. You get on a tram that takes you through various showcasing of selected wild animals like elephant, Tiger, lion etc. It was pleasant enough. However, being the night safari and low lighting for animals, spotting animals was quite difficult. Also most of the herd were Indian species - cows, buffaloes, Tiger etc that I had seen before.

The walking trails are good but not on the days it rains. Then it becomes damp and no animals are visible.

The creatures of the night show is rated as excellent. It's absolutely avoidable. Not only it's making joker out of animals forcefully performing for humans, it disregards it's own rules of harsh lights and loud music.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 15:58:14.613129

This Night Safari is an entire open-air zoo set in a humid tropical forest that is only open at night. This Safari can be explored through Walking Traits or by the Train

We were here on 10th February 2016 and we choose to go by Train. Our Agent has already booked our tickets and our time sought was 7.15 pm. We were told to be at the spot 20 minutes before the given time. As Chinese week was being celebrated, there was huge rush. Big queues were seen. It took more than 30 minutes to sit in the train and start Night Safari exploration.

The animals at the Night Safari, ranged from Indian Rhinoceros, Elephants to Tigers. They are made visible by lighting which resembled moonlight. The lighting is dim enough not to disturb nocturnal and the animals' behaviour. We were also advised not to use flash Cameras.

The journey in the train passing through the forest area was good and we could enjoy every bit of it. Though we have seen these animals in Zoo and in the day time, this is a new experience for us and thrilling too.

Night Safari is one of the main tourist attraction and hence there is crowd at all times. There are many shops and Restaurants in the Safari.

I feel sorry for them having to eat four or more times a night just to have them in position!
The cave walk through with snakes etc sounded exciting and a little dangerous - no, very few exhibits and very fake stone corridors.
Must get a lot of people at times because the queuing lines available are very long. We were lucky to go on a slow night so just ducked under ropes to navigate empty lines.

His knowledge of all the animals and exhibits was fantastic, he explained how the zoo very conservation based & all about education & he even gave us some free toys from the gift store after the tour! The highlight was definitely being able to feed 2 of the elephants - we'd hold out bananas & apples and they'd pluck them from out hands with their trunks!

Anyways, be sure to start queuing up early around 6:45pm as the queue will start to build up fast. There is a fire breathing show on the left of the queue line around 7:15pm so be sure to check that out! When the doors of the park open, instead of heading for the tram ride, I recommend to go for the night safari show instead on the right. After that you can head for the tram as it will be less busy. Be sure to take the tram as there are certain animals you cannot see just by walking. The tram ride itself is maybe 20 minutes long and for certain animal exhibits, there is no barrier between the tram and the animals so some animals are very close to you. After the tram ride, be sure to walk the 3 different trails to see some more animals which you cannot see while on the tram. I managed to see a lion up close through a glass panel.

You can stop in the middle and go around to discover the open space then you can come back to catch their train later on. We missed the two white tigers. I guess they go to bed so early now, no need to hunt at night because they are fed so well now.

The nightmare starts, I queue up at 7:30p.m. for entrance. When I finally step into the park, it was 8:30p.m., then you need to wait for the tram, the whole trip of the tram is about 45 minutes, the tram will bring you to visit different kinds of animals. I spent another hour to wait for the tram. The staff will suggest you to go to the walk trails first then you can come back for shorter queue. Don't trust them, after an hour the queue did not change, and you cannot see the large animals in the walk trails.
Finally, I took the tram and watched a night show. That's it. The time now is 11:15 p.m. You need to spend another hour to wait for the taxi. When I arrived my hotel, the time was 12:30p.m.
If you visit the Singapore zoo, you don't need to visit the Night Safari because the animals are similar. If you really want to see animals at night, I recommend you to visit the Night Zoo at Ching Mai, Thailand. Join the local tour there?
