I say daytime because others who have visited the place say the nighttime light shows are even better. The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex. The flower dome is billed as the largest greenhouse in the world - large it is indeed, and nicely cool as well, and the geographically themed parts of the dome very nice.

The cloud forest was awesome and it was cold there. There is a beautiful indoor waterfall. The types of plant change from broad leaf to coniferous type as you climb up the levels in the dome. There are carnivorous plants for display as well.

The supertrees are so huge and are lit up in the night. The skyway gives a lovely view of the garden and supertrees. There are free light and sound shows at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. at the supertrees everyday.

The Flower Dome was the largest glass greenhouse in the world. According to the guidebook, “it replicates a cool-dry climate featuring plants from the Mediterranean and semi-arid and semi-tropical areas in the world”. There were also beautiful floral Christmas displays throughout.

We went though the domes as fast as we could. The gardens are still amazing, everything is very beautiful.
I recommend not getting tickets with klook in advance because they are for the day you chose and if the weather doesn't allow you to do something, you cannot do the activity some other time or get a refund... The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...
We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.
Another recommendation go there in the afternoon so you can catch the lights, we went around 2pm and finished before sunset, but maybe it was because of the hot weather.",12-2019,,2020-01-17 17:37:28.400844

For me, this visit was enlighting and giving a new perspective that science and technology can make our great nature even more WOW (a.k.a jaw dropping, LOL).
This area is quite huge and perhaps need ""strategy"" so you can use your time wisely and get everything=)
If the weather is good, I suggest you to go around the park first and explore the outdoor area..because the two domes (include the pathways) are totally indoor so no worries with the rain.
All the outdoor area is free to explore..no charge..But for two domes they charge entrance ticket and another charge for observation deck+OCBC skyways.
If you are too tired to walk, the outdoor area can be explored by shuttle car that costs SGD8/1 round trip, but me myself prefered to explore the park on foot. You'll have more time to oberserve and find a lot of photo-shoot spots while walking around. But if you go by shuttle, they provide a recording tape that will give you explanation about the garden. In here, you can see heritage gardens, sun pavilion (cactus) and supertrees while walking around.
After going around the outdoor areas, perhaps you can enter the observation deck and OCBC skyways, because they will close earlier than the domes. But in this visit, I didn't buy the ticket for observation deck & OCBC skyways, so I can't tell you a lot about this..may be next time I'll visit =)
After finished observing the outdoor area, I had lunch first before entering the domes. I would recommend to eat beef & prawn satay at Satay by The Bay. It tastes good, good portion, extra juicy meat and not so expensive. SGD7 for 10 beef satay & SGD2/each prawn satay. The prawn is quite big and juicy. My kids love the prawn very much.. If you don't want to be too full, you can eat with rice cake/""lontong"" (in Malay/Indonesian language) that costs SGD1/small square piece. But if you think you need more carb, maybe better if you just buy rice on other stall and you'll get more by paying the same amount. You can also try water chestnut for the drink, and refreshing tropical fruit for your dessert.
After finished my refreshing lunch, I went to the domes. There are 2 domes, the Flower Domes and the Cloud Forest Dome. I entered the Cloud Forest Dome first...From the first time the entrance door was opened, a huge tall indoor waterfall welcomed me..and it's really a jaw-dropping moment=) I think that is one of the wow-factor of this spot. Perhaps you need to bring jacket, because it's a bit cold inside (even the tap water is cold) and a bit splashy if you take photo near the fall. I was mesmerized by the building structure, how they pump gallons of water all the time to make the man-made waterfall looks alive! and how they use sun panel on the supertree top to make everything works. How smart is the creator of this place!!
This dome is bigger than the Flower Dome..you need to walk on several floors to explore all, but don't worry they have lift too and it is totally accessible for wheel chair and baby stroller. They have waterfall observation deck, the lost world zone (full of mist and you can see carnivore plants), stalagmits collection, orchids, and several unique displays & sculptures from many countries. They even have a lego flowery pond =)
After finished with the Cloud Forest Dome, we went into Flower Dome. There are so many collection of trees and flowers that are arranged to certain theme. The theme will change due to certain period. If the weather is good, you can see the sunset from here too..
The collection of the plants are so many and various and they do alive!! Imagine that many kinds of plants that usually live in different types of habitat can live in one same place.. They put complete explanation on a board in front of every plants. There are several sculpture from stem and roots and they were amazing artwork.
In my visit on January, they were in changing process from Christmas theme to Dahlia (Chinese New Year) theme..The Dahlia will be fully displayed on Jan 17 (if I'm not mistaken). But the existing flower arrangement is still even great for me=) We took several photos in front of the themed garden before leaving this dome.
Then here comes the dinner time.. I chose to eat at Pollen. I recommend you to eat here because it's very near to Supertree..so in case you bring children like me..you know, they eat so slow =) so, if they can't finished their meal before the Supertree Light Show, you can watch while you eat =) There are several restaurants that you can pick here, such as Vietnamese Pho, Japanese, Singaporean chicken/pork rice, Texas fried chicken..at that time I tried the Japanese food and it's so yummy...SGD10-12 for one menu. The portion is quite big, I can not finished myself =) If you want complete menu just add few dollars and you'll have miso soup, 2 slices of watermelon and salad. Bring your tumbler and tap water is free all over the park if you want to save money =)
Then here it is..the closing for this day..the light show...it started on 7.45 p.m and last for around 15min. It great to see the light on supertrees flipping following the music and it's a good photo-shoot spot too with the lighted supertrees behind you..=) you can see the lighted singapore flyer and marina bay sands too from here. In case you missed the show, you can wait for the next show on 8.45 p.m.

Everyone was oohing & aahing as they walked around

Cloud Forest Dome: the minute you walk in and see the waterfall in all its glory.
There are different levels in this dome with different experiences and views of the dome's floral and fauna species
There are great garden sculptures and phenomenal driftwood carved sculptures.
This dome is worth experiencing!

The Super Grove Light Show:
Get there early and claim a place to sit
Many people lay on the concrete beneath the tree structures waiting for the light show
The light show is approx 15 mins long. The lights and lasers are in sync with the music
It was an awesome show and experience. I thoroughly enjoyed it.....Don't miss it!

After the light show there are huge crowds all walking back towards the city.
Get to the Trolley Cart bus quickly and queue for the bus (if you purchased a ticket) Its a quick couple of minute ride instead of walking back in the crowds.",11-2019,,2020-01-17 17:38:03.406351

While there were a lot of people there, we never felt too overwhelmed by a crowd. We loved the Cloud Forest and walking at the top of the Supertrees. The weather was perfect during our visit, so the heat wasn't an issue, though having a layer in the Cloud Forest is a good idea. We also enjoyed lunch in the food court. Like all of Singapore, it's fairly expensive, but we got a discount with our boarding passes from Singapore Air (and there are other ways to get a little bit off the price).

Christmas Wonderland it wasn’t.,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.

We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn’t an option for us.

It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn’t have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.

At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??

We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn’t an option.

Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly’s promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.

After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.

Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.

All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",12-2019,Travelled with family,2020-01-17 17:38:19.302933

This man-made master piece lives up to the the hype and offers a beautiful experience worth the lifetime.

The Musical Light Show is spectacular and if you fail to get a ticket (limited tickets makes it impossible to accommodate everyone so please book it way in advance) to observe it from the viewing deck

The light show takes place twice every night and is on for 15 minutes. The first show is on at 7:45pm and the second is on at 8:45pm. An extra show on Holidays is added, for which you'll have check on their official website (usually a 9.45pm show) .

There are many spots to see this beauty but our favorite (and Highly recommended) was to lie down on the concrete circles supporting the Garden Towers called Super tree Groves an hour prior to the show as they fill-in fast.

Others being:

From above, on the skywalk of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, decent view minus the music

On the promenade by the Dragonfly Lake, at the park entrance between Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay.

The Deck / Skywalk exactly above the public loo overlooking the Super tree Groves (have some steps to climb up)

Other than that there are observatories like Cloud Forest, Flower Forest Dome which are worth the dime.

Numerous sculptures and and arts installed in beautiful corners are worth enjoying.

Restaurants are plenty but standards aren't that great so would suggest to stick to McDs in the Garden.",10-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 17:38:32.926286

I'd definitely say it's worth it and you should go. This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.
The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.
I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out.

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket.",01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 17:39:01.625447

There is NO access to the swimming pool, which is actually what the MBS is famous for, it is only for hotel guests, even hotel guests visitors can not access it.

Save your money and go on the Singapore Flyer (wheel) which is nearby. You will get a much better view of the city, albeit another $10 or $15 more.

So do not waste your money at the Skypark.

Incidentally, we live in Singapore and have stayed at the hotel, the pool is not all it is cracked up to be anyway, my wife has also visited the skypark and said it was a waste of money.
We take all visitors on the Flyer, this is the best way to get a view of Singapore and pick out places of interest to visit later.

Go to Tower 1 and the Ce La Vie desk on the ground level and purchase a ticket for £11 English pounds. Then go up to level 57 and you use your £11 ticket as credit at the bar for drink or food. For an extra £2 we all enjoyed a fabulous cocktail with a much better atmosphere and incredible views. For the same price there were people just walking around a plain observation deck!!!

It costs S$22 pp to gain entrance to the bar / restaurant area at the top but this fee is redeemable against food and drink. A cocktail will set you back around S$23. Food is pricey e.g. S$24 for small plate of prawns. That said, huge numbers of people go there for dinner so clearly popular. Be prepared to have a credit card retained if you’re running a tab. There is a dedicated lift to take you all the way up. You can also pay to gain access to the infinity pool if you want a dip.

The building or 3 towers is just awesome , a real feat of architecture and engineering . The ground floor has two hotel receptions , shops and restaurants & is very busy.

The skypark is at one end and wasn’t that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.

I don’t like heights so was very unnerved by being so high up so had to let my hubby take in the views & take some photos. There is a small cafe selling drinks and a gift shop but there is no where to sit. Clearly they don’t want you to stay up there for for too long. There is a restaurant too but on the day we went it closed at 2 pm

I honestly don’t know how they built this building as it is amazing but don’t expect to see the famous infinity pool as this is only for hotel guests and the skypark is only one end of the top floor so don’t expect to be able to walk around the whole level. The skypark area is surrounded by a tall glass barrier so is safe but you’ve been warned if you don’t like heights think twice, I have never been so scared as I was on this trip.",12-2019,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-17 17:40:18.810409

You can also enjoy a frozen Singapore Sling as you look across the city.
My only negative (and why I have given this 4 and not 5 stars) is that there were no places to sit and there was not much shade and so, although you can spend as long as you like there, it is not comfortable to do so.

We decided to checkout the Skypark on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get a good perspective and overview of this beautiful city. After purchasing our tickets we took the lift to the skypark and were certainly not disappointed with the views of Singapore's skyline and the harbour. We then decided to have something to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the skypark, but were informed that we could not enter the restaurant from the skydeck and would have to leave the skypark via the lift and return to a different level before entering this restaurant. This seemed a little bit odd considering there was an entrance via a couple of stairs from the skydeck. We were also informed that once we left the skypark we would not be able to return. Apparently the operators of the 'Skypark' and the adjacent restaurant were not prepared to co-operate, hence the ludicrous decision to prevent people on the skydeck entering the restaurant.

Unfortunately, we didn't realise that you needed a separate ticket to enter the bar/restaurant. That ticket had to purchassed at ground floor, an dit was too late by the time we were on the top of the building. Lose a start for that.

At this level there is no access to the bar. I would recommend paying extra and go to the bar a level higher where one can relax and enjoy the view with a drink or two specially if it a hot day. Please no not forget when buying ticket to mention that you are a senior citizen if you are. You will get discount and if you flew by Singapore Airline you get further discounts.

To get access to the Skypark you must go to the Sands Hotels. The Skypark ticket office is just by the side of the hotel. While the ticket for the Bar observation area is within the corridor of the hotel. It is fairly easy to find either.

Was it worth it? I think so for the sceneries. Choose a clear day if it is possible.",09-2019,,2020-01-17 17:40:56.580147

Go to tower 3 and as to have a drink at Ce La Vi bar on the 57th floor (skypark is on 56). They charge you 22sgd to go up, but you get a voucher to spend those 22 on drinks. We had a pint of Stella for 21sgd++, which is only slightly more expensive than Clarke Quay for example. The view is fantastic.
