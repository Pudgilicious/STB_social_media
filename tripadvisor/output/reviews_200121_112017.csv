At night time with the light show everywhere you look is amazing and a real buzz around the gardens.

Great place to take the kids as they really enjoy the different lights and colours that are on show.

Personally I think it‚Äôs best to just stay in the free zone area and not go up to see views they are just ok.

I would make this a top priority to see while in Singapore and If time permits would go in daytime and nighttime to see the difference in atmosphere.",01-2020,Travelled solo,2020-01-21 11:20:33.347497

The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.

On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don‚Äôt do refunds üôÑ, sorry but that‚Äôs poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck. üò≥
So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....
Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",01-2020,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 11:20:33.679017

The path are easy to follow and not overly crowded. There are signs identifying each tree or flower. The wood sculptures are unbelievable. The free light show far surpasses going to the Night Safari. The lights dance to the classical music. Get there early for a seat on the steps. Standing and looking up for close to an hour is not comfortable. Hang back or immediately head for the exits as it is very crowded as the area empties. Access to the park is easy from the Bayfront MRT.,01-2020,Travelled as a couple,2020-01-21 11:20:38.286523

The audio bus tour was a bit pricey for what you got and the gardens are a very large space for anyone who has mobility challenges. Any shuttles we saw were not able to pick us up.
Also, we had spent some time there and wanted to have a nice lunch between touring the two main exhibits and we were not able to find a restaurant. We asked every employee we saw and were directed to walk here, walk there, restaurant was closed for special function, more walking, more shuttles that would not assist with a ride, more employees that couldn‚Äôt assist with food directions.
We eventually left with only visiting one of the exhibits, but when we returned the following morning they did honour our ticket from the previous day.
All in all it is a lovely place and I believe they have a nice evening light show which we didn‚Äôt see.

It is a very pleasant place if you need to rest your legs and enjoy the cool and free air-con. So far this is the only art gallery/museum that has left me generally unimpressed. Perhaps better works were not showcased. So my advice is not to pay the hefty entrance fees until better art is displayed in the future. The Visitor Officers were just waiting for me to step across the line so that they can reprimand me in less than a second. I received a more hostile reception than my 6 year old son when he crossed the line to have a closer look at Mona Lisa in the Louvre. This also happened once when I was just reading a plastic plaque whose fonts were too small for my old eyes. Anyway this is the most excellent reflection of the Singapore culture.

As far as the art goes, I must admit I know very little about Asian art and I found many interesting galleries in this collection. I did see the Biennale exhibits and found them enjoyable, especially the interactive ones, though the numerous little short films were exhausting and not many of value.
Don't worry if you don't have any knowledge about what you are about to see, just go with an open mind.

It is a big blunder that my two other friends and I spent all our time in the Supreme Court wing,which made us miss all the interesting things in the City Hall wing.So if you are visiting the gallery and have limited time,please make sure you plan your time well and try to cover different areas,especially if it is your first visit.This will help you have a whole picture of the gallery.Another tip is that since it might take hours to visit it and the air conditioning is pretty powerful,it might be a good idea to to wear long trousers and bring a jacket.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 11:21:15.840680

We had our trip there yesterday for about 3 hours so as to learn more about cultures in Singapore as well as Southeast Asia.

The building used to be the Supreme Court and City Hall. When we arrived there, I was enthralled by its colossal structure with British architecture style. These two buildings are integrated through link bridges and a new basement level. Likewise, the foyer, which was what we first stepped in, was spacious and magnificent with many beautiful decorations on the walls and ceilings.The delicate internal designs of the galleries overwhelmed me: patterned pillars, intricate chandeliers and old-fashioned arches. As for exhibits, they are divided into different galleries based on their themes and time ranges. There are a wide variety of exhibitions such as 'Siapa Nama Kamu?' (which means 'What's Your Name?'). I could feel the various ideologies of people from different times in different exhibitions.

Different artwork expressed different wishes of people. For example, some of the artworks are so abstract that we could not understand the meaning behind them. However, actually the artists just used different materials or elements to imply their thoughts. When I understood the true meanings of the artworks, I felt very surprised and impressed by the artists' abilities in conveying messages. Some artworks look very mysterious yet represent the artists, longing for peace and unity between the different racial groups.

Since the temperature there is quite low, you may need to bring jackets or sweaters in case it is too cold for you. Secondly, food and beverages are not allowed into the galleries. You can put your items like bags in the lockers only with deposit of $1 per locker. Furthermore, visitors are to keep quiet in the galleries so that other visitors will not be disturbed. Most importantly, there are black lines on the floor in front of every artwork that visitors must not go beyond.

Each floor has different kinds of art,such as ink painting, landscape and performance art. They showed the history of Southeast Asian economy and politics.
The gallery divided into different themes and factions. You can find the art that you appreciate and favor.
Children can create their own paintings on the second floor where provided painting rooms for children.
Before you leave the gallery, you can paint a postcard by yourself at the entrance of the gallery with pigments offered.
For I, it is worth visiting the National Gallery because this visit has enriched my knowledge about history and cultivated my taste in art.

When I first saw it. I was astounded. The structure of it which combines the advantages of Chinese and Western architecture was totally marvellous and it even can compare to Buckingham Palace. When I walked inside,thousands of delicate artworks caught my eyes at once.

There are 5 floors in the gallery. Although all of them were great, but I'm still strongly recommend the third floor. Artworks there are mainly about South-east Asian history. Through these oil paintings ,it is as if you are taking a time machine and seeing the stories happen in the past.

The National gallery is really worth a visit. You not only can learn about Asian painting styles,but also learn about the local history.

Remember to wear a jacket if you come here. The air conditioning is super strong.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 11:21:20.840482

It oversees the world‚Äôs largest public collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asia art in order to provide an understanding and appreciation of art and culture through a variety of media.

To be honest, it is worth to pay a visit, especially the exhibition hall on the 3rd and 5th floor. ‚ÄòBetween Declarations and Dreams‚Äô collects some art works like ‚ÄòForest Fire‚Äô , ‚ÄòDancing Mutants‚Äô , ‚ÄòAge of Full Bloom‚Äô . All of these works are less abstract, so it will be easier for you to understand the meanings behind them.

Last but not the least, please make a map of visiting route before setting off and find a guide to go with you if possible. In that way, you will understand the stories behind works easily.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 11:21:21.131793

As a part of our learning journeys to teachers and 18 of us scholars visited the National Gallery of Singapore on the afternoon of November 27, 2019 we spent 2.5 hours inside it to appreciate the artworks on display. It is spacious and contains two wings that are linked and five storeys . We were amazed by the grand buildings and their classical British architecture style ,but it is a pity that we only finished our tour in the former Supreme Court building due to the limited time.

The works of art there are quite interesting and thought-provoking. There are realistic works like ‚Äòthe Violinist‚Äô,‚Äôthe Road Construction Worker‚Äô and so on. These drawings look so real and depict people and objects in detail. There are abstract works as well : ‚ÄòFootstep‚Äô which consists of rubber slippers , ‚ÄòA Non-visual Art which shows nothing on canvas .Though some of them may be confusing, introductions and explanations beside them can help us get a better understanding of them.

Since the gallery opened in 2015, it is the newest museum in Singapore .The environment is pleasant,well-decorated and well-equipped.It was an enjoyable experience for me but the temperature was so low that I felt cold and had to put on a jacket.When we were looking for artworks created in the 21st century the staff there pointed the way and explained the layout of the gallery. When we said we were not clear of the meaning of ‚ÄòI fry you‚Äô,a member of the staff explained the background of it clearly to help us understand . It is definitely worth visiting.

The gallery is really spacious and contains more than 8000 artworks so if you want to appreciate all of them, it may take a whole day .It‚Äôs a good choice to spare enough time to visit it .On top of that, it is very cool inside due to the air-conditioners so you could bring a jacket in case you feel cold.",11-2019,,2020-01-21 11:21:21.410660

My first impression of the place was that it was huge as there were two opposite wings: The Supreme Court Wing and the City Hall wing.
In the Supreme Court wing, I attended the Biennale exhibition where artworks of South East Asian artists were displayed. There were a total of 11 galleries with diverse topics and originality. They helped me a lot in understanding more about The South East Asian culture and history.
In the City Hall wing was the Siapa Nama Kamu? exhibition of Singaporean art since the 19th century. In addition to that, there was City Hall: If walls could talk, a cinematic display where you get to experience the history of Singapore. They were an engaging way to get to know more about Singapore and its history as well as culture. In addition, on the top level was a spectacular view of the city beneath.
Although I am not an art enthusiast, I found the exhibitions very appealing. The staff here are also very friendly. As a student on a class trip, I was approached by a staff who offered me help with my class project, which I was very grateful of.
For those visiting Singapore, this place is a must-go, especially if you want to find out more about Singaporean as well as South East Asian culture. Approximately 3 hours would be ideal for a visit here.",11-2019,,2020-01-21 11:21:25.263985

A beautiful space built in the old City Hall and Supreme Court Buildings. There are many exhibitions, ranging from ancient to modern time of Singapore and South East Asia. I explored various kinds of paintings and sculptures, each having its own beauty. The information provided was helpful, and the staff was also very friendly. On the other hand, the directions and the location of each exhibition on the map was quite confusing. Despite having the map, I still have a hard time getting to the places I wanted. So I suggest that you should take a guided tour if this is your first time here. In conclusion, this is really an enjoyable experience, and I highly recommend you paying a visit.",11-2019,Travelled with friends,2020-01-21 11:21:25.554603

All in all, sorry to all my teachers out there because i lost my original 10/10 review so i figured i would just botch something together and call it a day :))))))))))).

Anyways, few advice is that you should go there with a full stomach because the food can get pretty pricey.
Also, side note, bringing some sort of music along with you if you aren't a art enthusiast, because to the non-enthusiasts like me, it can get pretty tedious having to walk around a gigantic building for 2 hours

The National Gallery, from the outside it is a long huge building, but when we go inside, there are 2 buildings named City Hall and Supreme Court linked together by bridges. There are 5 floors and from the rooftop you can see all over Singapore, especially Marina Bay.

The Gallery is so big that I spent 3 hours visiting entire the space. I was impressed by the variety of artworks and the architecture. You will feel comfortable here because there are many air conditioners and benches in case you are tired. One of the most impressive points here is the behaviors and attitudes of guides and managers, they are very friendly and willing to help me when I need.

Do read about the rules, prohibited things before you enter the National Gallery and make sure you deposit your bag at the reception because it takes much time to discover the Gallery. Moreover, if you want to know more about the artworks there, you also can book a tour guide at the reception üòÅ.
