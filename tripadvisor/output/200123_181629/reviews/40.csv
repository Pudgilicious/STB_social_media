We started from the Marang Trail climbed up ladders to the Mount Fabor Park, a short walk then led to the Henderson Waves which looks like Dragon from some angles. View up there is the greenery down there all the way to the sea and Sentosa island.

Very easy to reach via cab from Vivo City or Harbourfront. No bus or public transport goes all the way upto the park. Cab is the best option. A short climb to the bridge and you are there. Walk, look at the view across of the Sentosa,water, high-rises, greenery all around. I went in the daylight but it looks beautiful when lights come on. Take time to sit, relax with loved ones. The walk to Mt Faber is long. Alternatively you can comedown a stairway onto the road. There is a bus stop right there which can take you to nearest bus depot and MRT.Cabs will be difficult to find.

The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worthy of visiting and walking across, taking in elevated views of Telok Blangah and beyond. That it connects with Mt Faber extends the walk to a visit to another of Singapore's favourite tourist destinations. Visitors can get marvellous city and harbour views from the top of Mt Faber as well as take the cable car across to Sentosa.
Henderson Waves is part of the walkways system in the Southern Ridges, 10km of greenery extending from Labrador Park to Kent Ridge Park, to Hortpark, to Telok Blangah Hill Park, to Mt Faber.

Started our walk at VivoCity Harbourfront MRT station. Follow signs to exit D, Marang Trail, a moderate to challenging 15 minute hike up to Mt Faber. Views are fantastic up there. On the hinterland you can see the city skyline and public housing. On the coastal front, you can see Sentosa and the various islands. Enjoy the scenery! Walk further and you’ll come to The Jewel, a restaurant, as well as Mt Faber cable car station. An easy walk along the footpath. Be careful of traffic. You will then come to a fork (which is actually a loop). Taking the left fork is 700m to Henderson Waves, while the right is 300m.
We took the longer route. Reaching a Danish Seamen Church, we turned right round the loop. Within a few steps, we came to the big sign ‘Henderson Waves’. A beautiful man-made bridge structure. It was very cooling and slightly breezy.
Continuing the walk, you will come to Forest Walk, a metal trail that brings you into the forest canopy. You come very close to nature here, hearing the various birds and insects, plus seeing squirrels. We ended our walk here and returned via the same route after 2.5 hrs. The trail continues further if you wish to walk more.

It is a wooden bridge at a height of 68 meters and has an unusual shape that gives the feeling of waves. Singapore is one of the rare cities where you can enjoy walking through a dense tropical forest right in the middle of the city. A 2.5 kms long tree top walk is one of my favourite activities during every trip to Singapore.
A hour long downpour in the morning had the desired cooling effect and we headed for this trek. It is a thoroughly enjoyable climb that takes you through a forest track and offers spectacular view of the city from the highest point at the Henderson Waves.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-23 18:16:53.324636

We went shopping in Vivocity and then took the cable car up to the Mount Faber station. You then just go down to the road behind the station and head left following the signs for the Henderson Waves. It is well sign posted and a 10 minute slow walk (about 450m). You have to turn right shortly and follow a meandering road downhill. Keep to the path on the right and you'll soon come to a very clear signed entrance to the bridge.
The kids loved running up the sloped sides on the wave sections of the bridge and we spend a good 30 minutes here. At the opposite end there is a path on the left that tales you down the hill through some exercise areas with sit-up tables, pull up bars etc. Eventually you come to a car park and from here we got an Uber cab back to our hotel.

The bridge offers beautiful scenes of greener Singapore uncovered by skyscrapers. I visited Henderson Waves at dusk and lots of locals (couples, families, groups of friends) were hanging out there.

The green foliage of the forest and park area had shielded virtually every man made structure around, some of the tall buildings managed to show themselves though,maybe trying to still score a point for balance.
At this early hour on a weekday, a solitude walk with no one around within a five km radius was exhilarating. The bridge is designed uniquely resembling seven waves rising up and down the deck.
The bridge was made to connect Mt.Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Park a few years ago, the walk is about 1/2 a km and feels like a board walk.

It had started to drizzle a little and I started to walk towards the Mt.Faber park.
From here I could take in a panaromic view of the city, the dense CBD and a rainforest that was slowly opening up through the haze.

The weather was good , not too hot and not raining, and It was a good exercise for everyone!

I think early morning or evening will be a good time to go as it won't be too hot.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-23 18:17:05.359043

Love the concept of the walkway above the trees . Loved the unique design of the walkway and the shelter areas. There were signs regarding Monkeys , but we did not see any. Our walk included the Forest Walk and Canopy Walk and it was a time well spent. It rained during our walk however that did not dampen our spirits and we enjoyed the entire trail.",12-2015,Family,2020-01-23 18:17:10.700182
