We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we’re back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:20:11.473108

Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:20:11.855372

#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.

Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren’t even half full.

The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.

The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.

You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.

I’d also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don’t want to fatigued when visiting.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-28 15:20:12.185690

The park closed at midnight so we couldn’t do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don’t recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it.

There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren’t willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don’t think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times.

Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don’t mind following trails and map guides.
The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.
All the animals were out and about.
A few pacing animals which were concerning.
Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.
The disappointment was that the show’s messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!
Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!

It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat. We didn’t see the shows as we wanted to prioritise seeing the animals as the children were tired.

It’s a zoo that you take a tram ride around at night. Horrendous queues to board the tram even with a booked slot. Kids were boiling and restless while we waited an hour after our 8.15pm booking just to board the tram. Ride took about 45 minutes so less time than the actual queue!! Yes you see some lovely animals but the tram keeps moving so you’ve gotta make the most of that 10 seconds you get to see it! Some enclosures are either empty or the animals are cleverly disguised as trees! I’m sure it’s fun if you’ve never visited a zoo before!!,07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:15.869165

Hardly even stopped at some places so everyone could get a good look at animals (or at least try to see them).....just rushed. The annoying person who (despite a few warnings from staff about flash photography) wasn't dealt with or even spoken to and the sad attempt by staff at appearing to be in control was seen through.....if your going to have rules about what not to do, then mumble warnings when the rest of us get annoyed with those who break them......actually deal with them.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:16.923646

We had tickets to the Lumina thing so went in at 19:30. Tip: just keep going after the bracelets to beat the crowd. We got first dibs on all the activities and it was fun running ahead in the dark with no one else around.

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/tempoeffects,700696446,19-08-2019,1,"Unbelievably crowded, rather underwhelming. Please go to the zoo instead.","I am aghast at the high ratings that the Night Safari receives. In my view it is a gimmick at best, and a travesty at worst. The first thing to understand is that every spot in the Night Safari experience has been designed as a bottleneck. That means that long queues start at the entrance to get in, in the first place, followed by those to get on to the tram, followed by those to watch the ""show"".

The tram rides are meant to suggest that we're going through a jungle at night. But the trams squeek and people make loud sounds of oohs and aahs. Overall, not bad, but dimly lit animals where we're straining to see them is really not my idea of any meaningful.

The show was stunningly bad - it starts out as some discotheque or teenage award show opening would - with strobe lighting, funky music and such - completely unclear why that needs to be the case. The animals come on stage, do their bit for a few seconds - and scurry away. I suppose Night Safari sells as a major highlight the fact that the owls come in on stands with their keepers down the aisles, i.e. near the audience members, and takes great pride in the python being brought up a the big surprise when we're all made to believe a mongoose is on the loose. Seriously?

I also find somewhat offensive the fact that a (extremely skillfully performed, admittedly) fire-twirling show is a highlight for the loooong winding queue at the entrance. I am sorry, what are you saying? That safaris are a feature in countries of Africa which can be cleverly represented by fire-twirling jugglers and acrobats? Oooh, lets set the mood to imagine if this were a safari in Kenya?! Cultural appropriation and stereotyping, anyone?

Very very serious advice: if you can do so, skip the tram and take the walking trails. Imagine going to a zoo and having to wear blindfolds? Can't? Neither can I, so please just skip Night Safari altogether and go to the zoo in the day.

The ONLY saving grace is the Ben and Jerry's ice cream stand outside.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:24.767358

We love the facility and the drama of the night zoo. It's evolved so much over the years and it's the only attraction I proudly bring my overseas guest to (even those who have gone to S.Africa to see the big 5).
On my last visit in July (8:15pm slot) we were still excited to go however, upon being told to move forward to the 8:15pm (by someone who already validated my ticket) I was shouted at by on of the Q - minders whom I flashed my ticket too. He shouted ""Hello?! What's that?!. I was puzzled and told him this is the e-ticket on my mobile phone. He then said, that's not the ticket. I was puzzled and then realized that while I was walking forward, the tickets had scrolled to the Rain forest Lumnia (It was a package - so the RFL ticket was before the NS ticket and we has 6 tickets in total). I told him, oh of course its the correct ticket, it was checked already and it must have moved.... He then replied curtly, I cannot touch your phone. So I showed it to him again. All this despite being checked to enter the 815pm Q earlier. I know he was making sure but, he could have asked nicely or been trained to identify how a packaged e-ticked was displayed.
The other disappointment aspect was all the staff on ground. At least 80% looked and sounded like they did not want to be there.... This was not the attraction I was used to visiting. Smiling and welcoming on ground staff.. waving at the trams as they pass by, all I saw and heard were glum faces, and shouts at everyone (yes it was very crowded) but, shouting at guest to hurry up and move and fill up the tram seats was uncalled for.... it was noisy and unprofessional. They were obviously untrained and stressed. 80% of them would not be fit to work at a Disney resort! We made our way to the East Lodge only to find vending machines... of poor quality... melted and refroze ice cream filled with ice crystals... no water only soft drinks... Then we walked to see the giraffes near the reservoir just by memory of their location as we missed them during our previous visits and saw everything been boarded up. I asked the staff near the tram stop where were they moved to and to my horror and amusement his response was a simple ""Dead. Dead already"". All in all the animals saved the day of the visit.

Buy tickets online for sure if you do come otherwise -
Queue for tickets
Queue to get in
Queue for tram
Can quite easily be 20 mins / 30 mins / 45 mins and you haven’t seen a thing! Tram trip is ok, but you don’t see lots and over in about 25 mins. Queue takes longer than ride. You see more from walking the trails for sure. We did both. Entry tickets are staggered starting at 7.15pm / 8.15pm etc, big needs to change. Once you have entry the tram queue can be massive. If it is when you go don’t bother - walk it!
Can get there on MRT / bus from city but allow lots of time. Good 40 mins to park from MRT station and then time trip back to avoid missing last MRT (around 11.30pm / 11.45pm). Taxis can be difficult to get hold of at end as everybody leaves at same time

Although purchased tickets on internet in advance, need to stand in a long queue to collect tickets. Be careful the ticket’s condition. Moreover, one counter staff rejected my ticket collect request although I waited for long time in a queue while aligning another staff’s indication after my consultation with him. Staff quality depends on each staff, but appreciate if the zoo encourage staffs.

There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm.
However, there are express pass as multi language tram ticket by S$10. When we have this pass, we can enter the zoo immediately even though I have later ticket. I recommend this way if you accept this cost.

<After Enter>
Honestly speaking, hard to see animals since they were hiding or lying on the ground and also darkness when I had been walking around the course.
But, I could see while I have been riding the tram.
My experience which I could see white lions was great for me.
We saw a animal shows, and there were cute animals, so we enjoyed.

We have been to Singapore Zoo before Night Safari. Singapore Zoo was soooo nice, thus we expected Night Safari is also so good as well. Unfortunately we were not so satisfied, but the zoo in the dark is rare experience.

I wish your experience will be nice!!",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:48.404438
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/sgsheep,697820841,11-08-2019,5,Tips to make Night Safari a good experience!,"We are regular visitors to the Singapore zoo - and we have in tow a 2.5 years old. We recently braved a visit to the Night Safari the first time (our last time there were when we were both kids - and we have not returned earlier as it is famous for its crowd). All three of us had a great time.

I was surprised myself.

1) *Find a way to get in the priority queue.* WRS members get priority. Elderly and folks with disabilities are also given priority. If you booked certain tours you are also given priority.

2) *Do NOT take the tram. Do the trails first.* You would have waited in LONG lines 2x (ticketing counter, the queue to enter the park even though there is a timing allocated) after you manage to clear the ticket gate. You will see another long line ahead (where 95% of people head to) for the tram. NO do not join that line. Look at your map - walk to the left and right and start the trails.

3) *Nocturnal animals are mostly SMALL animals.* The majority of the interesting exhibits are along the trails. You will never be able to see an owl or a porcupine on a moving tram 50m away from the little guy in a rainforest at night.

4) *Finding the animals is part of the fun.* This is a zoo, not a circus. Don't expect to easily spot all the animals listed on the map. The flying squirrels live on trees in tropical rainforests - finding something on a rainforest tree at night is definitely not easy. The hyena may decide to hide when you are there. Go with the right expectation and mindset - the keepers are around and they helped us find some animals.

5) *There are many interesting animals that are (as far as I can remember) not in the day zoo.* Things like the babirusa, bongo, hyena, tarsier, porcupine, civets, various cats, flying squirrels, cloud leopard - just to name a few.

6) *Do not leave when everyone is leaving.* We did not watch the show at the end of our visit - because we do not want to leave with the show crowd. There are plenty of cabs around and we managed to get one within 10min in line.

We didn't take the tram, we didn't watch the show - but we didn't feel like we missed anything and we loved it.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:48.706268

We booked through a Tour service and if you don’t want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows. Dress lightly as it is even more humid at the zoo than other areas of Singapore. A terrific experience.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:48.966645

We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:49.265040
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/WiseTreeOwl,695405062,04-08-2019,3,"A good zoo but over hyped, not worth the queuing.","Our expectations were very high for the Night Safari, we had been told by travel agents back home what a unique experience it was and many of the reviews on here really hype it up too.

We found the experience to be quite different in reality.

Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.

We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.

Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.

So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.

The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.

When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:49.518710

We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.

After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:50.052132

After getting our tickets at the kiosk machine, we started to queue. It took us around 45 mins in a humid and boring queue before our turn to ride the tram. Each ride is around 20 mins. We were also unfortunate to have some tourists who didn't understand English sitting behind us who kept talking and talking. The ride was going through a dimly lit trail (I totally understand it as this is night safari). But at many spots we can't even see the animals when the guided announcement was talking about that animal. Bottomline is, I don't recommend this visit. They need many more improvements before it is acceptable attraction, like how to manage a more pleasant queue and waiting time, maybe installing some night vision screens in the tram and spread out the booking timing into 3-4 segments per hour so that all the visitors dont have to cramp in at the same time.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:22:56.576537

So, the walk was nice and we saw a few things but the tram was not possible. The animals at night show was cute, some clever animals there but far too much chatting and not enough animals/information (although what was there was, was good).

I’d say, don’t bother. Just do the zoo in the day, we saw so much more there and did not feel disappointed at all. Such a shame, the night safari is a great concept, but they let way too many people in causing chaos and huge queues, not my idea of a family night out.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:14.644522

The day is filled with too many exciting things that make you want to spend at the zoo the whole day and more and still want more of it. Live animal shows are equally creapy and exciting,10-2018,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:14.903370

It was huge throng there and nobody controlled this. People like crazy animals ran to the huge queue, and after 15-20 minutes they aware that... it's queue to the entrance! First we need to but tickets! Oh my god... Where to find tickets? We asked some manager, she just waved somewhere as if he don't care. Finally we found a ticket counter. $65 ... it's really overpriced.
Then some managers started to drag a queue to different directions, like we are a herd of sheeps. It was really rude, non-professional. Nobody organized the queue, people sometimes just lost they place in queue... so we left without visiting.
People - there are many nice places in the world. You must compete, not just take money",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:20.553742
,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/FellowTraveler81106,687213311,06-07-2019,1,Don’t bother,"We went to the river safari and night safari with our 3 kids under 10 and two grandparents. A number of exhibits on the river safari were closed (all the walk through ones) and the giant pandas which were highly advertised were barely visible. We bought tickets to the amazon river cruise which upon arrival at the start of the ride (a one minute walk from the ticket counter) we were informed it would not go ahead due to the incoming storm. It seems pretty clear when selling the tickets a storm was imminent! We were then told we could not get a refund on the boat ride but could get a credit for the gift store. Upon complaining we were allowed to use it towards food. The river safari was largely fish in tanks with a few varieties of alligator and Turtles thrown in. The manatees were enjoyable.
We were booked on the 7.15pm Night Safari which also included a live show. We went through the gate at 7pm and were told the 7.15pm live show was now full but we could see the 8.15pm after our safari - all good. We then got ushered into an enormous queue which we stood in for 45min with our kids and elderly parents. We finally got into the tour at 7.45pm. The tour was 30min long and underwhelming. Upon finishing the safari we were told the 8.30pm live show was full and we could wait for the 9.30pm show. We could not wait around that long with 3 small kids.
It feel as though the zoo has simply sectioned off parts of the zoo which has enabled them to charge 3 entry fees. The much anticipated night tour was disorganised and extremely underwhelming. Spend your money doing something else.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:20.892373

We took the 45 minute tram ride around the rainforest and also got a ticket to the Creatures of Night Show which is an interactive experience with the animals. Spoiler alert— they walk across the seating area with owls, for example. They’re pretty punctual with timings too.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:21.196439

,1,58,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Banany73,686601910,04-07-2019,4,Busy,We came with our 2 kids (6 and 12). We bought discounted tickets online the same day and weren't able to pick an entry time until we got up to the zoo at 6.30pm. By then the 7.15pm and 8.15pm entry times were gone so we chose 9.15pm. We hadn't realised at the kiosk that we were selecting entry times and thought it was tour times. When we then tried to enter figuring we'd walk some trails first we were surprised to find out we'd have to wait 2 hours. I think they felt sorry for us and our genuine shock so let us in anyway. There was a huge queue for the tram ride and the show was full so we got a stamp on our hands and came out to get some food. Not the best food but ok. We went back in at 8pm and just got a seat at the creatures of the night show as people had already been queuing and everyone coming off the earlier trans heads straight for the show. The show was ok but nothing great. We did some of the trails and the got the tram at 9ish. By this time there was no queue so if you can wait. Most of the animals are on the right hand side so sit there for best views. We got grab there and back S$22 and S$16. Worth it as it only takes 20 mins and no queuing.,07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:21.801274

Not so great any more. Crowded, expensive food, the added cost of taxis to and from, but worst of all the chaos to queue and get on the safari itself. Total chaos and an hour of wasted time. I would not be advising friends to bother. The night is just too hard.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:22.059869

We caught the Tram first and then walked the whole zoo. Not many people seem to walk it so it lets you linger longer at the enclosures with less people. The animal show was worth seeing as well. Unfortunately some animal feeding only happens on weekends. The only thing we found that was disappointing was the food on offer. Not that enjoyable. That aside it's a must visit.,06-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:22.320159

The actual tram loop goes by pretty fast. I think we were only on the tram for about 40-45 mins. The rest of the time we walked 2 of the trails. The trails were good and offered better views of some of the animals.
We caught a bit of the fire show at the end just before closing. People seemed to enjoy it and the performers stayed behind to take pictures with anyone who wanted one.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:22.580731

Fire show was was probably the fantastic! Animal show aimed at young kids as they have animals like owls etc. Theres also a very large crowd and queue to the animal show so you have to be quick to grab a seat.

We took direct bus from Suntec city for SG $12 round trip. Arrived before 8pm. We were luckily to jump right on the tram ride. To my surprise, many animals showed up and my teenage boys enjoyed the whole ride. Then we continued to see 9:15 animal show. After that, we already ran out of time to take walk in the zoo because we had to catch last bus back to city. For the whole night, it was fun for my family and only one to two bug bites.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-28 15:23:23.142620
