We arrived in Singapore late at night and so took the next day to travel by MRT to Mount Faber Park and its cable cars. Just take the MRT to The Harbourfront.

The cable cars go really high up the mountain to a restaurant and some shops and offer some fantastic views both of the docks and waterfront and across to Sentosa and Singapore in the other direction.

From the summit, you get great views of much of the south of Singapore and Sentosa. Often there’s a nice cool breeze!
In my opinion, the best views are seen by turning right on exiting the cable-car station. Follow the road, then the obvious path, with views at various places. Don’t miss the free binoculars, they are powerful and show detail you’ll miss without magnification. In addition to the views, watch out for birds, as well as enjoying the many trees.
Most visitors turn left from the station, and head for the peak. Views in this direction are not as good, and there are too many steps without handrails for my liking. The brown signs show toilets in this direction, and I do remember them, but I think they were closed years ago. I haven’t seen them for ages, and on this visit met somebody else also hunting for them!
The only toilets are at the cable-car station as far as I know. They’re not easy to find. If necessary ask for help.
The disabled will find the summit reasonably flat. There's a lift from the cable-car, and if you go the route I suggest, not many steps.
We’d love to have a meal here. But we go for the peace of the hilltop, and don’t like the music in the restaurants.
Overall, it’s a lovely place to spend an hour or two. However if your time in Singapore is limited, I wouldn’t rate it as a top priority. If you have the time, I’m sure you’ll love it.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 10:22:42.565031

Mount Faber is worth a visit for exercise and is free if you walk. Views back are to the docks and the Sentosa theme park, not the city or Marina Bay. It took us about 90 minutes to walk up from Vivo City and back, taking a detour to cross the Helix Bridge on the way.
Initially we thought we would take the cable car up, but this is only an option if you purchase a ticket that includes entrance to Sentosa Island, minimum SGD$26pp; you cannot buy a Mount Faber only cable car ticket and in our opinion the view from the top is not worth SGD$26 - go to one of the other gardens instead; they are better and free!",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 10:22:48.862691

If you have more time and are not completely out of shape, I highly recommend getting yourself to the beginning of the Southern Ridges, to the bus stop near Alexandra and Depot roads and make a nice walking, or running, trip to combine all the interesting sights between the Southern Ridges and the VivoCity mall.

Nothing much to see. But it is also a gateway over to the resort style island of Singapore, Sentosa Island. Mount Faber is located on the south side of Singapore, and forms a perfect line past the Singapore Cruise terminal and Sentosa Island.
At the top of Mount Faber, it’s great to take a few pictures, and when you are done you can take the cable-car ride to the SENTOSA Island. Nothing spectacular.",10-2016,Solo,2020-01-31 10:23:26.097406

The view at the top of Faber Point, the highest point of the park, was simply stunning and offered a wonderfully picturesque view of Harbourfront and Sentosa.

There is plenty of gorgeous greenery and wildlife such as monkeys to explore along the way (I managed to get a good photo of a cute squirrel). Do make sure to bring some mosquito spray with you as unfortunately they are part of the wildlife as well! Drinking fountains are available along the hiking trail if you want to fill up your water bottle or you forgot to bring one in the first place and need to quench your thirst.

On my walk, I passed through the artistic Henderson Waves bridge, which is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore (274m in length and 36m above ground). There were plenty of benches here to relax and rest my feet for a while. Further along, there is an awesome forest walk where you can admire the lush green scenery below and around you. Alexandra Arch, located just before Hort Park, has an interesting shape just like an open leaf. I definitely recommend the journey from Mount Faber to Hort Park for nature lovers! :)",06-2016,Solo,2020-01-31 10:23:26.847022

Don't forget to buy cable car tickets if you are planning to visit Sentosa. You will be getting a round trip ticket in about SGD 30 which will allow you to board any station in the route and come back to that point. I prefer to board cable car at Mount Faber so that I can end my journey back at this point and then take MRT for the city.

The view from the cable car was breath-taking and it was even more fun due to drizzle. At Mount Faber station, you can walk in the park and be with nature for some time. I and my business partner visited a cafe/bar (I forgot the name) and enjoyed our beers for couple of hours.

Conclusion - It is a relaxing trip. Must-visit sort of place

At this cafe here, I could enjoy the view, so scenic, picture perfect. I had my usual cup of coffee, my colleague had a piece of cheese cake, which looked delicious.

Before going on the cable car to get back to the lower ground, I was tempted with those cute souvenirs, and so bought some to take home.
