The skewers are small, our family of four, including a teenage boy ate 100, this consisted of 10 prawn (devine!!!), 45 chicken and 45 beef. We also purchased some Bok Choy from another vendor, this was delicious.

We were in Singapore nearly 30yrs ago and went to the Satay Solo Club, this is no longer there and it appears this (Satay Club) has replaced it.

Enjoy!",01-2020,Family,2020-01-31 10:25:09.451055

We ordered the $26 set (10 chicken, 10 beef, 5 prawns)

Food arrived at our table within about 10-12 mins, and tasted glorious!

,1,66,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/holl3411,673888038,14-05-2019,3,OK but not what it used to be.,"Visited one evening with 2 kids after having visited Satay Street over 15 years previously. Initially we didn’t get off to a good start as the taxi driver somehow didn’t know where Satay Street actually was (he dropped us off in Chinatown rather than on Boon Tat Street.) Eventually we found the right location (Watch out - not all sat navs have Satay street listed.) We then made the mistake of being led to a table and having a menu thrust upon us, when really we should have seated ourselves and chosen the stall we preferred.

We ordered a mixed satay (chicken, beef and prawn) and mixed steamed veg. The food was good, although seemed to be more prawn than anything else, pricing however was akin to restaurant pricing, which was dissapointing.

One bit of advice is to take your own napkins or wet wipes, or buy them from the 7-Eleven next to the seating area. Street sellers go up and down the tables selling wet wipes and are very good at appearing over your shoulder to push very overpriced wet wipe packs, just at the point when you are covered in Satay!

Unfortunately (as is often the case with kids and lots of soft drinks,) we had to find a toilet part way through the meal. We were pointed towards the market toilets which were an experience in themselves - not one for people with a sensitive sense of smell and they don’t help your appetite!

There is a good feel to the place with the sound and smells, surrounded by the skyscrapers of the CBD, but it’s not as good as it used to be.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-31 10:25:11.353325

What to expect:
- a large hawker centre and the satay street to the side

- $26 for 26 sticks on a set menu from where we ate
- beer girls who come to ur table, tip walk 20m to the 7/11 on satay street (directly in front of 7 and 8) and buy it for half price and twice the freshness.

If you want a good satay this is the place to go, stall 8 proclaim themselves as the best and I couldn't really fault them, so much so that my daughter asked to go back for dinner another night before we left Singapore.

Prices and quality are mostly consistent with each other, really comes down to your preference on the satay sauce more than anything. So don't be afraid to try the other stalls. Recommend buying drinks from the 7 Eleven close by, napkins too if you'd like, although they aren't that much cheaper than the sellers going around.

We would enjoy a beer or two before ordering, just taking in the atmosphere. Several restaurants/stalls will bring menus when you sit down. Don't worry though, you can order from anyone, or find food inside and bring it back to your table. They'll hassle you for a bit if you don't order, but eventually they'll leave you alone. Tables are for any stall/restaurant. We usually did a half order from Stall 7&8, combining that with stir fried rice from a stall inside. Our last night we just ordering a couple prawns and chicken satays with a nice shrimp noodle dish. (from inside) Tiger beer is fairly cheap here, and if you can get a smile from the older lady serving you’re doing well.

We sought out stalls 7 & 8 which came highly recommended. They had no space for us outside their stall but led us up a small staircase to a table in front of the beer stall (happy days!). We placed our food order and then sat with our jug of beer soaking up the atmosphere. I don't know if it was a case of out of sight out of mind but our food did not turn up. Initially we did not query it because we were unsure on waiting times but finally it became obvious there was a problem. I went back to the stall and they had clearly forgotten about us, we then had to wait a while longer for our food.
The food itself was tasty. (Top tip, don't dismiss the lady who approaches your table selling wet wipes. No napkins and eating with your fingers - why didn't I just pay the lady that dollar!!)

There is a large covered hawker center where you can get all type of foods, but the satays are outside so make sure you don't eat inside without seeing the outdoor action
.
When we entered the inside section, there were people trying to get you to sit at a particular table. Just keep walking and when you get to satays, they will help you.
We ate at the 7 and 8 stalls and the people were very helpful in getting a table and explaining the menu. The menu is all satay...combinations of chicken, beef/mutton, and prawns. They were all tasty + peanut sauce was good.

If you want additional non-satay items, you can get served at the outside tables +
drink-lady tigers are on the prowl to get you beverages.

It is easy to get to by taxi, grab or uber (uber is going to be gone in the near future, so download grab before you go --- it is works the same as uber and is easy to use.)

I was introduced to the food stalls here by a Singaporean colleague something like 18 years ago and have come very visit since. My favourite staff was Fatman’s, (No.1) sadly no longer there.

In essence, it is a row of around 12-14 (I never count) Satay stalls, each does slightly differently as they have different proprietors. You can also get food from inside La Pa Sat itself (a greater variety) or binge on Satay and a jug of beer (which I do, I have to admit). The stalls have to vie for business as they are competing with similar “products” on all sides of them. It is not cheap (A jug of beer is about $17, or £9.50 in post Brexit money) That’s good value by central Singapore standards. It is close to the financial district (right over the road from many Banking offices) so probably does price suffer just like the facilities around any Banking area do anywhere in the world and certainly Satay in Malaysia is cheaper, but not so handy if you’re sitting in the centre of a different country.

The minute we sat down, three different touts literally threw their menus on our table. We gave the menus back because we wanted to try specific stalls recommended in the reviews on this site, and a minute later, two of them came back and did it again. We ordered from four different stalls as we were curious about whether was a difference in quality. Turns out they were all uniformly bad. The satay sticks were tiny and flavourless, with the beef and mutton in particular being tough and chewy. The satay sauces from all four stalls were bland. The prawn satays were mealy. The food took ages to arrive and the Tiger Beer lady took so long, we thought she'd forgotten our order. Honestly, don't waste your time. There are much better satays to be had in Sinagpore. If you're going to come here, eat inside at the wonderful Lau Pa Sat hawker centre. I gave it one star because the atmosphere was okay.",07-2018,Friends,2020-01-31 10:27:37.224882

I usually order the chicken satay, as I find the price of the grilled prawns rather overpriced. Most shops would bring you the satay to your table, but for the popular ones, you have to queue up and wait for the satay to be cooked for you.

Overall, it is a good experience to sit in the middle of the Central Business District of Singapore, having grilled meat and beer.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-31 10:27:43.574530

Open at night only, Satay Street is literally a street in the business district which gets closed off after hours. It is attached to Lau Pa Sat. There are numerous satay stalls on the street, so you can take your pick. I went with a local and her view is that they are all similar.

We ate a mixed platter of pork, chicken, beef and prawns. We also ordered some murtabak from another vendor. It was really delicious.

We thought the satays were good though as many have commented a little up there in price but not out priced.

Next door is a Hawkers market with a large variety of different food.

The price of these ""deals"" is shockingly high, on wanting to just stroll the street to look and make our own decision it was just an awful experience of being constantly harrarsed by people trying to get you to sit in their area.

It is a regular street outside the Lau Pa Sat food Centre, that is closed to traffic after 7:00 pm. Like has been said, the satay is good, but better might be found elsewhere, the reason to go there is the atmosphere. It's like a street party. Stall 7 & 8 are frequently mentioned, we did not try anyone else so can't say definitively if they were the best, but they were good enough. I felt the chicken was a tad dry. It can be a little intimidating, to arrive at Satay street and immediately be accosted by the numerous stall representatives urging you to try their food. If you decide before hand which stall you want to patronize, it is helpful to wave the others off. What was interesting this time is that each stall seemed to have their little territory that you needed to sit in in order to order from them. We experienced one cautionary incident in which another stall representative selling roti and mee goreng brought the wrong order and attempted to charge a big price for it. And their noodles were judged as mediocre. People go there for the satay, the other food is a question mark.",04-2017,Friends,2020-01-31 10:27:46.136024
