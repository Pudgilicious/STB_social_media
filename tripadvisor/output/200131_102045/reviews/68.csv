,1,68,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Nancy Y,583528364,29-05-2018,5,Visit East Coast Road if you love food,"Foreigners visiting Singapore may want to drop by East Coast Road. Along the short stretch of road (maybe 800m), you will find all types of cuisine - all neatly lined up in restaurants/cafes along the road. Plus in 112 Katong Mall - situated on same road (just cross the road).

For local food, visit
i. Alibabar Coffee Shop
You must try Fried Hokkien Noodles. A small size plate costs only S$5. We enjoyed it so much my partner (from UK) ordered another plate after his fish and chips! The fish and chips was really yummy too. Fried just right - not oily, or soggy. The black pepper chicken chop was great too. I think no more than S$15/dish. Needless to say, we over ate.

ii. 328 Katong Laksa
Short strands of white noodles (locally referred to as bee hoon) with bits of prawns and thin strands of fish cake cooked in coconut, lemon grass, prawn paste - a rich broth, cooked just right. For me it wasn't that spicy. So they gave a packet of chilli sauce. A small bowl costs about S$4.70.

My suggestion is to order small size ones so that you can sample these local food which are really amongst the best in Singapore. They are located within walking distance hence making it convenient and time-saving.

Take note that Singapore restaurants close early, on average about
9-10 pm. Last order is likely to be more than half hour earlier.

Service is average. Don't expect top notch service excellence. Just be grateful you are served (yes, I am being honestly sarcastic).",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-31 10:40:23.917274

We see more cleaner in the hawker centre it was so pleasant.
However it did not last. The cleaner keep changing every few month and the place become very dirty with paper, chopsticks wraper all over the floor and many myna eating the left over.
No doubt the bird flu is away we should still keep this birds away, we have very short memory. Until something happen we start to panic again.
There might be an issue between the contractor and the cleaner, either don't treat them well or pay them less the worker don't seem to work long keep seeing new cleaner all the time. Sigh......",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 10:40:25.399340

You can't miss the bright red building that was established in 1925. It was one of the first bakeries known as Katong Bakery & Confectionery. Look out for Rumah Bebe. Admire the Peranakan architecture. Turn into Koon Seng Rd for a row of brightly coloured terrace houses. Don't miss some of the ornate facade. Selfie addicts love this place.

The BBQ was cooked by the kids at the table, the meat and vegetables were matched by the sauces and kimchee - it was a perfect meal....I think my favourite was the chicken thighs cooked with kimchee.

Recommend this Joo Chiat Rd, Haig Rd, Tanjong Rd and East Coast Rd for something different - I'm sure you will find a local restaurant to suit.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 10:41:35.068639
