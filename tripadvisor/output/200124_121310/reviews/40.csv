We started from the Marang Trail climbed up ladders to the Mount Fabor Park, a short walk then led to the Henderson Waves which looks like Dragon from some angles. View up there is the greenery down there all the way to the sea and Sentosa island.

Very easy to reach via cab from Vivo City or Harbourfront. No bus or public transport goes all the way upto the park. Cab is the best option. A short climb to the bridge and you are there. Walk, look at the view across of the Sentosa,water, high-rises, greenery all around. I went in the daylight but it looks beautiful when lights come on. Take time to sit, relax with loved ones. The walk to Mt Faber is long. Alternatively you can comedown a stairway onto the road. There is a bus stop right there which can take you to nearest bus depot and MRT.Cabs will be difficult to find.

The highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore is worthy of visiting and walking across, taking in elevated views of Telok Blangah and beyond. That it connects with Mt Faber extends the walk to a visit to another of Singapore's favourite tourist destinations. Visitors can get marvellous city and harbour views from the top of Mt Faber as well as take the cable car across to Sentosa.
Henderson Waves is part of the walkways system in the Southern Ridges, 10km of greenery extending from Labrador Park to Kent Ridge Park, to Hortpark, to Telok Blangah Hill Park, to Mt Faber.

Started our walk at VivoCity Harbourfront MRT station. Follow signs to exit D, Marang Trail, a moderate to challenging 15 minute hike up to Mt Faber. Views are fantastic up there. On the hinterland you can see the city skyline and public housing. On the coastal front, you can see Sentosa and the various islands. Enjoy the scenery! Walk further and you’ll come to The Jewel, a restaurant, as well as Mt Faber cable car station. An easy walk along the footpath. Be careful of traffic. You will then come to a fork (which is actually a loop). Taking the left fork is 700m to Henderson Waves, while the right is 300m.
We took the longer route. Reaching a Danish Seamen Church, we turned right round the loop. Within a few steps, we came to the big sign ‘Henderson Waves’. A beautiful man-made bridge structure. It was very cooling and slightly breezy.
Continuing the walk, you will come to Forest Walk, a metal trail that brings you into the forest canopy. You come very close to nature here, hearing the various birds and insects, plus seeing squirrels. We ended our walk here and returned via the same route after 2.5 hrs. The trail continues further if you wish to walk more.

It is a wooden bridge at a height of 68 meters and has an unusual shape that gives the feeling of waves. Singapore is one of the rare cities where you can enjoy walking through a dense tropical forest right in the middle of the city. A 2.5 kms long tree top walk is one of my favourite activities during every trip to Singapore.
A hour long downpour in the morning had the desired cooling effect and we headed for this trek. It is a thoroughly enjoyable climb that takes you through a forest track and offers spectacular view of the city from the highest point at the Henderson Waves.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-24 12:13:35.540314

We went shopping in Vivocity and then took the cable car up to the Mount Faber station. You then just go down to the road behind the station and head left following the signs for the Henderson Waves. It is well sign posted and a 10 minute slow walk (about 450m). You have to turn right shortly and follow a meandering road downhill. Keep to the path on the right and you'll soon come to a very clear signed entrance to the bridge.
The kids loved running up the sloped sides on the wave sections of the bridge and we spend a good 30 minutes here. At the opposite end there is a path on the left that tales you down the hill through some exercise areas with sit-up tables, pull up bars etc. Eventually you come to a car park and from here we got an Uber cab back to our hotel.

The bridge offers beautiful scenes of greener Singapore uncovered by skyscrapers. I visited Henderson Waves at dusk and lots of locals (couples, families, groups of friends) were hanging out there.

The green foliage of the forest and park area had shielded virtually every man made structure around, some of the tall buildings managed to show themselves though,maybe trying to still score a point for balance.
At this early hour on a weekday, a solitude walk with no one around within a five km radius was exhilarating. The bridge is designed uniquely resembling seven waves rising up and down the deck.
The bridge was made to connect Mt.Faber and Telok Blangah Hill Park a few years ago, the walk is about 1/2 a km and feels like a board walk.

It had started to drizzle a little and I started to walk towards the Mt.Faber park.
From here I could take in a panaromic view of the city, the dense CBD and a rainforest that was slowly opening up through the haze.

We took a taxi to Hort Park, Hyderabad Rd - one of Singapore's newest parks and worth a quick look around. From there it is well sign posted over the pedestrian bridge (Alexandra Arches) and onto the elevated metal walkway. From here there is a gentle incline walk of approx 2km ending at Telok Blangah park. From there it is a short upward stepped path to the Henderson Waves, which is a wide foot bridge that spans Henderson Rd (36 metres above). Henderson waves was signposted as closed (until 31 Jan 2015) for painting, but we asked one of the workers and was waived through......it may have been lunchtime so they were not acutally working. Then we carried on to Mt Faber/Faber Point. We could have easily walked down to Vivo city to catch MRT or bus, but we opted instead to wait outside the Mt Faber cable car and take a taxi after it had dropped off other passengers. It was hot (1pm) so take plenty of water, although there are drinking fountains and nice toilets at Telok Blangah park. The whole walk took only an hour and was VERY easy. Our children are teens, but a robust 5 yr old could do this and you could probably get a buggy up the stepped parts easily enough. This is a nice short walk in the bush - and it's free! Definintey go. This walk would be equally good in the opposite direction (in fact it would be downhill) but I wonder about the ease of transport home at the Hort Park end.",01-2015,Family,2020-01-24 12:14:01.056142

,1,40,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,646187639,16-01-2019,5,Most Reviewers Are Missing the Point,"Henderson Waves is one of the most brilliantly creative concepts I’ve ever encountered anywhere on Earth, and it is utterly unique. But having glanced through a dozen or so reviews, it appears that the majority of out-of-towners reviewing it, are missing the point. It doesn’t matter whether they give the bridge 5 stars or 2: they don’t get it! Some wax rapturous over the view from the bridge, particularly at sunset. Others complain that this bridge-top view isn’t worth the Ridges walk in Singapore heat. One fellow intimates that the unusual construction of the bridge is a clever way of overcoming some knotty engineering problem (perhaps meaning that the bridge bends in an arc from one ridge to another). The unusual construction is certainly creative genius, but I can assure TA readers that it has nothing whatsoever to do with any engineering issue at all.

Yes, the bridge does go over Henderson Road (see Henderson Road photo), and you do take it as the shortest and easiest walk from one ridge to the next. Yes, there is jungle on either side (see Jungle Near and Far photo). I’ll grant you that the view of Reflections on Keppel Bay from the bridge is remarkable, since its futuristic silver lines are in dramatic contrast to the verdant jungle below and the heat-shimmering strait beyond (see Reflections on Keppel Bay photo). Offsetting that, the view looking in the other direction is nothing to enthuse over: you get to see the Bukit Merah district including parts of Henderson Industrial Park: the only conceivable reason anyone would think that view was beautiful was if they owned Henderson Industrial Park (see Bukit Merah photo). You can improve on any of these shots of course, if you throw in a cute companion (see Cute Pedestrian photo). And yes, most important of all, there is that very, very curious way that this bridge was designed and built. As you walk across it, the pedestrian walk and its corresponding railing, for some reason goes up and down, up and down (see Up and Down Up and Down photo). Rather annoying; makes it more difficult to walk across.

But there’s one rather important item related to Henderson Waves that I cannot show you a photo of, and that would be Henderson Waves! Why not? Because no one on Earth can upload a photo of it into TripAdvisor. A video: yes! A still photograph: no; it simply won’t work. The Henderson Waves aren’t invisible. They were there when all these folks submitting their reviews were there, but the reviewers never saw them. Why not? Because, folks, when you are walking across that bridge: YOU are the Henderson Waves! And trust me, if you ever did get a good view of them, you’d agree with me that this is brilliant creativity on steroids!

Would you like to see them? Here’s the easiest way to do it. First, timing is everything: mid-morning on a beautiful weekend day is probably best, since lots of Singaporeans will be walking the Ridges with their families. Catch a taxi or Uber or whatever, and tell the driver you want to get as close to the Henderson Waves bridge as you can, on Henderson Road. They can’t stop directly under it, but they can get you within a reasonably short walk from it. Then, all you do is walk up to where you have a fine view of the bridge: you want to be south of it facing north. Setting your cell-phone onto video would be an excellent idea. Look up at dozens or scores of people above. All those people walking across the bridge, going rhythmically up and down, up and down, up and down. Those folks, up on the bridge: THEY are the Henderson Waves!

(Plan B, by the way, is to walk the Southern Ridges from end to end, but take the stairs down to Henderson Road at the bridge, and then back up again (the harder bit) after you’ve gotten your remarkable video, or at least seen the Waves. If you’re young and spry, Plan B should work for you.)

But remember: having one or two people walking across the bridge when you’re below simply won’t do it: that would be like looking for the waves on a lake during a dead calm. You want to time it to see 30, 40 or 50 of these human waves on the bridge at the same time, rhythmically moving up and down, up and down, up and down. I doubt there’s a Scrooge anywhere on Earth so mean-spirited that he wouldn’t get a hearty laugh out of it, and start slapping his thighs. What a hoot! That, folks, is what put the Waves into Henderson Waves.

p.s. Answering a TA question, I put less than one hour to view the Henderson Waves, but trust me, if you include this as part of the complete Southern Ridges Walk it will take several hours.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-24 12:14:22.469731

But to call it a bridge isn’t doing it justice - it’s also an artwork. It’s the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. Built of timber, it gently rises to 78m at the western end. It’s also lit up at night, but I’m not sure that’s worth a special trip.

There are plenty of buses to Henderson Road (Google Maps will help you here), and then a stiff climb up steps to get to the bridge itself, or walk on from Mount Faber.

How to get there:
The best way to get there is via taxi since there is no MRT line in that area.
However, if you want to be adventurous, follow Google Map's suggestion.
From the Merlion Park, walk to your left, about 3 mins (180 meters) towards the OUE Bayfront Bus Stop
Take Bus 131
After 14 stops, alight at Aft Telok Blangah Hts Bus stop (better tell the bus captain that you are going to Henderson Bridge).

This is a free attraction and the great thing about this part of the city is that the walk extends to a viewpoint across the whole city.

A visit to Henderson Waves therefore means other great sights are nearby. Henderson Waves itself is certainly worth visiting. Firstly, it is conveniently located next to a bus stop on Henderson Road, which many buses travel past (I took the 176 and have taken the 145 too but there are many others. The SMRT travel app will keep you right!). Secondly, it is situated at a high elevation and in an area of natural beauty, with terrific views of the park vegetation and wildlife, but also of some of the urban features of Singapore, such as the port. Finally, the Henderson Waves as a structure is pretty cool, with the waves incorporated into the wooden decking but also the bridge structure itself. If you are interested in architecture or civil engineering you will be interested in this! Benches are incorporated into the decking, so you can sit, enjoy the breeze and views. I would allow 60 mins for the Henderson Waves, but maybe 3-4 hours to explore everything the area has to offer, such as the Southern Ridges, etc.",10-2018,Solo,2020-01-24 12:15:40.756758

The bridge and all around has cameras and it made me feel safe.
All the environment and atmosphere is just reenergising and fill us with peace and gratitude.
I didn' t do the full walk because it was to long for me, instead I took the bus 124 in a bus stop at Orchard Road and I asked the driver to let me out at the closest bus stop to the Henderson Waves. He was very friendly and showed me the steps I should go in order to get there. It was a steep step to get to the top, but the bridge was there!

From there I went for a walk in what they call Tree Top Walk.
That was the best experience for me. Not because of the beauty only but because of the feelings it brings. Imagine you walking above the top of the trees...
The bridge is totally safe and you can see under your feet the trees, relax with the birds singing and being surprise with the contrast view between the amazing nature and the city in the background!

For me to come back to Orchard Road and have all MRT stations I just got the bus 166.

(Not recommend for people suffering from vertigo. But there is a solution, just walk straight for 300 meters without looking down.)

View is awesome! Tall buildings side-by-side facing north, and greenery by Singapore Strait facing south.

Take your family here and allot half a day in order for you to enjoy the other attractions at the Southern Ridge. Spend bonding moments with your kids at Mt. Faber Park and Telok Blangah Park, 2 areas connected by Henderson Waves. This is a great way to enjoy nature in Singapore. I encountered a couple of squirrels by the road on the way to the bridge. I heard you may even meet monkeys along the way.

Some tips:
- Don't forget to wear light comfortable shoes for walking a couple of kilometers.

In fact, the vicinity of the bridge (the areas ahead from both ends of the bridge and the area around the road below) is so green and luscious that you might even think you're not in Singapore (for sure, not in a typical ""urban jungle"" among highrises that Singapore is known for)! While taking in those green sceneries, you could also sit down ""inside the waves"" on the nice wooden benches kind of blended into the wave structures.

You could walk here from VivoCity (take the MRT to HarbourFront station which is at the bottom of VivoCity by the purple or yellow lines) by turning left on the road in front of VivoCity and walking until hitting the intersection with Henderson Rd, then by turning right onto Henderson until you see the bridge above with the steps to it on your right, the walk that will take 30 minutes or so. But if you're not sure finding it on your own, you might just want to take a taxi from in front of VivoCity; it will just be like a 5-minute ride which will just cost you a small amount. And conveniently for the way back, there's a bus stop right under the bridge (the stop is just by the steps to the bridge) to get back to across the street in front of VivoCity.",12-2014,Solo,2020-01-24 12:16:11.852253

I still believe in myself, because I made a video for a very special person in my life. My expectation at the time was that other tourists may not give money to me because I am not looking for money for my actions, enough to make laugh.

This bridge links Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Park crossing Henderson Road 36 meters above it. At one end it rises to almost 80 meters above sea level. The bridge itself is a wooden plank walkway attached to a wave shaped frame, hence the name. At regular intervals the height above sea level is etched into the wooden planks.
A good way to spend a morning is to go for a walk at Mount Faber Park, then cross the bridge to Telok Blangah Park.
Some people, I noticed come here with their cameras and telephoto lenses to photograph monkeys in the trees. The view from the bridge is very nice. In the middle, under a part of the waveform is a wooden sitting area in case you want to rest or just relax and take in the view.

No monkeys sadly and a downpour of rain but it's a beautiful way to see Singapore and have some idea of its layout. You pass through old military areas, black and white colonial houses and so much of Singapore's fabled verdure. I saw hardly another human being. Of course it was pouring but I suspect that this Southern Ridges walk is not yet well known. Do try it but beware..... at one point in the walk you have to descend onto a main road and continue the other side into Mnt Faber Park to get to the cable car.

But if you're looking for something free and beautiful in expensive Singapore. Or if you just looking for some sweat, go here.

The bridge itself was only 300m long. And there are stairs (don't worry) to go up. You can go here using bus since the bus stop is right under the bridge, google the bus number! Or you can ride MRT to Harborfront then change to the bus.

Tips: go here when sunset comes. It is busy with runners, but the scenery was beautiful. You can see the city of Singapore at the bridge. And don't forget to bring mineral water or snacks and enjoy the view.",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-24 12:17:01.036869

Actually it wasn’t that bad to begin with where there are lots trees and shades as we trek uphill. But the weather started to get VERY hot when we had to walk one big round to get back to our vehicle, even though that already seems to be the shortest path we could have taken.


Everytime we drove past this place, we could always see this bridge hanging in mid air. But it never comes across our minds on where it would lead to. Since we are bringing the dog out for her Sunday walk, we decided to explore the area, despite the very crazy weather !
We are standing right in the middle of the bridge and boy… the view is magnificent… I mean of course, compare to those famous hill tops in other countries, it’s peanuts.. but then, in an island of practically zero suburbs, here’s indeed something different.
And hey, I can see my house from the bridge !! Did you spot some yellowish color flats in the faraway background ? Yes, that’s the place where I usually hibernate myself. :)
pack of forest greens. Will it be gone one day to make way for the ever increasing population of land-scarce Singapore ? Sigh.
Take a closer look, did you see that Z like thingy in the picture ? That’s a super long flight of staircase that we will be attempting soon to get down.",04-2015,Friends,2020-01-24 12:17:27.482426

Spent a day at the bridge just chilling around. We also made our way towards the forest but did not manage to fully explore it. Nice architecture and concept, you could even picnic there if you wish. Only downside is that it is not covered hence it could be a tad too hot to chill there in the afternoon. Lucky the weather was just nice for us to chill as it rained in the morning. During sunset would be the best time to be there to experience Henderson Waves.
Be well informed that the restroom is pretty far down the route from the bridge.
There are many sections there to explore, you might/might not be able to cover the whole area within a day. Plan your trip well.
You could get there through the cable car (which connects to Mount Faber) or by bus. Alight at station Redhill and take bus 145. It's just 7 stops away and it stopped right under the bridge.",05-2015,Friends,2020-01-24 12:17:32.772010

Then we stood by the bus stop at vivo city and just trying to find a bus heading/passing henderson road/telok blangah park/mount faber park. I think there are 3 busses heading that area.

The buss we rode drove pass under the henderson wave bdrige. Thus we got off soonest we can on the nearest bus stop and just wLk towards it. There Are stairs entering the park on each sides (either mount faber or telok blangah). U can just pick one.

Its lovely place for mini hike. With good weather and perfect outfit, i enjoyed it very much. Something different of singapore for me.

After reach the Hort Park, I usually take bust to go home to save my energy :)
What I admire about the Henderson Waves is, it's over great view in the morning. Thinking that how the government try to add value of it rather than just make a simple bridge, they build something to make it different. Even when walking in the forest, we don't have to step on the soil, but they made the path from steel so it's like a long long pavement to walk to make it comfort.

Why people make a fuss of this bridge I really don’t know. It is a bridge. It connects Mt Faber to Telok Blangah Heights. It is a mildly interesting architectural oddity en route from Mt Faber to the Kent Ridge Gardens.
If it was to be of any real use, why not complete the shelters? They have carefully built some wavy forms and futuristic resting places, grottoes even, on the side of the bridge so that you can watch the sun set. Lovely. The sad thing is: when it rains you get wet.
Why did they not add a roof? They waived the need for naves in the waves. It is a pity about that.",04-2013,Friends,2020-01-24 12:17:45.406380
