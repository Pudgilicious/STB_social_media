While rest of Singapore seems both clean and safe, Little India is the exact opposite.

At times it felt really intimidating, especially since a few of these men seemed either drunk or mentally ill.

It seems all the low income population has been housed in this area its not clean even though there are many colourful shop houses and Hindu Temples.

,1,61,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Holstwnsnd,677894061,31-05-2019,1,Slums of Singapore,"I was super excited to visit Little India. Whilst in Singapore, my accommodation was near to Chinatown (which is amazing) so I was expecting a similar vibe from Little India. Instead, it was very unwelcoming and all of our party (a mix of ages and genders) were in agreement that we couldn't wait to leave - we all felt a bad vibe.

Little India is dirty. It is basically a slum. The majority of Singapore is very clean and environmentally conscious, yet, Little India seems to be the complete opposite. There is dirt, rotting food and rubbish everywhere. The smell was overwhelmingly vile - in particular in the Tekkah Centre where you could see the birds feasting on the ""fresh"" meat that was for sale. The shops were full of cheap and tacky souvenirs, frequently without prices on.The other shops seemed to be aimed towards local individuals, rather than tourists, as they sold electronics, phones, clothing and gold. Not sure why people care for the Mustafa centre - it is just a huge shopping centre selling all types of rubbish. It is essentially a crap version of TX Maxx or Costco that also sells a few watches. It is absolutely rammed with anything and everything you could think of and not in a good way. It is definitely not anything you need to prioritise visiting.

Lots of unfriendly men, hanging around idly on the street corners who enjoyed staring at any young woman who passed and frequently shouted at us and made inappropriate comments - despite none of our party dressing inappropriately or deliberately attempting to attract attention. As a female, I felt unsafe and I dread to think what would have happened if we were not accompanied by the men in our party. It was also the only area in Singapore where I was approached by beggars for money and there were numerous of these female beggars dotted around who constituted the only women that seemed to be in the area.

Yes - some of the colours and the architecture is amazing but is few and far between. It is not packed with colourful streets like you see on google images - there are a handful of these at most. I walked around for ages expecting to find hidden gems but alas, there were none. The temples are pretty but these alone do not negate the bad aspects of Little India. I would avoid visiting and enjoy other areas of Singapore.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-31 09:09:27.844886

My kids had henna done on their hands and wrists which looked pretty cool at the Little India Arcade 48 Serangoon road about 2 doors down from a 7-11, a jewelry store and a money changer that had the best rates I've seen in Singapore. For the henna it's cash only, your wife or daughters will probably love it and think it's cool. Check out some of the temples but don't take pictures of people inside unless they say it's okay to do so.

Sir Raffles while setting up Singapore City in early 1800 AD planned for separate enclaves for Indian, Chinese & Malay origin people. Indians were located at Little India.
Indian population is dominated by those from Southern India, mainly TN. Other sections live at inter mixed areas of the Enclave.
By now a large compact part of LI houses migrants from BD, about One Million of them. They are mainly engaged in unskilled odd jobs, shop keeping and of course running Eateries.
Sometimes back unprecedented rioting took place here over accidental death of a construction labour. Buses were torched, shops looted in LI. 23 people were wounded. Government came down heavily on law breakers by arresting, prosecuting, deporting many immigrants. Afterwards several restrictions were imposed on gathering of people in open areas, sale & consumption of liquor etc. Though the rioting was largely spearheaded by BDs, image of Indian communities were tarnished.
LI is a popular destination of Tourists from Kolkata, mainly for hopping at Mustafa Super Mart, cheap Gift items at roadside stalls and finally for Dal, Bhat aar Eleesh Mach (Hilsa Fish).",06-2018,Family,2020-01-31 09:10:10.956280

Musaffa a well known 24 hours shopping mall under 1 roof next to Farrer Park train station (Purple Line) is must go place at any time.
Its easy to move around and easy travelling by buses and trains (Little India Station-Purple Line)

Most of the buildings are very old shophouses which are preserved and some converted to boutique hotels and restaurants. Visit the wet market and see the lifestyle of everyday Singaporeans.

A must see place to see especially in October when the streets are lighted up for the Indian Festival of Lights Celebration with more shops and bazaars.

Each ethnic community has, over the years taken an area and has developed it into a little world of its own. Little India is one of them. Helped by the Government to preserve the ancient ulture of India in Singapore, the local Indians have built temples, shops, restaurants, etc showcasing their culture.

Little India is the name given to the lower part of Serrangoon Road, Bukit Timah Road, Selegie Road, Rochor, etc. Shops overflowing with saris, kurtas, jewellery, handicrafts can be seen along these roads and side lanes as well. The Hindu temples are usually from the Southern part of India, colourful and decorated with idols from the Hindu pantheon of Gods. There are Churches and Mosques too, with Tamil sermons.

There are umpteen number of restaurants serving South and North Indian cuisines. Many serve vegetarian food as well as a large section of the community is vegetarian.

Recently, a beautiful, well designed state of the art, Indian Heritage Museum depicting the history and heritage of Indians who had come to settle here bringing with them their beautiful culture has been built by the Government. This is one of my favourite haunts when I take my guests around Little India.

There is so much to see, buy, eat and enjoy in this area. Set aside a day or two to explore and find treasures. During Indian Festivals such as Navarathri, Pongal and Deepavali the place is lit up and shops offer specially imported goods for that season. During Navarathri, for example, the temples arrange a doll festival, dances, classical music, etc. Deepavali is very special and the roads are decorated with colourful lights and artwork.

This is the historical and cultural hub of the Indian community and the colours, sounds and scents of India greet the visitor at every turn. From colourful saris to fragrant perfumes and spices, from the strains of sitar to the cacophony of traffic, Little India is a heady mix of shopping, sightseeing and feasting for tourists and locals alike.

And like elsewhere on the island, the Chinese and Malays do a roaring trade side by side with their Indian compatriots, transcending language and cultural barriers.

What to see and do in Little India:

1. Rows of old shophouses jostling for custom against the backdrop of modern malls such as The Verge and Mustafa Centre, the latter known for its wide range of electronics and home appliances at competitive prices. There are bargains galore at many clothing stores with all manner of street wear like jeans, shoes and t-shirts spilling onto the sidewalks. Not forgetting the numerous souvenir shops and jewellers selling gold and precious stones. And the treasure trove of art, handicraft, antiques, and sacred objects awaiting your discovery on the main street and the side lanes.

2. Indian Heritage Centre which showcases the rich culture of the ethnic Indians with displays and shows.

3. The Temple of a Thousand Lights, a Buddhist temple famous for its 15m high seated Buddha statue on the ground floor and a reclining Buddha in the basement.

4. The Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple set in lush grounds with public housing in the background. Colourful statues of Hindu deities adorn the top of the perimeter walls and main building.

5. Explore the many facets of Indian cuisine at eateries big and small in Little India. From fiery curries originating in the Tamil south of the Indian subcontinent to delicately spiced cuisine from the northern regions. Northern Indian specialties like briyani and tandoori chicken fit for a maharajah are readily available. Vegetarians will not miss out on their dosai, vadai and apom, and those needing a quick fix can head for the eateries modelled on western fast food joints.

6. A popular Indian dish is fish head curry, which has been the inspiration for several versions sold in Chinese food outlets.

7. Mainstays like prata and murtabak have their following in restaurants and cooked food centres, where popular snacks such as curry puffs and goreng pisang (fried banana fritters) are also to be found. Favourite drinks include lime juice and “teh tarik” (pulled tea), a frothy milk tea repeatedly “pulled” between two large metal mugs.

8. Come sundown small plazas tucked between tall residential blocks spring to live with diners chilling out under swaying palms and romantic lights.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-31 09:11:52.401967

There are tailors sitting at sewing machines on the footpath, buy a pair of $5 jeans or a $10 shirt and they'll alter them for you, right there.

I walked past a little food shop and an elderly chap behind the desk said 'hello' as I passed, so I decided to try their food. I love eating 'locally' when I travel, I can't stand the sight of a white tablecloth! Down the back of the shop was a row of benches with trestles to sit on, and lots of obviously local people enjoying a meal. I ordered from the counter, even though the cook couldn;t spe English, and I ended up with a delicious Indian meal, far more than I could eat, for $9.00...

The Singapore shopping scene is usually associated more with futuristic mega-malls, with ultra-designer brands in gleaming air-conditioned open spaces. Little India, however, presents a very different story; one that’ll probably leave you with a longer lasting impression, as well as more cash left over in your back pocket.

From 24-hour shopping centres to bustling markets and street stalls, the range of shopping in this vibrant Singapore neighbourhood is just as diverse as its people, culture and food. Whether its clothes, electronics, fresh food, souvenirs, artwork or traditional Indian products, our list of the 10 Best Shopping in Little India will have you covered.

Open 24 hours, the Mustafa Centre offers a unique market style shopping experience. Designer products are in abundance at low prices with everything from textiles to watches and electronics on sale. The mall is actually two department stores joined together with goods sold under the Mustafa name and streamlined by type. One of the main attractions is the jewellery sections where gold can be picked up inexpensively, the centre is also a great place to buy Asian inspired gifts to take back home. Accessories are brilliant buys, mostly hand made with an eclectic ethnic touch, from bags to costume jewellery that you won’t find anywhere else.

You may not know that Little India once had a racecourse, cattle herders and brick kilns.

But while these places and people are gone, time stands still in pockets of this historic district.

Olden-day TRADES sit next to newer businesses: flower-garland vendors, modern eateries, boutique hotels, as well as arts groups.

A colourful past

Little India today is one of Singapore’s most vibrant districts.
In the 1840s, Europeans lived here mainly for the racecourse, where they met and mingled.

When cattle trading took root, it became a mostly Indian TRADE as traders hired Indian migrant workers. Certain goods and services took off, and mosques and Hindu temples were built.

Buzzing culture

Little India today is one of Singapore’s most vibrant districts. As you walk down Serangoon Road and neighbouring streets, explore their mix of Hindu and Chinese temples, mosques and churches.

Fill your tummy with South Indian vegetarian food, North Indian tandoori dishes and local fare like roti prata (round pancakes) and teh tarik (pulled tea in Malay). Try to spot the brewers ‘pull’ the hot milk tea – it’s amazing showmanship.

Outside the MRT you can reach the Tekka Food Centre where you can eat Duck rice, Nasi Bryani and Mee Siam.
In Little India you can see Hindu temples and churches. The Kampong Kapor Methodist Church is here. The area around Dunlop Street, Serangoon Road and Desker Road are full of Indian shops selling vegetables, curries and Indian products. Some stalls sell the beautiful Indian garlands which are snapped up by the Indians to be used in religious ceremonies.
Many tourists come here to buy Indian products and also visit the Indian Heritage Centre which houses the legacies of famous Indian Singaporeans.
Many goldsmiths here are Chinese but their shops have a shopfront full of Indian and Tamil words as their clients are mostly Indians both local and from abroad. Many foreign workers from India and Bangladesh make a beeline for this place on Sundays to purchase their goodies and groceries from the famous Mustafa Centre which is a 5-level shopping mall and opens 24/7. You can buy anything from a pin to an oven or a fridge. The goods sold here are good and cheap .

So on this our 6th visit to Singapore we decided to go back to Little India and see what it was like.

Similar to visiting China Town really, i.e. lots of shops offering souvenirs and cheap goods. We also visited a temple (missed the big one) but the one we did go to was very interesting and had lots of people in various stages of prayer. Don't forget to take your shoes off!!!!

Also visited a huge people's food hall where there was so much food on offer it was hard to choose, this was at close to the MRT station so not hard to find.

Also wandered into a large kinda department store (I guess) with several floors. This place had everything so I guess it's where the locals do all their shopping. My husband bought two shirts for $10.00 each and I thought they will probably wash like rags because they were so cheap, but after being home and getting washed several times they are still as good as new and look great. Next trip he will definitely be going back there for more.

If you are after gold, then Little India is definitely the place to go. Indian's love their gold and they have shop after shop of nothing but gold, not my style but I'm sure you can find something if you are into gold.

Avoid the weekends unless you like throngs of people. Lots of small inexpensive restaurants with tasty food everywhere. There is a Hindu temple that is large and colourful.

The Mustafa Centre is a giant shop stretching 3 city blocks where you can find EVERYTHING at arguably the best prices in town. Great place to change money as well.

Very good access to and from Little India with the mrt. Both the yellow and purple lines are a relatively short walk from Mustafa’s which is at the heart of Little India.

You can also stopover at Mustapha Shopping Centre as it is the biggest shopping mall of few floors selling everything you name it, they have it. Provided you have time to browse through every nick and corner of this crowded Shopping Centre. At the same time gives you the feeling that you are like in an Indian city especially on Weekends.
Of course, you don’t get to see flies and mosquitos like in India. Here you will feel safer and it’s a totally different experience.
Prices of most products here are reasonable.
On the 2nd floor you can get branded toiletries and fragrances, medicines, health products etc etc.
Souvenir hunters can go to the 3rd floor for a large selection of choices. You can also shop for toys in the basement and also clothes for all ages including some brands items like Sportswear, imported Polo t-shirts, shirts etc etc.
On the 5th floor are also A very big supermarket where all kinds of imported as well as local products, are available.
Only thing is too many things and too narrow and cramp if it’s too overly crowded. But you get lots of bargain items.

It’s quite hot so we decided to venture here via the hop on and hop off bus you can get and enjoy what the place had to offer. Lots of wonderful jewellery shops and great places to eat. We did find however a lot of junk shops were saturating the streets here as well which was of no interest to us. Take advantage of the amazing fabrics and fashion designs on offer. We bought lots of colourful and beautiful pieces and very good prices. We did see there was a walking tour on offer too but we liked to stop and stroll at our own leisure and take in the temples and cultural delights. I do recommend to go earlier or later and stop for a bite to eat somewhere along the way in Little India if you like Indian spices and food. We enjoyed our morning here but wouldn’t go back unless specifically shopping for another beautiful Indian outfit or fabric.,11-2017,Couples,2020-01-31 09:15:26.814424

Little India, as we were told by one of the locals, represents the culture of a specific region of India and they have some really good food there and the markets are appealing to the tourist... but there was an aspect that wasn't as interesting as Chinatown and I honestly can't put my finger on what was. We came here late afternoon and this area started to have more colours as the contrast, between dusk and the street lights, makes it beautiful to watch. At this time, the aroma of spices comes to full power. We stopped at a restaurant that was recommended to us, is a restaurant following the free economy model (you pay what you think your food was worth) and the food was pretty good but after walking for 30 minutes, we found ourselves reading the guide, checking if there was anything else to visit around.

I love the Chicken Dum Biryani rice from Yakader Muslim Food at Tekka Market and the vegetarian feast at Komala Vilas. Mustafa Centre is also the place I head to for low priced exotic tea leaves.

However, I will advise you to AVOID SUNDAYS - especially if you are female! The situation is so bad that even my local ethnic Indian girlfriends would not go to Little India on Sundays, unless for very, VERY good reasons.

See, Sunday is the only day-off for our community of foreign Indian/Bangladeshi/Sri Lankan workers, hence Little India is extremely crowded as they head there to meet friends from their respective hometowns. And yes, they DO STARE at everybody - even if you are not female and blondie-blue-eyed... Maybe it's not rude in their culture to stare but yes, we can feel violated by just being stared at...

I will never understand those people who deliberately visit Little India on Sundays then complain its crowded, dirty or unsafe. C'mon, where there is a crowd, there is a chance for trash and security issues - applies to ANYWHERE in the world. Given today's availability of internet, one has to be a seriously hapless tourist do zero research before heading there (or anywhere).

So I would suggest that we be nice, and let the workers enjoy their precious Sunday off. We can go there any day, but they cannot, due to work commitment. So avoid Sundays and weekend evenings and it'll be fine.

Tip: Go earlier. It gets crowded after hours.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-31 09:15:36.392520

Maybe I was influenced by the heat, or the humidity or the fact that I went on a Sunday instead of a weekday ...... Crowds of mass humanity blocked sidewalks and shopping centers galore making for uncomfortable passage.

I spent 1 HR there and was ready to leave after 6.5 minutes however; I emersed my wife into a somewhat longer time frame.

Afterwards she told me she was ready to leave after 5 minutes ... So I slightly misjudged her reactions to the place.

Part of the problem was that we clearly had two different ideas on what we wanted but the trainee waiter confused us completely. We got another waiter who did his best but we just felt at sea. Then we noticed an iPad under papers.....would have made it easier. What turned up was tasty enough but one larger course never arrived but at least it was not on the bill.

Whilst we were waiting we were served complementary vegetable samosas.

The food and accompanying sauces were really tasty - full of flavour - the dahl was rich and thick - the vegetable curry full fresh vegetables ... both were spicy and mildly hot!

The masala dosa was fresh ... large ... and very tasty!!! And the naan ... hot and cheesy ... how I like them.

Perhaps one could argue that I could've visited during the daytime and tried some of the local food, but even so, I feel as though I would have found it very hard to do so due to the lack of appeal this district had and my fear of getting sick from unsanitary cooking conditions.

,1,61,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/robert_and_anne,433297379,31-10-2016,3,Is it Singapore or India?,"This neighborhood has arisen because under British rule emigrants from India were allowed to settle there alone (Similarly 'Chinatown' originated in Singapore). It consists of several streets and between the blocks there are covered markets in the budget segment.

Walking there on the narrow paths between the stalls with their colorful items such as clothing, food, jewelry, things for the home, leather, etc. you get the feeling that you’re in India. In the streets you can find low-rise buildings with small shops such as jewelers, electronics affairs, eateries , who are all focused on their Indian clients. But tourists are equally welcome . The area is not unsafe, but the buildings are poorly maintained and the streets themselves are dirty, lacking sidewalks, or these are filled with junk. And then the clean Singapore feels suddenly a long way away.

It gave me a little cultural shock but it was also intriguing: not because of the shabby streets; that's just a little piece of India. But that such an area exists in the most clean and regulated nation, 100 meters away from each other !? Of course you can visit Little India just to buy a cheap piece of clothing. But with me questions arose like: ‘Does other rules for pollution apply here, or why are they not observed? Is there sufficient public money available and who decides how it is spend? Mix the two populations or are there social tensions?’
Those questions remain. But they make a visit to this part of Singapore (or is it India?) all the more intriguing.

Tip: in october/november Hindus celebrate 'Deepavali', the festival of lights and then you should pay a visit in the evening. Not because you see less of the dirt, but because the festive lighting above the streets and the many oil lamps that are extra interred in the shops and homes, create an fabulous atmosphere.",10-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 09:18:22.663296

What greeted us was the appalling contrast between that of Chinatown and the rubbish strewn streets we were in and the plethora of goldsmiths and food places.
Whilst this was a contrast to other areas of Singapore, it was also very different from the real India and merely a commercial area for Indians and of little or no interest if you don't want to dine.

Few suggestions:

1. Tekka Centre - food centre & wet market. Don't miss this place. It's just above the Little India MRT station exit. Probably best place in Singapore to get widest choices of good Indian food at cheap prices. Also available, are Chinese food here.
Try the Briyani rice & Teh Tarik (milk tea). There is a wet market next to food centre worth a visit.

2. The main road & many side streets shops - where you find many traditional shops & products. Get soaked in the cultural atmosphere here.

3. Indian temple - next to Belilios Street. Can't miss it as facing main road of Little India. Alot of tourists goes there.

4. City Square Mall- nice modern big mall with international dining & shops. Linked to Farrer Park MRT station ( NE Line).

5. The Verge mall- directly opposite Tekka Centre. Though this mall is not worth your time as pretty small & boring, if have time- still worth a visit to the big supermarket there ie Sheng Shiong. They sell live seafood in tanks- interesting. Good place to buy your cheap drinks, etc.

6. Mustafa Centre - one has not ""seen"" Little India if one hasn't been to this world famous store. It's huge, prices are reasonable & it carries many unique products not found anywhere else in Singapore.
Place is always crowded with locals, foreign residents & tourists alike. Can easily spend 1/2 hours here.

I honestly didn't think that much of it. Yes, it's different to the rest of clean/sanitised Singapore, so certainly feels like you're in another part of the city. But is it really like India? No, not particularly. India is much busier, more chaotic and far dirtier (and full of cows pooing everywhere).
What bothered me the most about Little India was the lack of women. I went to see the Tan Teng Niah, and the whole surrounding square and eateries were filled with men. As a lone woman walking around at dusk I am very conscious of my surroundings, and I saw only one other woman the whole time I was in that particular area (also a tourist, but she was with a male companion). I wasn't hassled and didn't feel unsafe per se, but I can't say I was all that comfortable being the sole female surrounded by hundreds of men (this seemed to be a common theme across most of the streets of Little India I walked around... for every 1 women there were 100 men, apart from some women in jewellery and fashion stores).
The Mustafa Centre is interesting to walk through due to the sheer volume of items they have for sale, but the prices aren't cheap so don't go here expecting to find a bargain.
To be honest, the Arab quarter is much nicer and I recommend going to Bussorah Street and Haji Lane (Kampong Glam).",06-2018,Solo,2020-01-31 09:21:05.265350

If you are coming to Singapore from now till end of October do stay in Little India where there are many hotels to suit your budget and this place has all the amenities that is within walking distance. All the Indian cuisine, garment and textile shops, electrical equipment, gold smiths, temples are ever present. Everywhere you turn in the side streets are restaurants, groceries, and little flower garland shops. This time of the year the streets are dressed in neon best to greet the Indian Festival of Deepavali.

Situated in Serangoon Road from the Rochor Canal onwards Little India started as a Kampong (Village) that was originally a division of ethnic Indian immigrants to Singapore. Serangoon Road today, is a very busy one way thoroughfare and both sides are crowded with pedestrians, more than 70% whom are Indians, both local and tourists. Sounds of Indian music give the place a sense of Indian culture.

Beside the Rochor Canal is Tekka Market which is a multi-cultural center with goods that catered for ethnic groups although the there are more stalls that sell Indians produce or food. At the other end of the road about 1 km away is the famous Indian Department Store and Supermarket, Mustaffa.

There used to be shops that had the machinery to grind spices into powder but modernization had stop the practice and ready mix spices can be easily available in the shops. Tours to the area should include the two Hindu Temples, Sri Veeramakalimman Temple and Sri Srinivasa Prerumal Temple, a Chinese temple Leong San Temple, the Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple and a Muslim Mosque. There are no entrance charges at these places of worship however you are expected to take off your footwear before entering the Indian temples.

One has to note that Indians of today are scattered like other races to stay in housing estates under the Government Plan for racial harmony though many still reside in Little India. The Indian commercial businesses are still concentrated at Little India just like that of the Chinese businesses in Chinatown.

Many bus routes past through Serangoon Road. The MRT ran two lines in Little India Station and another in Farrer Park Station and there is a taxi stand behind Tekka Market. There are many hotels ranging from Lodges and Backpackers Hostels to four star Wanderlust, and Zen Premium Little India. I counted 20 but there could be more.

You may book up a walking tour which is very popular however one can easily go on a self walking tour and take one’s time at various destinations.

I have to add two unique historical features of Little India. An accident in which an Indian was killed caused a riot (of two hours) when 27 people were injured and scores arrested. This prompted the police to issue a ban of selling and consumption of liquor (in public shops) from 10 pm onwards. A prominently displayed sign still stands today. The ban was spread widely across the island, but through my observation, somewhat loosely applied. However the most significant history of Little India was the collapse of the Hotel New World, a six-storey building situated at the junction of Serangoon Road and Owen Road. Overloading of the building and inferior building materials used caused the rapid collapsed in March 15th 1986, trapping 50 people and 33 people including 10 foreigners were killed. This part of history is always etched in my mind as I was there traveling along Serangoon Road when the accident happened. I heard a very loud boom and saw smoke raising from one kilometer away. It was not smoke but dust from the collapse which was sudden and over within few minutes.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-31 09:21:31.804376

I didn't have weeks in Singapore and so didn't want to waste my time here when there is so much more to do in Singapore.

Firstly I thought Little India itself was pretty grotty. It was dirty compared to the rest of Singapore and there was only one street of shops and sights to see. The shops were full of tat and the few temples they had were all closed, though I could see most of what they had to offer from the outside and in all honesty they aren't worth travelling on the MRT to see.

I went to the Tekka Centre and I was really, really disappointed. It absolutely stunk from all the fish and I wouldn't have dared to eat anything - the hygiene in that place was disgusting and the whole place was extremely dirty. To be fair, this may just be because everywhere else I had been in Singapore was so clean but even by my normal standards it wasn't nice. Also the clothes were all the same, and not particularly cheap at all. Additionally - it was very very hot and there is no air con in there. Due to the amount of stalls there was barely any fresh air getting around which made it feel like an oven and made the stench even worse.

I really wouldn't recommend spending time here, especially if you only have limited time in Singapore (a week or less). I wished I had spent the time in the Museum instead, where I went after.

My advice for ladies visiting the area or even Singapore in general; dress conservatively if you want to avoid too much attention. I stuck to maxi dresses and keeping at minimum, my shoulders covered, as I felt it was being respectful to the locals cultural beliefs. I was also trying to avoid attention, and it definitely helped a lot.
As for Little India, I really loved this area. The Mustafa centre is a lot of fun to explore, and bring open 24/7 was a dream.

This time I decided to walk from Little India MRT to Farrer Road MRT along Serangoon Road. I have also done it the other way around.

After leaving Little India station I visited Tekka Centre. I wasn't hungry so I just had a refreshing watermelon juice in the food centre. I then walked up the stairs to the 1st Floor where all the clothing is for sale.

This is a colourful sight and I always find a few items of clothing to buy. I found the assistants to be very helpful as I was looking for something specific and, fortunately, I was in luck and left happy with my purchases.

I then crossed Serangoon Road and entered Little India Arcade. I tell myself each time that I'm going to avoid going in here because the stall owners are quite aggressive in their touting for business, however, I was again lured in. I ended up succumbing to the persuasiveness of one of the sellers and bought a few nice cotton tops. We settled on a price which worked out to S$25 each which, in retrospect, may have been too much, however I like them and they seem to be of good quality.

I slowly wandered up Serangoon Road, carefully watching where I was walking because I have found that there are many uneven surfaces on the side walk. Sometimes I will be walking along on the narrow pathway between the produce for sale on either side and all of a sudden there will be a step down. Then, after walking for a short time there will be a step up. It can be very dangerous so please be careful.

Along the way I found a couple of remote controlled toys for my little grandsons and some cheap costume jewellery for myself (3 for S$10). I also ducked into Mustafas and bought a pair of cheap sandals, but I didn't have the stamina to tackle any more of the store.

I would normally be hungry by this time and would look for some Indian food, however as I had been suffering from a virus, and still didn't feel 100%, I decided to get a cold drink from City Square Mall which is almost attached to Farrer Park MRT, and then get the train back to my hotel.

I have been here twice on this visit, but although as a South Asian I like to stroll along Serangoon Road, and browse in the shops selling clothes, bangles, incense, music, some handicrafts and jewelry, and offer a variety of Indian food, it still feels short of much that could add value to its name.

Given that the majority of the Indian community in Singapore hails from the south of India, one wishes to come across glimpses of the huge diversity of that country, and a bit of representation from at least a few of its many states. This is sorely missing from Little India. There's gold jewelry galore, and many shops that sell heavy, bridal gold jewelry. One wants to see many more saree shops, many more handicrafts from India's different regions, music in various languages of that country, and more variety in the cuisines.

The large 'everything under one roof' kind of store called Mustafa is a complete clutter. Though it has every imaginable item - from fresh fruit, vegetables to cosmetics, from detergents to electronics, but the place offers no sense of design and it presents a picture that's more like a bazaar than a department store.

Some maintenance of the footpaths and fewer or no encroachment on them could also elevate the general ambience of Little India. However, it is nice for the South Asian as well as other communities to get a taste of India here, albeit a small taste.",06-2016,Solo,2020-01-31 09:22:28.505501

Little India at Serangoon Road is a microcosm of cultural, retail and religious spaces synonymous with what you will see in different parts of India. You will be able to see various Temples, viz:
-Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. Hindu Temple
-Sri Srinivasa Perumal Temple. Hindu Temple.
-Sakya Muni Buddha Gaya Temple. Buddhist Temple

There are a multitude of retail spaces along the whole stretch selling fabric, Indian gold (which has deeper gold hue compared to the usual gold pieces you see in some of the mainstream malls), spices etc. Many gravitate towards Mustaffa Centre which practically sells everything from electronic goods to eggs.

You will be spoilt for choice when it comes to dining options since there are food establishments practically on each corner. The notable ones that most tend to gravitate to are:

a. Tekka Centre (665 Buffalo Road) - loads of food stalls in the hawker centre here, and there tends to be a Long queue for Alauddins Biryani located at stall number #01-232

b. Banana Leaf Apollo (48 Serangoon Road) to sample the infamous fish head curry and Masala chicken. Having said that, there are many restaurants along the same stretch like Muthu’s Curry, Gayathri and Delhi Restaurant for you to choose from

c, The French Stall (544 Serangoon Road)....just because it’s relatively inexpensive French cuisine located in of all places, Little India

d. Ananda Bhavan restaurant (58 Serangoon Road) - ideal for vegetarians

As for those who warn against visiting on the proviso that the area is flooded by men who gawp at western women, yes, Indian culture is male dominant, but they stare out of curiosity just as we all do at the different. This is their home and we are visitors. Sometimes tourists have such an air of superiority and prissiness.

However, when I was there I saw a little incident.

I traveled through with some other travels staying in a hostel/pub. I liked it there and the people were very friendly. The local area was nice and there are plenty of shops to see and things to do on a walk around.

One night while drinking with a few other travelers, there were some locals outside shouting and arguing. I went outside, with some others to see what was going on and a massive fight broken out. About 20 people in total.
One guy pulled out a knife and stabbed another guy. Then everyone ran.

The area is patrolled by Security and they turned up first. The injured man hobbled into a near by shop. The Police came and I was the only one to tell the Police where the injured man and the guy who stabbed him were. They did not want to know and said its best if I just stay out of it.. really weird and then they left.
The only thing I could think of was that this must have been gang related.

I would go there again and it might be that this was just a one off, I did feel safe until this happened. Moved to another Hostel the next day to be sure.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 09:25:58.700235

When to go? all year round but especially before Deepavali (Diwali). So in October. Streets look like on Christmas eve... only it's hot and humid.

Why to go? It's just something else. Not the spotless Singapore but more of a mess. A beautiful mess.

How to get there? If you weren't informed already in Singapore public transport is great and simple. So go get it. MRT has a stop called Little India.

Want the full package? Go on a Sunday. All the Indians will be there and it's a great experience. After 30 minutes you might get really tired. Information overload.

Families - it might be fun but avoid Sundays. Better. You might lose each other in that traffic. It is safe though.

Couples - it's fun, there are many cool shops and some that just make no sense

Solo travelers - you know what to do; stroll around with no exact destination; also try the Hindu temple.

Group of friends - make extra friends there, people are chatty.

Bonus missions:
Try Mustafa Center. It's open 24/7.
Try Tekka Center for some Indian food. My North Indian work mate (Punjabi) took me here and told me it's the only place in Singapore where the food tastes likes ""home"". I wouldn't argue with him.

At Little India I found it harder to identify the unique Indian influences, apart from the obvious proliferation of Indian restaurants.

My Singaporean host, who was acting as my knowledgable guide, agreed with me and said that part of the reason was that Little Indian is still very much a vibrant Indian community concerned with going about its own business and paying less attention to the trappings and needs of tourists.

Here you will listen to live temple orchestra and wake up the Gods with the priests. You can either join the sunrise Puja at 630am or get there a bit later for another morning Puja at 8am. The tenple is filled with quiet energy and the faces of the gods and celestial beings smiling down on you is deeply moving. The scent of the the fresh flowers, sandalwood and incense also transports you to another plane. I always buy a nice freshly made garland ($10) as an offering to Kali. She will answer your prayers if you come with gentle love offerings. These garlands are freshly made in a little stall opposite the temple or in Bellilos lane. For floral enthusiasts it is wonderful to watch how deftly the garland is strung together with fresh flowers by these humble stall owners. The temple itself is not one of the great granite temples with towering vimanas like the Chola temples in South India. But the sculptural and architectural details are pristine. The faces and postures of all the temple sculptures are the work of a master shilpi from Tamil Nadu. Bring your favourite spiritual text and sit and read it cross legged on the floor of the temple. I have read many passages of Gita and Ramayana here. After thus you should reward yourself with a nice filter coffee and masala dosai at Komala Villas. The shop vendors will slowly open up their shops and the entire street will be infused with sambrani - a very magical feeling. An acknowledgment that material prosperity is rooted in divine blessings. Little India has a very special place in Singapore's Tamil history. This is where many Tamils came from South India and Malaysia and built up business from scratch and preserved a Tamil way of live in the midst of a fast moving modern city filled with skyscrapers. Avoid the malls and walk the little streets filled with shophouses to get a real feel. Early morning there is also Tamil hymns (as opposed to pop music) that is played in the radios of all the little shops to honor the Gods.

Serangoon Rd was a sea of coloured lights seeming to go on forever, it was spectacular. Of course to get the full effect you have to be there at night. We had come to Little India in the afternoon, checked out a temple, walked around and had dinner at the Mustafa Centre. We walked back to Serangoon Rd and was blown away by the lights. We walked up and down the road for a while and found what seemed like a temporary market set back off the road a bit. I'm not sure if it's usually there. Walking through we saw the most incredible womens dresses with heavy gold, silver or coloured embroidery. There were new and vintage and the prices were mostly reasonable considering the work that had gone into them. There were stalls and stalls of them, it was really hard to decide what to buy. There were also other stalls of jewellery, homewares, food, etc.The colours of the dresses, the embroidery design and the fabrics were so beautiful, particularly the vintage dresses. Even though they're over-the-top, gaudy, there was just something about them and even if you didn't wear it, it would make a good wall hanging due to the work in them and the colour. I didn't buy one as I couldn't decide and was at the tail end of my trip with less ready cash to spend. I would like to return during Deepavali though and spend more time in Little India and get one of those superb dresses. There were lots of stalls in the streets with fresh flower garlands, so there were some lovely smells with flowers, incense and food. It was pretty busy around that time but it was worth it and at night it was just a little cooler with a slight breeze.
