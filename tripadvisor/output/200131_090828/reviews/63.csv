What they offer is amazing Asian food at very affordable prices. They are simple but impressive. They also have a great atmosphere with tourists and locals mixing. La Pau Sat was the one closest located to where we were staying and it is incredible.

There is such an array of Asian food and delicacies, it is uip to you what you choose. We visited for dinner 3 times during our stay, such was the food. I had curry one evening, chilli chicken rice another and char sui pork finally. Superb.There are also plenty of bakeries and dessert places for a sweet treat.

We love the satay (outside stalls 7 and 8 are the best) complete with a large jug of beer (sufficient for three beers each at a total of $20), but did find other indoor food, while plentiful option-wise, really disappointing. I watched one vendor making a dish, then later reheating it pre serving. No wonder it was stodgy - rice noodles do not take kindly to being served other than just done. There is an interim hawker stall just down the road heading to Chinatown that we ended up preferring (though not all stalls are open on weekends and holidays). Satay remains outstanding at Lau Pa Sat (thus, my rating), but we won't be back for any other dishes in future.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-31 09:32:46.844211

It is located in the center of financial,commercial district of Singapore surrounded by hundreds of offices.
Octagonal building has 8 radial spokes joining at a central capola with a clock tower. The structure is built using using cast iron columns,arches and roof support imported from England. Central clock tower is open from below showing
4/5 bells ,statue of a boy holding a gong. After a gap of every 15 minutes statue of the boy become animated and ringing the bells.
8 Octagonal redials have open spaces full of hundreds of neatly arranged tables and chairs. Rest of the space is packed with hundreds of food stalls. The food stalls are self service type where you buy your food and take it to any of the tables . There are few restaurants as well with proper enclosures and seating served by waiters .
The food stalls and restaurants serve cuisines from gourmet meals to fast food of the countries around the world.
Generally Lou Pa Sat is quite,with the staff of food stalls and restaurants ,quietly going about their job. Come 1200 noon and suddenly the serene quality is changed by the hub hub and rushing around of hundreds of office goers who congregate there during their lunch break between 1200 noon and 2 PM .
Lou Pa Sat is a place where tourist gather as a place of attraction AND a place where they can have a choice of various types of cuisine . At same time it fulfills the lunch requirement providing fresh and hot meals.
It is unique and unforgettable experience watching Lou Pa Sat in full flow.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-31 09:32:47.612506

Been there few times and the quality of food differs a lot from stall by stall. Definitely would not recommend someone to go on a rainy day.
As the place has its unique view, sitting at the side of the forest of buildings and enjoy the ambience, it is worth visiting at least once.

The Vietnamese stall had also sold out of food and only had soup left. As a place that is supposedly open until 3-4am, was really surprised that these places had sold out by 10pm.

,1,63,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/PappanMajumdar,457287988,05-02-2017,5,The best local cuisine bang in the middle of the central business district!!,"This was my 2nd visit to Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavilion. This is a huge covered building which houses more than 50 food stalls dishing out local and world cuisine. This is a lovely place right in the middle of the Singapore Central Business District (CBD). It is open from all sides. It is octagonal in shape with ornamental pillars. It has historic architecture from the British time. Really a must visit either for lunch or dinner. The best part of this place is that even if it rains, you can sit there and eat while getting a glimpse of the fast-moving corporate life of Singapore. We went for lunch when we saw lots of local people working in CBD coming for lunch. The last time I had gone was for dinner and then it takes a more touristy turn.

Things to keep in mind/tips/recommendations:

1. How to reach - by bus you have to get down at 1, Raffles Quay bus stop. By MRT you have to go to Promenade MRT (Circle Line).

2. There are many stalls including Indian ones. It is like a jigsaw puzzle and you can lose your sense of direction as every side looks the same! You have world cuisine also. So, you can find anything and everything under one roof. There are only a few liquor stalls, so you have to literally go around and find them.

3. This place is awesome. It has those giant ceiling fans which just adds to the charm of the place. The historic architecture, the setting, the open sided from all sides makes this place really worth it to visit once. And then the place is a flat one storey structure which is surrounded in all directions by tall commercial buildings of the CBD area. It is really unique.

4. About the quality of food, nothing home to write about. But, we are not experts in finding the right place/stall. I guess you need to know which stalls are famous and have very good food. I saw some stalls which had lots of newspaper reviews being shown off. I also saw one particular stall which had these reviews and then many Uber Eats personnel waiting to pick up food. So, my guess is that there are some stalls there which dish out very famous food. But, how to find them, don't ask me. Maybe it is available on the net or maybe you have to ask a few locals.

5. Places nearby - You have Merlion Park which is just 1 bus stop away. So, after having lunch here, we hopped across to Merlion Park to see the famous Singapore Lion statue which spits out water into the sea. It is also very near the famous Gardens By The Bay (just 2-3 bus stops away). The Singapore Flyer is also right next door. So, a visit to any of these places can be planned with a visit to Lau Pa Sat.

This is a highly recommended place in Singapore. Something unique and you will not be disappointed. More than the food, it is the place which you must see and experience.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-31 09:32:56.109108

It houses many stalls selling different types of singapore and world cuisine. In the evening, it does get really busy. My suggestion if you visit Lau Pa Sat is to wander around and check the different stalls. Don't go with the people who offer you stuff as they tend to be quiet pricey.

The other being infamous one is Newton (bbq stingray). Lots of choices of food here but not the cheapest food court in town...

In Singapore, buy your own tissues, sit at a rocky stool on the street outdoors or indoors, enjoy the hustle and bustle of the atmosphere. This is what a hawker street style is like. It doesn't get more authentic than this.

I've rated it very good because of the food and atmosphere.

Cleanliness is Singapore standard, higher than most Asian countries but not the typical clean western style food courts.

Skewers seem to be the number one seller - I’m talking a tray of 50-60 skewers with shrimp, chicken, beef, lamb, and pork (if you go to the Chinese sellers). It looked amazing, but I was really irritated by people trying to sell us their food or to go to their stall. I enjoy perusing for what to eat in peace and not rushed, thank you.

Also, as a Westerner, I expect certain things when I eat - like napkins and a clean eating space. Nope, they don’t exist. Once you order your food, they are gone and they won’t look twice at you again.

Starting it's life as a wet market and now a ""modern hawker centre"" with a catchy name ""Festival Pavilion"". But to us, it will always be known as ""Lau Pa Sat"" which literally means ""old market"" in Fujianese dialect.

Lunch is usually crowded due to the sheer number of offices in the surrounding area. Unique to Singapore for the ""seat booking"" system whereby a call card or tissue packs (sometimes other objects like and umbrella) will be place on the table when it gets crowded. So for any tourists going to any foodcourts or hawker centre in Singapore for the first time, that means seats are taken.

Many food options to choose from here with local fare to even some Latin American food as well as other South East Asian, Japanese, Korean, South Asian (Indian) and even western food. In the evening, all the satay stalls opens and the crowd will be slightly different from the lunch crowd. Happy hour for a few pints of beer and supper for the late owls.

Economical, tasty and loads to choose from but we just wish more of the old charm of the market remains which unfortunately part of it's charm has been somewhat lost after the renovation to modernize it.

Satay is 70 cents per, but there is a minimum buy of 10 satay sticks, so really 7 SGD. They are good, but, for me the real reason to come back and back again is the roti dude at the end of the street.

All the rotis are made by hand right there.... and it's truly magical. The resulting roti is flakey, hot, and fluffy. It's amazing. There are three versions, plain with curry dipping sauce, egg, and banana. We have eaten all three, and I like the original best.

It's not just a venue for the working crowd by day and delicious satay by night. The structure is one of the oldest evidence of a marketplace in Singapore from the early colonial period.

There are very few places in Singapore where we could find Victorian cast-iron elements and bronze bells with a jacquemart crafted in Europe. It also has an iconic clock tower and distinctive high-ceilinged octagonal structure with eight radial passageways.

Now to the late night satay. One of the lanes was transformed into a pedestrian walkway and open-air seating dotted by a line of satay stalls. We were informed that they generally open around 7pm and operate till 12am. The rest of the hawker centre is opened in the day. The crowd had thinned as the night grew long.

There were many stalls to patronage and everyone has their favorites or recommendations. We finally decided on Stall 8 for a taste test of its mutton and tripe. The mutton were skiner slivers of meat but it was well marinated with sweet and charred flavors. The larger portions of tripe was equally charred with a chewy texture.

Malay.Indian,Chinese, Vegetarian can all be found under the magnificent Iron Lace Pagoda or if you like Satay then dining in ""Satay Street"" in the evening is a really tasty and fun experience. I would recommend ""Best Satay No 7 & 8"" who have proven consistency and are reasonably priced. A selection of Beef,Chicken and Prawn satay sticks and a jug of Tiger Beer can be enjoyed for under S$40.00 for 2 people and while not as cheap as some Hawker style dining option in Singapore is still great value for the experience. If sitting outside in Satay Street a man comes round selling packets of tissues/wet wipes for S$2-$3 , very useful when you have finished the satay and if you leave them on the table when you go to get a drink etc. if is a sign that someone is sitting there and reserves you spot.
(A tip when dining at any street style stall in Singapore is to always look for the Food Hygiene Standards rating certificate - A , B,C, D and it is recommended to only eat from A or B rated stalls.)

We didn't know one from another and they all seemed to look the same so went with the first who nabbed us, No 6. The satay took a while to arrive but we were plied with cheap beer in the meantime.
It cost S$21 for 30 (very small) sticks of mixed satay and a beer. That was plenty for 2 people.
The smell of the satay when they put it in front of us was divine - smoky, caramelized and mouth watering. Unfortunately the satay was cold and the meat was really tough. We were very disappointed but would still come again and try another stall.
This is a fun, cheap place to eat and we'd definitely give it another go.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 09:35:47.186601

Got a taxi ($10 from our hotel so don't bother getting all hot and sweaty walking!)
Wandered through the Lau Pa Sat Festival pavilion enjoying the smells of all the various cuisines on offer before heading towards the back of the pavilion to where all the satay stalls are situated. You can't miss them, just follow your nose.
There are loads of various stalls all numbered and the prices are much the same.
We chose stall 7 ( bypass the touts as you can never be sure which stall holder they are touting for and approach your chosen stall holder yourself).
Find a place to sit close by , lots to chose from. We ordered the bundle of 10 chicken satay sticks, 10 beef and 6 jumbo prawns. We also ordered a pitcher of beer which was I guess equivalent to about 2 pints as I had 2 glasses and my husband about 2+.
Just watching the satay being cooked is an experience in itself.
The satay arrived sizzling hot and accompanied by little cubes of cucumber, raw onion and 2 good sized bowls of satay sauce for dipping. The satays were $26 and the beer $19.

It is located on Anson rd, and not far from Telok Ayer station. Whilst open all the time the evening meal is the time to go. Outside are the satay stalls. Cooks sweating over their grills with foot high flames. The satays are cheap (70c) and you can individually or in any size bundle you wish. From there you wander inside to all the stalls. This is where the hard part starts. There are so many choices you will spend some time searching for what you wish to eat. We recommend buying a dish and sharing one at a time, and trying as many as you can eat. The budget will not suffer, as food is cheap. The Dim Sum stall has prawn dumplings to die for. The Indian curry and naan bread also was great. Really all the food is good, and you can’t go wrong. Most meals are about the $4 mark, Dim Sum cheaper.

I wanted to have sambal stingray and satay, so I guessed it should be a good place.
I walked around inside the beautiful pavilion and found this seafood shop (Boon Tat street) outside. Since I was alone so I just made it here easy for me.
I asked for a small portion of sambal stingray, oysters with garlic sauce. I also asked the shop to order beef & mutton satay for me.
For me, it was convenient that I didn't have to walk around and order stuff I wanted.
And the food was pretty good. I was satisfied with the bbq stingray. Oysters with garlic sauce were very good! Satay (beef & mutton) was average though, the peanut sauce could be better. But I didn't know which stall these satay were from.
I wanted to go back later for more choices of food but I didn't have time.

The Lau Pa Sat stands uniquely in the midst of all of modern day Singapore
Lau Pa Sat

I went in and started looking at the food options there. The usual Chinese food was there, the Indian Vegetarian food was there and well the Halal food stalls were there too. The thing that I have really enjoyed about South East Asia is the Food Courts/ Centres that are almost everywhere, the choices are vast and great and the prices are pretty nominal. Lau Pa Sat was no different, there were great choices of food and the prices were pretty decent as well. The Food court is in itself a piece of Singapore’s heritage. Initially, the market was built somewhere else and then moved to this location around 1894 or so, and then as all things in Singapore, was renovated/removed/rebuilt, but cared for as a symbol of their heritage.

One of the many food stalls and dining areas of Lau Pa Sat
As you enter the building which is open from 8 sides (an octagon in shape) the first thing you notice is the beautiful steel beams and the massive fans. The victorian feeling of the building has remained intact though the number of tables and chairs on the floor make it very crowded and un-victorian.

The building has a clock tower in the centre complete with a jacquemart (a bell ringer) that rings the bells. I couldn't get a good picture of it.

The bell ringer and the bells.
After appreciating the structure and its colonial past, it was then time to enjoy the food. I looked around and found this stall with a big Halal sign on it (even though there were other Halal stalls ). Since it was the biggest Halal sign it was a sign and that was the place I was going to have my dinner at :)
Most of the food stalls in Singapore have a sign showing their category. The category is usually A or B (i didn’t see a C), which basically tells you the price point. So this stall was a category B stall. Looking at all the chicken rice dishes , chicken rice it was. The cost was a mere 4 SGD.
My usual food stall with the variety of chicken rice
The food was alright, I kinda enjoyed it as I was absolutely hating the junk food.

the 4 SGD chicken rice set
The Set had soup, rice chicken. The serving size was just enough, the taste was good. So for the next couple of days on and off I enjoyed a variety of chicken rice.
Once you had finished there was always someone to pick up your plates and thats where I saw something very interesting. The Halal dishes were separate from the non Halal ones. On the side of the market was the washing area for the dishes and interestingly there the Halal and non-Halal washing areas were separate too. That indeed was quite considerate.

The Dish washing area of Lau Pa Sat
Outside Lau Pa Sat are these Satay stalls. Lots of them with lots of Satay. I thought about trying but then I just couldn’t convince my self enough. Plus the hustling in that area was something you don’t see in Singapore.",09-2016,Solo,2020-01-31 09:37:08.506968

These came a few minutes later with two polystyrene containers of peanut sauce, a block of rice cake and a smattering of raw onions/cucumber.

One dish will cost you $4-10.

Why though?,"Some review says this is the biggest food court in Singapore? No even slightly close. Another claims this is conveniently next to Orchard. Google Maps, the whole of Singapore and I would disagree. One complains there is no air-con, another of being harassed by stall owners. While not wrong in statement, wrong on so many levels of sentiment.

I'll try to clear it up.

In the middle of the financial district a few blocks back from the marina is Lau Pa Sat. The closest MRT is Raffles Place, exit I. That is the letter between H and J. Either way, every local will know and will lonely point you. They have to by law. Inside the olde pavillion is your regular hawker fair, although slightly more expensive than elsewhere - you see a high proportion of tourist customers, which could explain the prices, or maybe the location . Also because the real reason to go here is because the road is closed to traffic after 7pm as it becomes, as it affectionately known, 'Satay Street'. Kinda fun, mostly tourists and locals hosting business buddies. $20 jugs of Tiger beer, a sense of humour and not growing up wrapped in cotton wool should help you from feeling harassed. They are doing their job and won't bother you. What's up with people? Seriously. How do you get dressed in the morning? Life is so easy.",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-31 09:38:55.159332

This a huge place with several outlets & common sitting similar to a non-aircon food court which remains open almost throughout the day (and night). It is central to Singapore & stone’s throw away from most of the famous banks & offices adjacent to Robinson road & walking distance from Raffles place MRT (exit F). The sea front too is walking distance.
Food is variety of items which means all sorts of local food, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Vietnamese, Filipino, Korean, Japanese, Vegetarian, sea food etc. You just name it.
There is a convenience store (Cheers) & few enclosed aircon places as well if you fancy a bit of exclusivity.

The prices may be slightly higher than the local neighborhoods but it's still decent pricing. There is the Lau Pa Sat in the street that starts at 7pm every night. I think this is more in reference to the pavilion. I do recommend the street satay although they stalls are pushy and so annoying. But inside the pavilion, there is everything from the typical Indian, Dumplings, Drink Stalls, Carrot Cake, and all those stalls. But it also has so many more cuisines. I can't remember them all but I do remember seeing many kinds that I haven't seen anywhere else such as Costa Rican. But the one stall that I highly recommend is the Thunder Rice stall and order the number 1. I think that's about it. I kind of want to knock down the rating because I hate being heckled. There will be people constantly putting napkins in your face wanting to buy them. I hate it because they get in your face and disrupt the conversation at your table. And also the street satay people are so aggressive that it's annoying. Like if I don't look at you or your stall, leave me alone. I won't go into details but let's just say that it's ridiculous all the situations for which I was heckled to buy satay (like if I'm carrying satay, then I don't want more. Why would they heckle me if I already have it). Anyways, I do love the food and I will probably get Thunder Rice on every visit to this place. If you do satay in the street at 7pm, you might be able to walk down to Marina Bay for the 8pm light show which I highly recommend.

I was at first hesitant to try Lau Pa Sat because of this; and, also, because I am extremely squeamish. I do not like street food, much less, open space food stalls along the streets. So when my friend told me this is a hawker centre, I almost immediately said no.

BUT I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.

First, it caters to so many different cuisines, that even the pickiest eater like me will find something to eat. Second, the food tastes so good! I didn't expect them to be that flavourful, after being here for nearly 2 months. As almost everyone here is health-conscious, the cuisines here are usually less sweet or less salty as what I am used to. But in Lau Pa Sat, everything tastes as how I remember them from their origin countries! Authentic, tasty and really, really sumptuous!

It may not be a luxury place and yes, it's open along the streets but it's a whole lot cleaner than the other hawker centres I've been brought to by my friends and colleagues, this one is so clean and also comfortable enough that my friend and I sat there for hours chatting the evening away as though we were hanging out at a café or quaint coffee shop!

Bonus : if you happen to be price-conscious, Lau Pa Sat offers sufficient food serving at really cheap prices, than if you eat at a restaurant.

And you can even mix-and-match your meal just the way you want -- perhaps, a Japanese Katsu Don for your main meal, with a side of Tonkotsu Ramen and 4 pieces of Chinese Siew Mai Dimsum? Then for your second round, try out the local Chicken Rice, followed by Indian Curry and discover the taste of a Costa Rican chimichurri? Then get some Korean bingsu for dessert and several orders of fruit shakes from the centermost stall :)

Really, it's a place that will meet any type of tourist's wants and needs! And this is coming from someone who often cannot find a thing to eat, even in the buffet meals of luxury hotels.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 09:39:43.039714

My fave is stall 8 where the meats are a perfect blend of choice skewers of meat wtih the right amount of fat to keep them from drying out. When choosing which stall, feel free to ask to test the peanut sauce of each stall, they'll be happy to let you sample this vital condiment.

I love the mix of chicken, beef and pork but always steer clear of the prawn satay. They are NOT fresh and cooked from frozen and inevitably taste bland and mushy. PS. never ask the Beer girls for glasses of beer, which will never appear, only jugs as that's what they want you to buy. You'll need it anyway in steamy Singapore.
