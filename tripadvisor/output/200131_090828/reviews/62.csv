1. One of the largest libraries in Asia, 7 (or more) floors of books which are hard to find elsewhere.
2. Central location is great for meeting up with friends.
3. It has a mini-theatre space called the Black Box, a great space to support local arts and performances.
4. It also has unique exhibitions sometimes, most are free.
5. Study room is perfect for students, it has vending machines available for those study hunger pangs and...
6. Right outside the study room there is an outdoor rooftop garden! Great for catching some fresh air in between study blocks.

and now that we have kids...

7. The children's library at the basement is definitely one of the prettiest and most awesome, with a treehouse made up upcycled materials set up for the little readers, and a plethora of books to choose from, and in so many languages too, and literally books for all ages (from age zero!). Plenty of space and the clean carpets meant the little ones can enjoy reading at any corner of this children's library.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-31 09:27:58.318996

Most floors had well organised lending sections and reference sections. I dont know whether the book sections are unique in that they have to cater for three different languages, but they appear to do it well.
However, the highlight of our visit was the upper floors of the library which was, in fact, a museum highlighting the development of Singapore island from the very early years. Information was well presented and informative.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-31 09:28:16.601898

The actual branch component of the library, secreted away in the basement, is nothing special but the upper floors compose one of the best Research Libraries on Southeast Asia in the world (and their collection of non-SE Asian material is also quite good).

It is a Research Library, so you can't check out any of the books. And it is Singapore, so there are lots of rules about where to sit, photocopying materials, bags and so on and so forth. But their collection of audio-visual material, magazines, periodicals and books is extensive. Not everything is on display, so if you are really doing a deep dive into some back-issue of Indonesia Moeda from 1931 or something, you'll have to check with the friendly and knowledgeable staff.

The design is all floor-to-ceiling windows which give pretty great views of the City (partially obstructed by some neighboring high-rises). On the 16th floor they often host special events in the POD, which require pre-registration. You take a separate elevator up, and it is basically a glass-walled pod giving you breath-taking 360 degree views of the city. If you have the time, I would recommend you check out an event at the POD, but the Library also hosts hundreds of other events for braniacs all the time so check their website or Facebook page. There is even a Drama Centre, but I have never personally been to see a show.

During school periods it is often filled with little nerd kids studiously working, which should tell you something about the culture and society of Singapore. In Los Angeles, libraries are usually filled with homeless people, but in Singapore it's where kids come to hang out and get nerdy.",05-2017,Solo,2020-01-31 09:30:26.359893

I'm not exaggerating, this library is my favorite place not only in Singapore, but on earth. I always feel at ease in this place. You could find any updated collection by your interest in all of Singaporean's languages. My personal favorite is the English art book section. Although, it's pretty crowded for a library during college's final exam period.

Outside the book sections, the corridors and hallways are very spacious, you could find students doing various assignments along the way.

When I first came here in September 2016, I stumbled across a historical exhibition in the 10th floor and I gotta say, the best literary exhibition I've ever been to.

Another thing I love about this establishment are the free lockers. I was backpacking and stayed at some acquaintances who were working by the day so I had no places to put my belongings. Thankfully I found this place and I put them all in these lockers. Although, mind you the lockers are only available as long as the library's open, and they would sweep out everything in the lockers in the night. Nevertheless, it's pretty handy for urban traveller. And also, the locker is fairly small. I had to separate my belongings into small bags to 3 different lockers.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 09:31:53.703186
