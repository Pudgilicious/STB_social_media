Housed in what was an old school building, the Peranakan Museum was an easy - through sweaty - walk from the City Hall MRT station. Entry was a very affordable S$9 each (concession) for a senior and a student giving access to all the galleries, special exhibit Gambar (Malay word for photos) and a guided tour. We forwent the tour and decided to wander around by ourselves.

The exhibits were pretty static, housed as they were in glass cases or displayed behind roped off areas. The descriptions were illuminating, through this senior found the small font in the waist high plaques difficult to read, particularly in the diffuse lighting.

Despite this, they were fabulous props to explain Peranakan culture. And it was very evident that this museum is a labour of love and passion with a huge number of exhibits donated by prominent Peranakan families.

Our familial ties to Peranakan ways and culture are rather weak as the passion for the old ways was just not there, especially among the younger generations. The Great Grands, and Grands were tie-dyed Peranakan especially in their dressing and speech. But by my Mum’s generation, the women were all working for the then colonial British organisations, speaking English and in frocks and heels. No embroidered tops, sarongs and beaded slippers in sight!

A wander through the museum evoked waves of memories from my childhood of the rituals, customs, furniture, kitchen tools (like the huge granite spice grinders Grandmother used before the advent of the modern food processors), crockery, clothing, jewellery, accessories etc etc And also thoughts of “Hmmm I wonder what happened to Grandmother’s / Great-grand Aunty’s ... or I wonder who that was given to ....” plus, of course, “I have that, that and that ... from (this and that relative)” - all very precious, but impractical for everyday bar the most special occasions, unfortunately.

What I thought really well done was the display of the life cycle, from birth to weddings and funerals, which made it easier for princess to get a better understanding of Peranakan rituals.

This museum is well worth a few hours for those who would like an understanding of the term Peranakan and the history behind the unique Peranakan fusion cooking enjoyed throughout Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia.

There is a tiny museum shop stuffed chock-full of Peranakan themed souvenirs beside the entrance if you want a momentous of your visit. We didn’t buy any as I have a small collection of authentic vintage items at home.

For those who would like to recreate authentic Peranakan dishes without the tedious hours of my great-grandmother’s and grandmother’s days, I suggest you seek out a copy of Modern Nonya cookbook by Sylvia Tan. This is the cookbook I refer to for authentic dishes simplified for the time-poor.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:37:02.646179

LOCATION: it's in the city center, so easy to reach also with public transport (especially green/red line MRT).

PLACE: the building in which the museum resides was a school for more or less 100 years, so already this building sets the scene for what you are going to see inside.

EXPERIENCE: we knew it was possible to get a volunteer to guide our visit (please check on the internet the hours of the slots if you are interested) so we approached the staff at the desk on the groudfloor and they smilingly asked us to wait for a while at the designated area. Then after a few minutes the guide arrived and accompanied us in all the rooms, explaining the history and every-day life of this specific culture. Very nice indeed! Another very good feature was that the kids had their own maps where you could get stamps onto in each room: these kept the little folks entertained as we were!

Gorgeous old building and rickety floor boards! The staff were helpful and friendly.

The actual displays were fabulous. My son learned a lot about funerals and weddings from the displays. I felt incredibly teary at the photos at the entrance. Such pride in one's culture is a beautiful thing.

A rich and well preserved photographic exhibition was on the 2nd and 3rd floors. Each photo gave a literal snap shot of life for the Peranakan in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Stretched from the early days of photography, all the way to the current era. The film showing the cleaning of some items was incredibly interesting.

Many exhibits have been donated by the Peranakan community leaders or members from Malacca, Penang and not forgetting Singapore itself.

On display were many interesting items which have been very well maintained and preserved over hundreds of years, things like silver dinnerware, antique crockery & utensils dating back to the Ming & Ching dynasties in China, mother-of-pearl laden furniture, heavy bedroom and matrimonial sets, ceremonial attires & the womenfolk's dressing accessories, photographs and many other fascinating exhibits. The exhibits and artefacts are spread over 3 floors accessible by staircases and also an elevator at the back part of the building.

I was made to understand that this museum is being run by the government and an entrance fee of $10 is charged per adult. It is an interesting stopover for any visitor to Singapore and you could easily spend an hour or two to browse through the numerous items and intricacies found there.

The building was formerly Tao Nan School, and was refurbished extensively to become the Peranakan Museum. There are three storeys of exhibits, showing how the Peranakans are widespread not just in Singapore, but also in the region, their culture, food, architecture and so on. Many Peranakans have made significant contributions to the communities they live in, and many aspects of their culture are a fusion of the Chinese and Malay cultures. Because most of them are wealthy, the possessions they have highlight their wealth very well. For example, the porcelain wares they use (and give away in marriages), the exquisite furniture and their decorative elements, are just two examples.

I was glad our boys weren't with us. They did have some hands-on exhibits for kids, but they were all broken, stolen or missing. It was mostly cases of things to look at with long explanations on placards. As an adult, that's what I expect from a 'museum'. But this is not for kids.

It's a small museum - especially given that, I've never seen so many security guards. Not even at the British Museum or the V&A. It's a bit off-putting to have them follow you around and hover over you. Everything's in glass cases; it's not like we were going to lift the exhibits.

Even for adults, it's pretty dry. I do feel like I have a better understanding of some of the aspects of Peranakan art and life in the early 20th century. But we spent about an hour and a half there and I didn't feel like I needed much more time. There's not much interactive and even the descriptions are dull.

I've seen what the creative staff here in Singapore can do at places like the Aquarium - it's clear they hired a staff with a very different approach to create the displays here, and it's sad. We did not partake of the guided tour as we came late and had limited time. We did overhear part of it and it did sound like it would brighten the experience and breathe a bit of life into the learning.

They became traders, lawyers, doctors and other professionals. The Peranakans were and continue to be a mélange of cultures with Chinese dominant.

Apparently, it used to be a school, and the renovation (including sealing off for air-conditioning and modernising the lighting) looked pretty comfortable.

The museum pieces & curating were pretty good -- covered different facets of the life (marriage, funerals, ancestor worship, religion, food, needlework, furniture) but without being having too many pieces on display -- the lighting & spacing of the pieces were pretty good too, but the upper floor of the annex part of the needlework might have benefitted from a bit more lights.

Set aside at least 60 minutes for the exhibits, and maybe more if you want to snoop around the building.

Descriptions (personally didn't leave enough time to join the guided tour) were relatively detailed & nuanced. Could have been interesting to see information on how some of the nonyaware were made -- in particular how the colouring was achieved. If readers want to go deep about it, the Museum of Asian Civilisations down the quay had a ceramic exhibit showcasing mainland Chinese earthenware & stoneware pieces which did not have the raw materials to give the finished ceramic pieces, as here, the kind of glaze and background colours which 19th century and early 20th century nonyaware had. Notes about how these materials were produced (the industrial engineering behind it, so to speak) would have given yet another separate dimension to appreciate the spread of the artisanal & industrial techniques, the fashions & patterns, the clan/lineage networks between the mainland and SE Asia, etc.",04-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 10:40:39.231344

The first level is the story of their origins - how they ended up in Singapore from different parts of China and India. It also gives you a broad view of what life was like for them - the kinds of elaborate wedding gifts that they received, their jewellery, their intricately beaded slippers. Another highlight is the giant portraits of faces of different Peranakans and their quotes on what it means for them to identify with their ethnicity.

The second level is devoted to their wedding ceremony - including the kinds of costumes that they wear during this 12-day celebration, their wedding crowns and jewelry, information on their peculiar superstitions (apparently a boy had to roll around in their bed before the couple's wedding night to ensure that they will get a son), their elaborately carved wedding bed and more.

The third level is about their daily life, religion, and mourning practices where you'll see a typical Peranakan kitchen, the gods that they worshipped (a unique mixture of Chinese and Indian gods and ancestor worship) on their beautifully carved altars, and an example of a coffin bed and what they wore during the entire mourning process (including a sack cloth at the end of the mourning period).

There are so many beautiful things inside this museum - hopefully, you'll learn to appreciate their gaudy, elaborate, extravagantly colourful aesthetic sensibility which comes out in their many multi-coloured and multi-carved jewelry, spittoons, furniture and other beautiful pieces.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 10:40:47.567021

In the end, I find the original message and definition that were offered when you enter the museum have been undermined completely.

I understand the desire to expand the definition of peranakan to include the different ethnic groups and to present a harmonious and wholesome view of the heritage of Singapore that reflects the cultural make up of today's Singapore. I suppose that is the purpose of the series of large photographs of peranakan Singaporeans of different ages, most of them credited with a pretentious and/or ambiguous statement about what it means to be peranakan. It was almost a breath of fresh air when I came to the photograph of a man credited with saying he does not ""feel"" peranakan; he just feels--or something to that effect.

Beyond the first galleries, the exhibits limited their focus completely to the Chinese peranakan, specifically the Hokkien (Fujian) peranakan--probably the predominant peranakan group in Singapore. While it was interesting to see objects in the exhibit--wedding and funerary objects, clothing, dinner ware--I kept thinking about the central theme presented in the first gallery: What is a peranakan? I do not think those objects are what make one a Hokkien peranakan, let alone a general peranakan.

Ultimately for me, the lack of exploration of the ""why's"" --to use a simple example: Why did a young Fujianese woman suddenly decide that it was a good idea to wear sarong and kebaya?--makes the experience feel utterly incomplete and superficial.",08-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 10:40:56.851369

I'll recommend that you visit if you're in town for a few days and want to know about the history of the Straits Chinese in the south east Asian region. Prior to the British colony days, Singapore was already an important port of call for international traders including the Chinese. The intermarriage between the indigenous peoples with the Chinese and even Indians (perhaps less represented in SG mainstream media) produced the Straits Chinese and peranakans.

I stayed two hours here in all. The artifacts are not as many as I'd thought would be collected so I'm somewhat disappointed. I think the important facet of peranakan food could have been better displayed and presented. The display for the prominent peranakan VIPs was also awkwardly done up, with information panels all over the place and lacking in pictures. I had to crane my neck to read.

For me, the biggest attraction about this place is the Nonya handicraft but very often, I find that the lighting is too dim for visitors to appreciate the fine beadwork.

In addition, some exhibits were not in working order. So that was kind of disappointing for those who wished to listen to a typical conversation by a Nonya.

I also liked how there was a gallery devoted to famous Peranakans -- so many females made their mark! The guard in the kitchen area spent time explaining to me -- an American -- how this kitchen was what his home looked like when he was growing up. He was proud to take the time pointing out items of interest, explaining how this was the woman's domain (men daren't enter!). I'm not certain how many Americans enter this museum, and many others wandering the gallerys often didn't speak much English, but the Peranakans who were there were proud of their heritage and didn't mind doing a bit of bragging. Definitely recommend stopping in and spending a few hours. Do not miss the gift shop.

Because this museum was then going to be closed very soon for rennovations, I joined a group of six people visiting the museum in early April. The exhibits revealed to me at least, in a sparing way how some of the immigrant Chinese embraced and in a sense made their own, some of the practices of the indigenous Malays. They were also pictures of some former British colonial officers.

What emerged from the collection of exhibits is a revealing history of the not too distant past and the coming close to each other, or, even of the intermingling of some Asian cultures, laced with European or British influences, on the fringes. A visit to this museum is worth every minute spent to behold the varied collections of events, individuals, objects, etc.

Reason being it showcases quality stuff of the Peranakan community, which is fast disappearing due to the effects of modernisation.

Just a short word about the Peranakan community for those unfamiliar with this sub-cultural group, who are found mainly in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. I quote from Wikipedia: ""Peranakan Chinese or Straits-born Chinese are the descendants of Chinese immigrants who came to the Malay archipelago including British Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, where they are also referred to as Baba-Nyonya) and Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia; where they're also referred as Kiau-Seng) between the 15th and 17th centuries.

""While the term Peranakan is most commonly used to refer to those of Chinese descent also known as Straits Chinese (named after the Straits Settlements; 土生華人 in Chinese; Tionghoa-Selat or Tionghoa Peranakan in Indonesian; Phuket Baba among Thais in Phuket, Thailand), there are also other, comparatively smaller Peranakan communities, such as Indian Hindu Peranakans (Chitty), Arab/Indian Muslim Peranakans (Jawi Pekan) (Jawi being the Javanised Arabic script, Pekan a colloquial contraction of Peranakan) and Eurasian Peranakans (Kristang = Christians of Portuguese and Asian ancestry). The group has parallels to the Cambodian Hokkien, who are descendants of Hoklo Chinese, and the Pashu of Myanmar, a Burmese word for the Peranakan or Straits Chinese who have settled in Myanmar. They maintained their culture partially despite their native language gradually disappearing a few generations after settlement.""

The Peranakan Museum has very good exhibits of artefacts that give a good representation of what Peranakan life was like during its heyday - from the kitchen to the bedroom, wedding to funeral, dress and customs.

Currently on show is an exhibition of beadwork and embroidery. They are simply impressive. Besides using multi-coloured silk and gold threads to embroider table cloths, handkerchiefs, wedding banners, shoes, handbags, table runners and so on, their women, who are called ""nyonyas"" use colourful minuscule glass beads (the best I am told were from Venice, Italy and the tinier the beads the better the pieces will be regarded, especially by demanding mothers and mother-in-laws) to richly embellish their handiworks. Many hours of painstaking work done by the nyonyas have produced the exquisite pieces now on display at the museum. They have to be seen to be fully appreciated and marvelled at.

*I have personally witnessed the stringing of the tiny glass beads to embroider women shoe tops called kasut manek-manek by my late aunts and mother to know how much skill, work and time is involved.

The exhibition ends on 26 March 2017.

I gained a better understanding of the culture and wonderful 'melting pot' of nationalities and races that is the modern Singapore that we know today. It is with such a sense of pride that their heritage and traditions are explained. The Peranakans have a strong sense of tolerance and respect for their land and culture that is to be commended. It wouldn't have been easy to assimilate with so many different races and ideals, but they seemed to have done so great success. Thank you for such a wonderful insight to a part of your history.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:43:18.361409

We were there for under two hours and it was such a memorable experience for her that she is still mesmerized by the intricacies, colour and glory of this wonderful culture.
We were there on a Sunday and no payment was required of visitors (Singaporeans go in for free). But they often have these free times - although a donation would, of course, be welcome.
A pity that a restaurant or snack bar would be too cumbersome because a taste of the food would have been the decoration on the icing of the cake.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:43:18.742797
