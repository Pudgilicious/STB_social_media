Kampung Glam itself is very famous for both locals and foreigners. Its kampong-like surroundings attract people to wander around, making it one of Singapore's top tourist destinations.

It's really a contrast as compared to other modern parts of Singapore, worth-experiencing therefore.

Sultan Mosque is actualy a part of Singapore's Royal House. They were both constructed by British colonial power in around circa 1824 for the Sultan allowed it to build a trading outpost in Singapore.

The mosque surroundings are very attracted, dotted with vintage Malay buildings and mysterious alleys, where people sit in and eat at, relaxing, especially during weekends.

Tourists mostly from China, Japan, South Korea, European countries, and Indonesia flock the mosque, whose architecture is so unique and charming.

Cars are prohibited to pass by, hence making it really safe for children to roam free.

Restaurants of all sorts are abundantly available. The most popular among other are Hj. Maemunah Malay restaurant and Derwish Turkish restaurant.

It is also called Masjid Sultan. The history of the mosque goes back to 1824 when a brick structure was erected in honour of the Sultan Hussein Shah, the first Sultan of Singapore. In the 1920s the mosque was rebuilt with designs by Denis Santry. The new mosque took on the Saracenic style with traditional domes.

,1,48,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,648844624,29-01-2019,5,"Impressive, Historic, and Hospitable","The Sultan Mosque is impressive in its architecture, historic in its connection to the birth of modern Singapore, and hospitable to non-Muslim TA readers who’d be interested in going inside.

Architecture: Kampong Glam is dominated by the Sultan Mosque’s huge tri-part golden dome (a finial at the very top, a huge onion dome at the bottom, and a lotus decoration connecting the two). Upon closer inspection, you’ll see that these elements are recapitulated in the chhatris (umbrellas) on top of small pavilions on either side of the dome. And the chhatri-pavilions are found again, on top of each of the minarets flanking the mosque. The rest of the mosque, from the dome’s drum down to street level, is primarily bone-white trimmed with brick-red flourishes. It’s a distinctive type of architecture developed by Victorian Brits during the heyday of the Raj, which you often encounter in India. Architectural historians argue about what to call such architecture, but I’m backing Neo-Mughal as the most apt. You can see the same combination of giant dome, flanking chhatris, and elevated chhatris atop the minarets, at the Taj Mahal. The mosque is one of the most imposing landmarks in Singapore, a city full of striking sights. (See Sultan Mosque, Dome and Chhatris, and Minaret photos). I was once lucky enough to get a photo of the mosque’s dome and western minaret topped by a crescent contrail (see Crescent Contrail photo). I never was there at the right time to get one of the dome topped by a crescent moon (actually, contrary to popular belief in the West, the crescent moon is not a symbol of Islam, which has no symbols.)

History: The “Sultan” bit refers to Sultan Hussein Shah. Hussein, the eldest son of the Sultan of Johore, had the misfortune of being trapped downwind of Johor by contrary monsoons when his father died. But it’s an ill monsoon that does no good, and that delay left the field open for a younger half-brother to seize the throne, with Dutch backing. Which in turn gave the British a splendid opportunity to sponsor Hussein as the rightful sultan of Johore, and give him a small fortune in exchange for his signature on a document transferring a wee bit of real estate on the island of Singapura to them. Hussein wound up becoming Sultan of Johore, as well as quite rich. The British got Singapore, already had Penang and Malacca, and then step-by-step got the rest of Malaya. Even the younger half-brother didn’t do too badly, becoming a sultan in a small way over some turf within the Dutch sphere of influence. Hussein spent most of the rest of his life in a grand new palace in Kampong Glam, and built a royal mosque nearby with classic Malayan architecture (not at all like the current mosque). Sir Stamford Raffles contributed $3,000 to help fund the construction (either the Spanish dollars used for the China trade or the Marie Theresa thalers universally used by Arab traders; if the latter, Raffles donated 165 lbs or so of fine silver, which would now be worth a bit over S$50,000; which was worth a lot more back then, when convict labour worked for free).

A mosque on this site thus goes back almost 200 years: ground was broken in 1824, and the job was completed in 1826. One of the curious consequences of building an instant city in a multi-cultural environment, is that lots of different religions date their first place of worship to almost exactly the same time. Singapore’s first Chinese temple, Thian Hock Keng. was established in 1821; a Sufi shrine was established at about the same time for Indian Moslems, and the first Hindu temple in Singapore, Sri Mariamman, was being started as the Sultan Mosque was being finished. Christians were relative late-comers: the Armenians opened their Orthodox church in 1835, and the first St. Andrew’s was completed in 1836. Within a 15-year period, Singapore had acquired its most revered Sunni, Sufi, Buddhist, Hindu, Orthodox and Protestant places of worship. Of course, several of them were improved and updated in the last 200 years, including the Sultan Mosque. The original mosque, dilapidated by the 1930s, was razed, and the one you see today built on the same spot.

Hospitality: In some parts of the world, non-Muslims are strictly prohibited from entering mosques at any time; at Sultan Mosque, you’re cordially welcomed. You can come in anytime between 1000 and 1200 and between 1400 and 1600 on any day of the week except Fridays, when visiting is restricted to 1430-1600. In order to enter the mosque, you have to be dressed properly: for men, that means long-sleeved shirts and full-length trousers; for women, conservative long-sleeved ankle-length dresses: no plunging necklines, translucent fabrics, or provocative form-fitting clothes. And no shoes inside, of course.

On arrival, you’ll be greeted by a charming docent who’ll escort you inside, up to a certain point. Once inside, no talking whatsoever; ask questions before you enter, or after you exit. You can take non-flash photographs, but should not enter either the main or upper prayer halls (see Main Prayer Hall and Main and Upper Halls photos). The prayer halls here look large, but are even more commodious than you’d think. They can hold 5,000 of the faithful. The central prayer hall has an almost tropical feel, with bright white areas and lots of light lime green. The mihrab emphatically stands out, directing your vision in the direction of the Kabaa, and dwarfing the minbar to the right, from which the imam leads the prayers (see Mihrab photo).

My docent was thoroughly charming, and eager to discuss Islam. Setting Farangs straight, as well as Buddhists, Confucians, Hindus and so on, is part of why she’s there. We had a long, and for me, entertaining talk. Q: “Why do women wear head-dresses but men aren’t required to?” A: “A symbol of purity. Besides, whenever I enter Christian churches I always see Mary wearing a hijab, but never see Jesus required to.” Q; “Why don’t women here and in Malaysia and Indonesia wear full burqas, as they do in Afghanistan?” A. “Strictly self-preservation; for Malays, smiling is a huge part of our culture; why, if we couldn’t smile at one another, we’d all die.” That sort of thing. She was impressively good with her banter, with a witty and thoroughly reasonable answer for my every question.

So, you get impressive architecture, an important slice of Singapore history, and a warm welcome, all in one package. True, you don’t get either shopping or dining opportunities, but from where the Sultan Mosque is situated, it’s impossible to get out of Kampong Glam without walking past dozens of those, as well.

p.s. TA asked questions after I completed this. I answered ""yes"" to this attraction requiring ""formal attire"", but that means what I've stated before; if you try to enter with a backless evening gown and a single strand of pearls, you won't be allowed in. TA also asked whether this would be a good hot day, or cold day activity. Temperatures are always tropical here, 365 days a year, so I answered yes to both of them, BUT the better question would have been ""is this a good rainy day activity?"" and the answer to that question is NO: if there's a monsoon downpour go to the National, Art, or Asian Civilizations museums instead; wait for a sunny day to see the dome of the mosque.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 10:46:48.650316

What I can say, is that the call to prayer is something everyone should hear. Everything goes quiet when it starts. Shops turn their music off, people stop talking, birds hush, and everything just stops to listen. It's impossible not to! It's such a spiritual experience. Do yourself a favour and loom up the call to prayer times.

Surrounded by old 2 storey buildings which are protected for its historical value. Not many places like this in Singapore so i recommend you visit. You can enter the mosque outside of prayer times. If you are not decently dressed, the mosque has sarongs you can put on before being allowed in. Hearing the call to prayer is interesting. Some say it gives them an effect just being there hearing it. The interior is calming and cooled by fans. You should also stroll to the old palace and a small museum. 1-2 hours is sufficient for you to get an idea of how Singapore was like in those times.
