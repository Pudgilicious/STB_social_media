We happened to had free tickets for the family to visit the place, that has now turned into an art gallery.

I love walking down some of the rooms and having a feel of what it must have been like in a courtroom. There were all the old treaties that were on display, which me and my husband took our time reading through them and understanding the history of Singapore better.

While the adults enjoyed the time, our kids also had their fair share of fun. There are a lot of activity rooms, such as drawing, digital designing, play rooms for the kids to explore and have fun with.

This is just my third time there and am always blown by the exhibitions. The service is also great. There is basically no 'wrong door' and every service staff at the museum seems to be able to give prompt and accurate information and service to those who are asking.

Went to the Yayoi Kusama exhibitions. Lines were properly managed and mood was light despite some wait time at some installations. Loved the inject of fun by the various museum staff at the entrances to each halls. My kids loved the exhibition though it was admittedly a little hard trying to describe the phallic symbols in her pieces.

First time trying the food at the Courtyard Cafe and was surprised by the standard of the dishes. Ordered the curry chicken and seafood noodles. Curry was spiced to the right amount of spiciness and the taste of coconut was to the right level without being too 'rich' in flavor. Only criticism was that the long beans that were placed in the curry seemed to be an afterthought. Noodles or rather kway teow were cooked through and kids loved the soft texture. Broth was tasty and ingredients were plentiful.

Will love to try Natural Kitchen by Violet Oon the next time there.

We bought the kids packs for $5 each and I was really impressed with them - loads of activities to do and included stickers to use in the obliteration room. I liked how the installations were spread around the gallery so we got a chance to see the amazing architecture and get the kids moving.

We went up to the terrace at the top of the building and had a picnic lunch (probably not allowed but the bar was closed and no staff around to tell us off). Fab views over the City and of that famous hotel with infinity pool.

Some people have mentioned unfriendly staff. All the staff we encountered among the children's installations were really friendly and welcoming. We did get lost a couple of times and walked through the quieter/more traditional areas of the gallery and definitely felt like we should be silent and did get glared at by a couple of members of staff. I actually think this is okay. You can't and shouldn't make everywhere 'kid friendly'. If I had been on my own I would have relished walking around those quiet, well-policed spaces just like libraries and art galleries used to be.

I enjoyed Yayoi Kusama's bold and captivating world of dots, nets, pumpkin, bold play of colors and lights and mirrors. Yayoi is a Japanese artist from New York who exhibits her work to different parts of the world and today we are lucky to enter her unique world of art.
I did enjoy other exhibits on illusions as well, specially the pieces of wood on the floor which appears connected and forms a chair at a certain spot when viewed from a distance.
My favorite Painting is titled "" Picking"" by Wee. The artists work showcased the play of light and shadows so well. I just love it.
One abstract painting that intrigued me though is the Black Afternoon. It was a product of imagination of a student studying abstract art. His painting was inspired the afternoon President Kennedy was shot.
How to get here? Take the City Hall MRT and exit B to St Andrew's Church.

,1,24,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Eushu,493838124,18-06-2017,1,DON'T BRING YOUR KIDS!,"I had a very traumatising time at National Gallery on Sat 17/6 afternoon with my 2 kids aged 2 & 5. Seeing the crowd at the Yayoi Kusama exhibition, I decided to explore elsewhere & headed to level 5; true enough, it was almost empty. My son was drawn to an exhibit with peculiar chopsticks & asked the Visitor Experience (VE) officer what it was. All he answered with a tensed expression was ""Please don't touch, move back"" despite being asking a few times. So my son went on to look at other things, before heading back to the other side of the same exhibit. The same VE officer, Sam, I noted, was wary & spread his arms to tell him off again. My 2yo was walking towards another exhibit & I managed to scoop her up. He then told me to ""control my kids"". I replied that he is not touching the exhibit & that he is merely curious. If kids are not welcomed at the gallery, please display a sign instead of treating them this way. I questioned if his attitude towards us was because we were locals?

This moment, another VE Officer dashed over, pointed to my 2yo and almost shouted, ""Please put it in the stroller and not let it move around and touch the exhibit!"" Well, excuse me. IT? Did he just refer to my 2yo baby, obviously a girl, as IT? I told him that kids will be kids, obviously he didn't raise one. He proudly claimed he did & his son is well-behaved & went on to criticise my parenting style. I noted he didn't wear a nametag & asked for his name & he said he didn't have to tell me. My kids were really scared by now & my son backed off to sit at the bay window, which has a parapet that you can obviously sit on. Sam went towards him to ask him not to sit there, I asked him why? I have seen so many people sit on such spaces & there is no sign. My son was scared by him and ran off. The older VE Officer, whom I later learned to be Lawrence, then menacingly shouted at me that ""If your son touch or damage anything, I will make him pay!"" before spreading his arms to go after my son. It was really dramatic. The security arrived & there were radio calls made.

After my son returned to my side, Sam told me that I have to stay and wait for the manager. Mind you, in a condescending tone, not in an apologetic attempt to try to salvage the situation. Lawrence even said that I was a disgrace & told his colleague proudly that he was going to the rescue of Sam. How heroic. I asked didn't his son move around? Was he handicapped? And he snapped & said that I insulted him - after all the rubbish he spouted about me! Well done, 2 grown men versus 1 woman with 2 young kids, what a shame on them! They behaved more like bouncers! Chatrine arrived & tried to understand the situation while escorting me down. She was very professional & reassuring but I broke down in the lift. It was too humiliating & traumatising for us. Zara later on met us to resolve the issue & was the epitome of professionalism as well.

When I recalled the incident to my husband in the evening, I was still very shaken & cried. My 2 kids woke up & cried in the middle of the night as well. So thank you National Gallery for this terribly upsetting experience. Please kindly:
1. Train your Visitor Experience Officers to speak properly & well. Obviously they don't have any exhibit knowledge nor manners to handle visitors & will only serve to marr experiences at the gallery. Their uncouth reaction was uncalled for & unfair to us. There are more professional ways to handle it. There wasn't even a crowd & they were so flustered! No matter how majestic the building or well-curated the art pieces, having such hooligans as your ambassadors is a shame on one of our Singapore icons. Please learn from National Museum; their security, staff & activities facilitators were all so well-organised & pleasant during our recent visit!
2. If children are not welcomed, please put a sign; families will thank you for it rather than to be treated like dirt! To think that you are holding the Children Biennale, it is truly contradictory.
3. Black tape looks swanky but is not a good enough deterrent; I have seen adults & tourists crossed the black tape to get closer to exhibits, yet they were not given the same golden treatment as us.

So parents beware, don't bring your young kids to National Gallery or you will get risked being treated likewise!",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 13:06:45.793065

Given that it's the School Holidays now, the crowd was very huge and we were glad to reach there early because the ticketing queue was very long.

Actually, if you just want the General admission tickets , you just need to go to the staff standing beside the ticketing counter to get a sticker after showing proof of citizenship (for singapore citizens). There is no need to join in the ticketing queue. It will save you a lot of time!

If there is one place to see in Singapore, this is it!. This is where Singapore's most important historic moments took place and, being in the heart of the city, the Gallery also offers from its rooftop an impressive view of the new Singapore (skyline is breathtaking).The art collections of SEA and Singapore artists and the Chinese Ink exhibition are beautiful, the buildings themselves (it is hosted in the previous City Hall and Supreme Court) are just beautifully preserved and renovated and the architecture addition (the linkage between the 2 buildings, the attention to detail) are just impressive. Most probably also the best view of Singapore from the rooftop gardens whether this is during the day or as the night sets in the city lits up. Everytime I spend time there with my friends or family, we always leave recharged and inspired and with something new to talk about. At the moment, the Gallery is also hosting a Children Biennale with amazing interactive displays for children (I had to drag my 5 ys old out of the place!!) but even when the Children Biennale is not on, the Gallery has this Keppel Center for Art Education open to children to draw, craft and just be kids! I also tried few of the many dinning options there: Owl Cafe for local food or try the National Kitchen for Peranakan delights. You can also just enjoy a nice drink and some finger food on the top terrace at Aura. But just go your own pace, roam around, explore, go to the art galleries, take a rest, take photos, get lost in the building and just take it all in..I bet you will want to go again and again and again....",05-2017,Family,2020-01-30 13:06:47.294827

We loved that they were able to create a whimsical, ""Alice-in-wonderland""-esque fantasy land where our toddler can immerse herself and imagine she was in the stories that she had read about. She can read on and slide down the tree, read on and hop on the logs over the ponds, discover what the bunnies or tigers are doing at different corners/themes of this forest room. Would hate to see this exhibit removed. Once this exhibition is over, it should definitely be re-purposed to be a great playground at a library or a pre-school!

Overall, I feel this exhibit is different from the interactive and/or digital exhibits that most other museums have nowadays... it encourages more... imaginative play... something kids these days don't have enough of.

Though we didn't get to check out the other works at the gallery, the gallery's shop was a delight to bring home some unique, artistic and meaningful memorabilia that we don't see selling anywhere else.",02-2017,Family,2020-01-30 13:06:54.877839

Webrought 2 prams with us , my son's and my friend's bub's.
Since the place was very huge, bringing the pram to respected levels was deemed necessary to us to minimise the trouble.(a whole day event to explore the gallery) However, we were asked to park the pram at level 1 (if I'm not wrong) and walked to the different parts of the gallery which was rather far from one to another with baby on hand and holding the kids' hands. When staff was approached to negotiate if we could bring the prams, the answer was a straight forward "" no

There was children museum that the kids were excited to visit within the gallery. Kids beng kids they just made a bit of noise in the museum ( it was kid's museum, and a story telling PLAYGROUND -with circular slide that supposed to serve the purpose as being a playground for the kids) however the staffs were so busy ""ssh"" ing around our kids trying to silent our kids. ..our kids behaved like when they were in Australian libraries(keep themselves as quite as possible) but they were a number of staff that followed our kids around to make sure that they were not making noises.
I felt so uncomfortable and did make a complain to the staff but they said ""we just do our job and follow the rule""

I hope the gallery would do something about this, as i believe there are many tourists come to Singapore whose kids are educated in western culture to express freely in their learning journey.

,1,24,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/abc_at_Huntsville,397977365,27-07-2016,3,"A disappointment: lacks variety, organization","The museum was free for us (one S'pore citizen and one int'l student), and that was the best part. If it was not free, it would perhaps have garnered a lower rating. While we happened to receive a discount, tourists or other visitors may have to pay a considerable fee to enter (I forgot how much exactly). No matter how much you pay, you will still need to get a ticket.

On the plus side, the museum was very quiet and peaceful, and the staff were quite polite and helpful. The building itself is also an attraction in its own right. But as the museum was called the ""National Gallery"", I was under the perception that it was the flagship art museum of Singapore. But I only learned after visiting that this museum was devoted to modern art. This is not clearly stated, and I had expected to see a variety of classical and modern art. This might have made me considerably more disappointed than I would have been otherwise, and my review may be a bit biased.

That being said, they advertise the museum as comparably sized to the Musée d'Orsay and other world-class art museums. You would think such a large museum would have a wide variety of items to see. But bigger doesn't mean better, and this place is an example.

The numerous galleries lack organization and it is very difficult to make a distinct ""path"" through the museum. It's almost as if they intentionally designed it like a maze. There are no signs to stay ""start here"" and the arrows to the next exhibit are not clear enough. A map was not given at the ticketing counter, and I only found one used map lying in an empty rack. And when you have permanent galleries dedicated to the work of just one artist (for example the Wu Guanzhong Gallery), and often a whole of row of paintings from just one artist, you can tell that they are struggling to fill up all the empty wall space.

The ""Reframing Modernism"" exhibit, although the highlight temporary exhibit, was very forgettable. Many of the artworks lacked descriptions, and for those who are not very well-versed in art (like me), the lack of an informative, easy-to-understand description/explanation of an artwork makes the huge number of pictures just seem overwhelming rather than interesting.

The building itself gets high marks for mix the of modern and classical design, and the wonderful view of the Singapore skyline from the roof. There are restaurants in the museum, but we did not go to any of them and decided to go out for lunch, then return. It was quite nice that we didn't even need a return stamp when we wanted to leave. It was all honor system (there are no fare gates), which is very unlike Singapore, I have to say.

I'm not an expert of art, so I won't say much about the quality of the art itself. I found some to be quite interesting. When we visited the museum, a Picasso, and a Matisse was on display in the ""Reframing Modernism"" exhibit. Though, in my opinion, this museum particularly excels in ""abstract expressionist"" art and modern sculpture, most of which are made by local artists from the region.

Overall, I wouldn't be opposed to visiting this museum again, with the knowledge that this museum is dedicated to modern art. The silence and emptiness of the galleries on a quiet weekday was refreshing in a place as hectic as Singapore, and the rooftop gives you a great view of the Singapore skyline. Some of the art is pretty good as well. But I found the arrangement of all the galleries to be very confusing, like a maze. And the museum seems far too big for the amount of variety of artwork in their collection. It was almost as if they forced the museum to be big in order to ""show-off"".",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 13:07:33.202745

My brother-in-law had stories to share with us to tell us what the different area were before the change and where he use to go for supreme court in the past.
Very nicely done..Our friends from the united states who have been in Singapore for 1 year were truly thankful for the 3D playground where their 2 year old twins truly enjoyed running around with my 6 year old and 10 year old niece who were so ready to look after the twins while their parents had time to catch up.
Excellent visit and definately need to return. The only sad part was the steep cost for foreigners like my husband of $20 entry, eventhough he is a resident married to a Singaporean. All residents in Singapore no matter what pass they are holding should be able to enjoy a discount for entry.
We will be back to checkout more of the National Gallery and especially Violet Oon's restaurant which was closed due to CNY today.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 13:08:01.451354

If I were to add up all the art & museum spaces around Singapore, we do have a size that could match the Louvre. As for the art, it is rightly asian centric. For European art, go to the Louvre. This place is where many pieces of important art and sculptures from asian artist are kept. The building that was renovated for this place is an art by itself. City Hall is a historical landmark. And if you venture up to the roof patio, many may not know it, the Singapore flag pole marks the survey datum point from which the whole of Singapore is measured against.

This is only free to citizens, there is a minimal charge for others. Check out the guided tours, the guides are knowledgeable and it would deepen your visit with their commentary.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-30 13:08:01.816438

It's very interesting to see how new additions have been included to complement the existing structures, and how the space within is converted into exhibition galleries, spacious lobbies and niche restaurants.

The only complain I have about the place is the incompetent staff at the ticketing counter: we brought our helper along with us, and the ticketing staff insisted that we pay $20 for her to enter, while the rest of us enter for free. She then went on to say, ""Maybe you want to reconsider visiting the galleries"". What was she trying to hint at? That I cannot afford $20? I was offended by that, but didn't pursue the matter, until she went on to serve another guest who wasn't at all in the queue. Still, I merely made sure she completed my transaction before serving someone else, and didn't give her what she deserved, as I have my children with me.

Perhaps better works were not showcased. So my advice is not to pay the hefty entrance fees until better art is displayed in the future. The Visitor Officers were just waiting for me to step across the line so that they can reprimand me in less than a second. I received a more hostile reception than my 6 year old son when he crossed the line to have a closer look at Mona Lisa in the Louvre. This also happened once when I was just reading a plastic plaque whose fonts were too small for my old eyes. Anyway this is the most excellent reflection of the Singapore culture.

When I visited in 2009 this wasn't opened but I'm so glad I was able to visit on this occasion. The historic building fused with modern fittings made for a welcome blend of old and new. We started in the Supreme Court wing and thrilled to see the preserved court rooms housing collections of South East Asian Art. I absolutely loved learning about the artists and influences of this region which, having mainly visited European galleries, was an utter revelation. We met Benjamin, a visitor ambassador who gave us an ad hoc lecture on various works in the gallery housing the enormous Saleh painting of the forest on fire.

This was an extremely welcome situation as I felt I came away with a greater understanding and appreciation for the art on display which I wouldn't have otherwise. We then had lunch in the National Kitchen which was delicious before going to the City Hall: If walls could talk exhibition in the same room that the Japanese surrendered to the Allies at the end of WWII.

This was then topped by a stunning view of the Singapore skyline at the rooftop bar.

It is quite easy to spend an entire day in this place quite by accident. This place has it all: art, history, a stunning view, interesting architecture and preserved courtrooms all in one location. Thoroughly recommend a visit.",10-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 13:08:36.388337

Even in the lower cost watercolour medium, first, I was able to emotionally associated with the familiar places the artist painted; places iconic to me as I have grown up in my home Singapore! Second, I appreciated the artist's abilities to extract different details for focus in each painting. He painted the same scene varying its time period or weather or colour or light-shadow or vertical-horizontal orientation. For instance, in his painting of Fullerton Building, he depicted a hot and busy morning crowded w officer workers seeking breakfast before work, with bright red, orange and yellow colours. In a contrasting painting of the same scene, the tree faded into the painting as he wanted us to focus on the groomy sky depicting rain was imminent.

Like exploring Southeast Asian culture?!,"If the answer to any of the above is, ""Yes"", then you should definitely consider visiting the National Gallery of Singapore. It's easy to get to. Several MRT stations are nearby but City Hall is closest - and that is probably because half of the Gallery is housed within the old City Hall. The other half of the Gallery is in the adjacent Supreme Court Building. From the outside both buildings demonstrate their colonial majesty admirably (and are designated national monuments) but were converted into a terrific, flexible art and culture space in 2015. The interiors itself is worth the admission fee alone!

But, of course, art is the real draw. The Gallery hosts the world's largest public collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asian art. Spanning many different eras, styles, media and ethnic origin, the collection is rich and, to be honest, my wife and I failed to get round everything in our first trip. We will be back though!

If you are in Singapore for only a short time and only have a couple of hours to visit I would recommend one of the free guided tours. These are mostly delivered by highly knowledgeable docents and appear to run on the hour (late morning into the afternoon), covering different exhibits. We attended one tour and it was a great way to dive into some the Gallery's highlight works.

The new ultramodern basement level adjoining the two buildings with link bridges was somewhat incongruent architecturally, but functional nevertheless.

We were privileged to have met Benjamin Ramalingam, who was a guide in one of the halls of the Old Supreme Court Building. He was a fount of knowledge about the history of Singapore, its constitution and its legal system. He exuded with enthusiasm and highlighted the legacy left by British to Singapore and the roles played by the founding fathers William Farquhar and Stamford Raffles.

And in two hours, you barely skim the surface. This is the type of attraction that could be an all day affair. The pricing was fairly complicated the day we went (there were two special shows), plus there are various discounts that might apply. We opted for the two special exhibitions only ... which was a wise decision, because there really was no time for anything else. The French Impressionist exhibition was absolutely perfect. The write-ups on the walls condensed a great deal of knowledge and observations into a readable and compelling paragraph or two for each room. I learned more about Impressionism from this curator's thoughts than I did from the entire rest of my life. The show traces the pre-Impressionist style through the various artistic styles over the years. Plus, the paintings they had on display were diverse, numerous and so powerful to look at. The guards are a bit overly predatory as far as catching free-loaders, I thought. So, have your sticker out and displayed prominently.

The area is VAST and the ingenuity and style and taste are impressive. There is a stunning yellow-ish metallic cover that stretches over what was the 'gap' and tumbles down to fall a canopy at the entrances on either side. There is a roof garden gallery with a huge pool and a transparent base, so from the floor below you can see up through it. There are smart walkways connecting the two wings. Elsewhere, though, they have simply let alone some beautiful original architectural details - pristine, honeycomb wooden ceilings, a rotunda like a mini British Library Reading Room - and you can look down on its white domed roof. Etc etc.

I THINK we did a pretty good job in terms of viewing. We covered quite a lot of Far Eastern contemporary art, but spent substantial time over two excellently curated special exhibitions: 'Century of Light' - a tribute to Impressionists both major and minor with a heap of works borrowed from the Musée d'Orsay and deftly arranged by theme; and 'Between Worlds' - a joint retrospective of 2 formidable, yet lesser known artists - Raden Saleh and Juan Luna (from Indonesia and the Philippines respectively) - again curated with panache - Saleh presented on lapis walls with gold lined archways between the various chambers and Luna on scrumptuous pink walls also with the gold embellishments. Stunning!

What else? Incredibly helpful and polite staff/custodians - impeccably clad in neat grey and black uniforms.

We took the one hour guided tour with Jenny, our very knowledgeable guide, who took us through the old Courthouse and then the Municipal building which have been woven so cleverly and beautifully into one National Art Gallery. The central atrium, joining the two, with its amazing glass draped ceiling is a free open space, worth seeing on its own. But pay the entrance fee and learn from the tour some of the history of the founding of Singapore, how the court sessions were conducted, see the holding jails, and then some of the important events in the political development of the country...all fascinating.
In fact we spent so long on looking at the actual buildings and history that we had little energy left for visiting many of the actual art exhibits! I personally thought the new Impressionists exhibition, our original reason for the visit, a little disappointing. But we will certainly be coming back to see some of the SE Asia art, glimpses of which were amazing.

Even if you do not go for the special exhibition, there are still many things you can see for free or with general admission. National Gallery Singapore mainly focuses on Southeast Asian art. National Gallery Singapore is also currently having a 4-months-long Gallery Children's Biennale, which consists of interactive installations all around the museum. There are usually queues and time restrictions (3 minutes per group) for Yayoi Kusama’s Obliteration Room as well as teamLab’s Homogenising and Transforming World.

Apart from appreciating art, you can enjoy beautiful architecture and history here. This was actually my favourite aspect of the museum. National Gallery Singapore is housed within the former Supreme Court and old City Hall buildings. The noteworthy features include Holding Cells, Chief Justice Court Room, Rotunda Library, Rotunda Library Dome, Former Supreme Court Library, Former Supreme Court Main Foyer, Main Dome, Tree Columns, City Hall Chambers, and Old City Hall Lobby and Steps.

With general admission, I spent 3 hours at National Gallery Singapore. I highly recommend visiting National Gallery Singapore for the art and architecture. You can even go on a museum tour, as there are many other prominent museums in the City Hall or Raffles Place area, including National Museum of Singapore, Peranakan Museum, Singapore Philatelic Museum, and Asian Civilisations Museum.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 13:11:02.775949

You could wander around without a clear sense of purpose for quite a while so a guided tour is probably a good idea.

But the Empire exhibition alone was not the reason for the 5 star review. Other galleries displayed a range of Asian art that was breathtaking, inspired and, in some instance, hilarious.

Tickets are quite expensive - and the gallery follows the nasty practice of charging more for anybody who doesn't live in Singapore. The selection of art is sometimes interesting: the way the colonists viewed the alien peoples they found themselves ruling over is a good subject. But it misinterprets: Australian landscape artists, for example, are depicted as an instance of growing awareness of independent nationality. At the end of the 19th century, Australians would have thought of themselves as south British; national consciousness came much later. And the pictures of native peoples at the height of Empire are an incomplete depiction of how the colonists viewed the ""subject peoples"". For instance, the notorious Hottentot Venus is missing - and there is no mention of how aboriginal people's remains were taken to the mother country as curiosities. Sometimes the colonists showed a fair contempt for the natives. The West Indian colonies and Africa get little coverage and there is nothing about the opium trade and the Chinese expeditions of the 19th century. Worst of all, some of the exhibits are quite small and are behind glass; you cannot see them properly because the gallery people have painted lines on the floor a fair way from the art works - and you are forbidden to cross the line. In true Singapore control freak mode, when you go into a section of the gallery an attendant will emerge and silently shadow you. There may be some point in keeping people away from an unprotected large oil painting, but doing this to a 30cm by 30cm print in a glass frame simply means that nobody can see the thing properly. This was an inadequate exhibition spoiled by the way the items were over-protected, and I didn't think it was worth the excessive entrance fee.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 13:11:21.719667

First the basics:

Yes, they have covered parking which most of the museums in Singapore do not offer.

Yes, they have discounts available if you're a Singtel Subscriber. Just show them your phone and the Singtel logo to get a discount for the entrance fees.

Note, that if you want to see everything you will need to pay extra for the various exhibitions that rotate through the National Gallery from quarter to quarter.

There are restaurants in the Gallery, many of them, are of the sit down, fine dining variety which are only open a few hours at lunch, and again at dinner, so if you're there mid to late afternoon you may go hungry. To check their hours and down load a map to your phone, go to Nationalgallery.sg web site.

We arrived around 1:30 and meandered through some of the Singapore historical galleries. These galleries contain a wonderfully diverse collection of paintings, etchings, drawings, photographs, sculptures and artifacts from colonial days up through the 60's.

As we were unaware of the limited dining hours, we managed to get a table at Violet Oons for a late lunch (see separate review).

After lunch, we continued to the paid exhibition, entitled ""Arist and Empire, (En)Countering Colonial Legacies."" This exhibition included a varied collection of works reflecting numerous artists interpretations, from both sides (colonists and colonized) of life during colonial times throughout Asia and India. It was well worth the money paid.

We also spent some time just checking out the place, admiring the modern additions and updates to these beautiful, old buildings. I especially liked the roof top water garden which creates dancing shadows throughout the interior spaces and beautiful reflecting ponds on the top floor. The top floor offers great views and photo ops of the Padang, where the 7's rugby matches are held, the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, and of course, the ever changing Singapore skyline. There is also a restaurant and bar on the top floor, but the weather was too hot to make it a viable option at the end of our day touring the many Galleries below.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 13:11:36.718230

Excellent restoration of the building.

The building itself is quite interesting and imposingly large. We enjoyed visiting some of the galleries in the section which is the former supreme court building and seeing the old courtrooms - most of which are now dedicated to art displays.

While it was an encouraging sign to see them learning and appreciating arts at an early age, the whole process was conducted in a rather disturbing manner. The children were seated on the floor while the adults were literally ""shouting"" in the teaching process, and their voices echoed around the gallery so much that even if you are in another part of the building you can hear the teacher talking!

In many other leading museum or galleries around the world, tour groups are required to use wireless transmitters/receivers so that the tour leader speaking into the microphone can be heard by each members of the group without having to raise their voice. In the absence of such tour guide systems, groups should be told to keep their voices down by whispering and not shouting in an otherwise quiet emvironment, and the gallery hosts should intervene if the group becomes too noisy.

Also it was disheartening to see that school teachers are not trained or aware that teaching in a public space like an art gallery is not the same as in classroom. They have to teach by example as otherwise kids growing up would think talking loudly in a museum or gallery is acceptable. Sadly such behaviour in fact reflected negatively on the society and the education system as a whole.

I would not put that Museum as a priority if you have a short time to visit Singapore. I think lowering the ticket price or letting the visitor pay as he wishes (e.g. Metropolitan Museum) would help generate more traffic as it was fairly low when I was there. We were only 4 persons attending the free guided tour in the morning and I knew why after the tour. I was a bit surprised the museum was not as interactive as what Singapore used to show in other museums in town. Great piece of architecture otherwise.

Pros:
- Museum is free for local people. I have noticed the same in countries like Mexico and I believe it's a great initiative (I am not local).
- The architecture of that building is great, from the classic parts of both buildings used by the museum to the most modern additions. It became quickly my main point of interest during the visi. Singapore needs to take Chicago as an example to propose more offers around architecture tourism.
- The museum has a pretty good and diverse collection of South East Asian art that should enable any visitor to find something they like.
- Great views on Singapore from the roof terrace (does not require a ticket if you try to access restaurants).

Cons:
- I usually use Louvre museum as my price reference (15 euros ticket). At 20 SGD, that museum seems overpriced to me and the absence of queuing during the week is a sign I might be right.
- The guided tour was the poorest I ever got. One more ""this is the Singapore river"" or ""this is Chinatown"" and I would have lost it. I really expect from the guide to have context about the artist and about the art piece. None of that was delivered.... very disappointing.",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 13:12:05.567527

Good attempt at exhibits but needs improving!,"Having been living away from Singapore for a while, my husband who had visited National Gallery ahead of me was very keen to bring me here. I wasn't too enthusiastic especially having been to many amazing museums in my life. And I had little expectations.

The journey to National Gallery started from the walk from City Hall MRT to National Gallery. It was the Art Connector. The design of the art connector was a little tacky but the sheltered walk was much appreciated. Be it sheltering you from the sun or rain, it is an awesome sheltered walk. A little hint of what is to come.

The entrance of the museum looked humble externally but once you stepped in, aahhh....the international feel of a world-class museum. There are docents everywhere trying to help you. We were enthusiastically introduced to the National Gallery App. I asked if there is WIFI and was proudly informed there is free WIFI. I downloaded the jazzy app powered by Accenture. Then the embarrassing moment : the connection went off, and the docent sheepishly admitted that the WIFI had not been stable & the museum is still rectifying it. LoL, sounded like the MRT too.

The combination of the Supreme Court and City Hall into one building is absolutely brilliant and absolutely well-executed. The experience French architect who designed it, is evident. The docent who conducted the building tour helped us to appreciate the efforts that went in to preserve these two historical buildings at a whopping cost of $530million. Having just returned from Europe, I know it takes lots of planning & tenacity to undertake such a major project. The juxtaposition of modern architecture and historical architecture is brilliant. Go to the roof top and you get a most awesome area view of the Padang and esplanade.

I begin to understand my hubby's enthusiasm for bringing me here. He has been dragged to all the modern museums, from NYC, California, Paris, Kanazawa, and Bilboa. He wanted me to witness a masterpiece sitting at my home country.

We now move from the hardware to the software. It is obvious that this museum is trying her very best. There are docents all over, trying to help. There are free tours by the hour. Even the admission is free for Singaporeans. As we walked through the exhibits, my heart could not help but feel that Singapore is finally maturing in the arts scene. The museum has cleverly crafted her niche in South-east Asian Modern Art, instead of trying to compete with her rivals on the world stage.

My heart warms to see Asian artists being featured : Iskandar Jalil, Chua EK Kay, and Wu Guanzhong. UOB deserves special mention, as a non-govt sponsored entity for sponsoring a series of art competitions to encourage struggling but talented artists to blossom in a country that has placed economic progress ahead of arts. There are children's activities to engaged children in arts. I like to see the works of SOTA and La Salle being featured & engaged. I like to see the products from Pathlight or Christian Outreach for the handicapped being featured and sold here.

The museum seemed to struggle in filling up the ample spaces. Understandably, Southeast Asian Modern Art is a niche. There should be more invites made to talented Asian artists in region to enhance the arts scene. The thought ""white elephant"" did fleetingly come to my mind.

Finally, even though I benefitted from the free entry, it bothers me greatly to preview some of the comments on TA. It seems to me that many are visiting the National Gallery because it is free. Tourists included. Being free cheapens the entire restoration project & the will to drive and make the National Gallery world-class. I would have much prefer that an entry fee is charged and the amount is redeemable at F&B outlets or the museum stores. Talk a walk to any starbucks coffee. If students can pay $7 for a cup of coffee on a regular basis, surely they can afford paying some entrance fees to a world-class National Gallery?",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 13:12:07.081757

When we went at the beginning of March 2016, several exhibits were still not operational but this is just a small section. The vast majority of the gallery was already on the display. The remaining was slated to open in April.

The gallery is housed in two monuments, the old City Hall and former Supreme Court. The architects have tastefully combined these two monuments, enclosing the space between and building a few bridges between in modern minimalist design. I thought it was an excellent marriage of neo-classical and contemporary style. The designers have also done a commendable job of preserving the old court rooms within the Supreme Court and using them as the exhibit rooms.

The Supreme Court section houses an extensive collection of South East Asian art spanning 150 years. I have not seen a collection elsewhere as good.

This one has top marks for the works it contains. We're very familiar with the impact of Asian and S E Asian art on Europeans like Gaugin, Rousseau, Picasso, the Ballet Russes etc but not with influences moving in the other direction: the development of SE Asian artists as they got to grips with European imagery. These works were all new to me and I enjoyed coming to grips with them. When will there be an exhibition of this work in a major European art gallery?

However while the collection is world class there needs to be some work still on how the collection is exhibited before the whole thing is world class.
The renovated buildings that house the collection are wonderful in themselves but a bit of a nightmare to navigate. We were very grateful for the advice given by a woman at the visitors desk about how to plan our route round the buildings. There is no comprehensive guide book. There is a floor plan which you get with your ticket but on its own it's hard to make sense of.
There was an audio,guide but you can only hire it if you have a photo ID. unfortunately we always lock our passports ( our only photo ID) in our hotel safe when we travel so we didn't have enough ID. In other places we have been able to leave a credit card or cash deposit. But not here. There will be an android app but that wasn't ready when we visited.

There are very friendly staff in each gallery who approach and welcome you when you enter. But most of them seem to know little about the art works in the rooms, and could not answer, or in some cases understand the questions we asked. It is true that I would not expect 'security' staff in galleries to be expert in the works they looked after, but they would never normally approach me apparently to tell me about the works: and the staff at the National Gallery did approach me, so I presumed they knew the works and wanted to talk to me about them.

The final disappointment was being sent to the roof terrace cafe ( 'smoke and mirrors') to relax and have coffee, to be told when we arrived that the coffee machine wasn't working and we couldn't have coffee.
Second time in 3 days I've been told this on this holiday. What's the problem with local coffee machines?
I can't imagine the National Gallery in London not being able to serve coffee ( and consequently cake and what goes with coffee) in its main cafe. Cafes in galleries in the world are significant income generators, this needs fixing.

There’s a guided tour daily, at 11am which concentrates on the history of the building. Places are limited to 20, and photo ID is required (I think this is to ensure visitors do not walk off with the headsets). The tour should last an hour, but it actually took 90 minutes. The volunteer guide had worked in the court as an usher which made the tour personal. Also another of our group had regularly visited the courtroom in his lunch hour to listen to the proceedings.
Judging by our group, about 50% were local, so this tour appeals to everybody.
We also loved the views of the city from Level 6.
Excellent toilets are available in several places on every floor. Disabled access is great, with lifts and ramps as necessary. There were plenty of places to sit, except when waiting for the guided tour to start, where seating was inadequate (5 seats for 20 people).
Our only disappointment was lunch, bought from Gallery & Co on Level 1. The sandwiches were tasty, but I really expect a café in that price range to serve them on a plate, perhaps with a side salad and not just wrapped in paper. We had to get the staff to cut them in half to make it practical to eat them. And it was the first place in Singapore which hasn’t offered ice with soft drinks. Better food options are available outside the museum.
We didn’t have time in the end to see the art galleries, that will have to wait for another visit. But we really enjoyed learning about the history of the buildings, and the way the courts worked in Singapore both under British rule, and after independence.

Indeed, it is a western obsession, death-by-Museum-boring, but in Singapore it gathers new depths by punishing the tourists by overcharging the entry fee; and obviously letting the beleaguered local school kids in free, thus rubbing the gwai-lo's nose in it.
Thanks guys.I feel special.
Furthermore, the exhibits are somewhat inaccurately described (especially in the war related section) and under represented.for what was one of the epicenters (and most fascinating) geographical locations of the second war. It has been toned down, no doubt to soften the offence for the Japanese tourists, which is a shame. I use the word carefully.
The only decent part was the visiting exhibition from the British Museum. The rest of the place is deathly boring. Architecturally, it is cool-ish, and it could be dressed up a treat as the bones of the place are wondrous. The retail section is overpriced and has rather a dull selection and staff who glare. Technology is low-tech, and the overall curation within the Museum is either absent or performed by someone who is neither brave nor bold.
This could be so much more-so much. Random musical performances. Acrobats. Food break-out areas. Good coffee. Tea Tarik. Buns. Soldiers in period uniforms. Tech, tech, and more tech. WIFI. Monetise it! Sell me!
This could be the most exciting place to visit in Singapore, but it is mostly boring, and the staff seem to be strangely terrified...what's that about?

For clarity, I only made one mistake out of the numerous instances I’m about to list, and it was the worst offence out of them all...of course.

There are many doors to enter the different galleries, which are all open to use, however if you enter one which isn’t the official entrance then a member of staff will scurry over to you and force you to enter a different door. Lock the doors, put signs up OR just let people enter and wander round freely.

When you enter the gallery, they force you to view the art pieces in a particular order. First time this has ever happened to me.

They have tape markings on the floor to keep the viewer a distance away from the piece. A lady put her big toe in the zone and they were straight over to reprimand her.

You can’t drink in the galleries (that’s mine ✋) and the only justified one ‍♂️

The staff also follow you round the gallery which is unsettling and they don’t do a good job of covering it up. Definitely not secret agent material.

There’s an unnecessary limitation on your freedom in there, the environment goes against what the art represents.

The number of works by Monet was impressive and there were also works by Manet, Renoir, Seurat, Corot, Gauguin, Berthe Morrisot and so on. And these were not all minor works but well known with a Monet of Rouen Cathedral and several of the water lilies at Giverny.
Just before the exit there was also some old film footage showing Renoir, his hands severely crippled with arthritis still painting in old age, and Monet in his garden at Giverny, painting one of his water lilies works.

It really wasn't what I expected - it's mostly a modern art museum (everything is from the last 200 years, and about 2/3rds is from the last 100). This means that it's fairly easy to relate to for people whose art history education is purely western (eastern and western art starts to converge around 1920 and converges almost completely by 1970).
I love that this place is game to show contemporary art that would be regarded as too controversial in many parts of Asia (albeit with an amusing 'covers racial/religious themes and may offend' warning placard) - its collection of Asian contemporary art is by far the best I've ever seen.
There are lots of free (after you pay the entry free) tours (more than are advertised on the website), I did the South East Asia highlights tour and really enjoyed it, it added so much to my understanding - ask for directions to the sign-up desk when you buy your ticket.
Tickets for foreigners are rather pricy, but cheaper if you show your Singapore Airlines boarding pass. But if you only want to see the architecture, you can walk around all areas except the galleries without a ticket.",10-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 13:14:22.764611

The Infinity Mirrored Room - Gleaming Lights of Soul was truly remarkable. Since this attraction was very popular there were long queues and everyone is allowed in groups of 3s for 30s to allow everyone to have an opportunity to visit. Some galleries feature a number of intricate designs and artwork that you can enjoy. The dot room is also limited to a number of people each time and you can take as many photos as your heart desires. You can also view the pumpkin through a small window and see the remarkable creations Yayoi Kasuma has created. This exhibit runs until September 3rd so don't miss out!

I also visited the Children's Biennale which also features some amazing exhibits. It features the work of nine artists. Yayoi Kasuma has an amazing room which started out as white but as everyone adds stickers the room has taken a magical turn. Another room worth visiting is the Homogenizing and Transforming World by Teamlab which features a number of balls that change color as you touch them.

Other than the special exhibits take a walk around and explore the portraits and the magnificent building. If you are visiting Singapore, you should definitely add the National Gallery to your list.

What makes this one unique is the fact that it is a remake of two historical buildings recently renovated and turned into a single massive museum.

The structure used to house Singapore's Municipal Hall (opened in 1929 and later renamed the City Hall Building) and Supreme Court (inaugurated in 1939). As such, it had witnessed many significant events in the history of Singapore (like being sworn into office of its heads of state and members of the City Hall Chamber, the surrender of the Japanese at the end of WWII, and so forth).

The new Gallery was opened to the public only last November 2015. The architecture itself is worth a visit! There are areas of the museum open to the public for free (like levels 4 and 5, where you can have access to the former Supreme Court terrace and the Roof Garden with its posh restaurants), while a general admission is needed to visit some of its art galleries.

Aside from permanent exhibits, the gallery also holds temporary ones. I was very lucky to have visited the exhibit of the renowned Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama during my visit there last July 2017. If you're not into modern and contemporary arts, you may still enjoy the display of some old documents associated with Singapore's history as well as marvel at the technicalities involved in the architecture of the building itself, or simply relax in one of its cafes, bars and restaurants on the rooftop while relishing a wonderful view of the city (particularly of the Marina Bay area).

The general admission to the gallery (for non-Singaporeans) is only SG$20. Additional charges must be paid for temporary or special exhibits. To get there, you can take bus numbers 195 and 961, or take the MRT and get off at the City Hall station (which is a five-minute walk from the entrance to the gallery).

the ticket price for this special exhibition includes loan of a samsung tab for audio guide, which in fact offers just 8 sound clips, together for 15 mins. Not really something helpful to be honest.

special thanks to one of the ticketing office staff, Iris. She was always sincere and kind. She talked to me on the exhibition while the credit card payment was processing. For the last visit I made few months back, she encouraged me to join the tour guide too.

Lastly as a reminder, the special exhibition costs $25 for non-SG, while $30 for combo with gallery general admission. So if one gonna stay in SG for sometime, can consider getting the annual pass for $75.

This time SAM was closed for changing exhibitions, so I was pleased that the National Gallery had opened since my last visit. I liked that they were open until 10pm on Saturday, and the staff were very helpful, e.g. suggesting a route and noting that I could get a $5 discount for being a foreign teacher (I hadn't even noticed the sign). It was very quiet though and in some galleries I felt awkward that staff outnumbered me four to one!

I had high expectations, and the buildings themselves didn't disappoint. The map was confusing at first, but I followed the numbered galleries of the southeast Asian art section, then the Singapore galleries, then the smaller ones in the City Hall building. I liked that you could get onto the roof and that they had preserved some of the rooms and included information about their original purpose.

So why only three stars? I have been to many, many art galleries in my travels - big, small, artists I knew well, artists I knew nothing about. This collection was comparatively boring for me. For the southeast Asian collection they do tell a story of how historical events affected art, but it wasn't really detailed enough to explain art from so many different countries. Some paintings had extra information next to them, but many didn't, and the art itself wasn't that attractive to me. I would have preferred having some kind of route to follow that told a story or showed a specific development in some way.

It's possible I'm being too harsh - after all, everyone has different tastes in art. I liked the Wu Guanzhong gallery that I visited at the end, for example, while others may not like that style of Chinese art. However, I couldn't help but feel rather 'meh' as I left.

The architects even saved the two jail cells where they used to keep people during trials.

* The building itself is amazing. The old Supreme Court and City Halls have been flawlessly merged into an attractive, modern building.
* Nice paintings from the early colonial period in the Singapore Galleries
* Nice paintings from the history of the British Empire in the first section of the current special exhibition ""Artist and Empire"" including portraits of the Queen, Lawrence of Arabia, Sir Stamford Raffles and local people; battle scenes and landscapes
*Very good display of historic constitutional documents
* Open till late on Friday and Saturday, giving you more flexibility to put it in your itinerary

Misses:
*the entry fee is expensive even with the discount from presenting a Singapore Airlines boarding pass
*In the permanent Singapore galleries and the special Empire exhibition the nice older paintings quickly peter out to rather ugly modern works.
*The staff were annoying. I had turned off my flash as required but was followed (at a distance) by one difficult staff member after a tiny red light went off on my camera while taking photos. I know she was following me as there were no other visitors at that late time in that particular section (approx. 8pm).
*Copyright: I was stopped from taking a photo of a very famous painting of the British surrender to the Japanese in 1942 on this flimsy pretext. As I told the staff, I have seen that painting reproduced thousands of times so it was a bit late for the copyright holder to get touchy about copies.
*The gift shop had a non-existent selection of postcards and gifts actually relevant to the collections. There were oodles of trendy items that could be bought anywhere else.",03-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 13:14:57.905200

Many older works were juxtaposed with recent works challenging the colonial attitudes embedded in the older works.

Old court rooms and holding cells as well as the modern architecture drawing two colonial buildings together. Tip from a local is to go back there after 4pm as there is a bar on the roof top where you get a panoramic view of Singapore (I'm trying that next time).

Second, the staff were all very helpful. (Ok, one was being overly solicitous but how can you take that against her when you know that she just wanted to be as helpful as possible?)

Third the exhibition itself (Artist And Empire: Encountering Colonial Legacies) was so well curated, properly spaced out and very informative (as long as you take the audio guide tour which is a downloadable app). I'll be honest though: I took in this exhibit twice. The first time was with a tour guide who was not as well-informed as I would like him to be although he was pleasant enough and could get passionate about the bits he knew about. The second time I took in the exhibit, I relied on the audio guide and that was when I enjoyed it so much more.

The exhibit will make you aware of how the colonisers control the narrative of their empire and how they manipulate their public image by way of art - and it shows how those who were colonised eventually reacted to this artistic imperialism also through art.",01-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 13:15:07.518909

I bought my ticket directly at the counter which is located at the basement. The man asked me a lot of questions verifying where I came from or if I were a student or member of the academe. It was because he wanted to make sure I avail of their free pass if I were a Singaporean, holding permanent residency status, student, or teacher. Unfortunately, I didn't hold any of these. He was very kind and explained to me the perks. So I got my ticket and started from basement, up.

I was in awe when I saw collections of arts from the Philippines. Paintings by our national artists Juan Luna, Felix Resurrecion Hidaldo, Arturo Luz, Jose Joya, Fernando Amorsolo, and Hernando Ocampo.

It is the most substantial of all the galleries and museums on the island, and while it is modest compared to the true giants like the Dutch Rijksmuseum, it definitely offers all the art you could hope to look at.

It is also a welcome breath of fresh air with its wide selection of Southeast Asian art. Don't get me wrong, I like the European old masters as much as anyone, but the selection here offers genuine new vistas for the western traveler, and such is always welcome.

There is a selection of different galleries within the building with different exhibitions, so you get to enjoy a broad selection of different styles, approaches, methods and materials. You definitely won't get bored with this kind of variety.

As is often the case in Singapore, the building itself is quite interesting as well, especially in the way that it is in fact two buildings connected into one.

The only possible downside is that the west wing is composed of smaller rooms, and is not very intuitive to navigate.

Being a gallery housed in an historic building it is easy to get distracted when visiting, as the layout and exhibits flow of the gallery are designed to suit the building which is less than ideal. Hence it is natural for many visitors to pause and take photograph of the interior space and architecture while passing through the court rooms and offices.instead of admiring at the art exhibits!

The Gallery surprised me! The building itself was an old supreme court/city hall and had the grandness of the old colonial building. It is always nice to see these kind of buildings in Asia. It makes me reflect on the history. There are two gallery cafes as well, which I didn't eat in. One sells cakes and drinks, the other sells 'proper food' like pastas and salads. It looks nice to sit at. There are big windows everywhere, which lets the light in and gives the building a bright and positive feel.
The exhibitions were also good. There were three. The Wu Guanzhong exhibition showed the works of the Chinese ink master, from his acrylic and oil painting stage to his more modern paintings of ink. It is curated so that you can see his development.
The Reframing Modernism exhibition compares 'western', more well known artist (such as Picasso, Kandinsky, Chagall...) with Asian artist of same style or era. It gives a boost to telling that Asian artists can have international standard works as well. It is also a great a way to see more artists of different origins in Asia. I liked it a lot.
I am most disappoint and disinterest by the Singapore art galleries. Singaporean art does not have a 'main theme' or style. I think it is because of the multi-racial heritage that the country has, therefore when you walk through the galleries, it feels like it is 'jumping' from styles to styles. I did not go through all the galleries of the Singaporean art.
The only thing that interest me about the art, was the Social Table placed outside the Singapore art gallery. It is basically a touch screen table, where you can look at the digital version of all the Singaporean art. You can click on an art piece and see its details or how the artist relates to other artists. Then you can 'save' it, and once you think you have saved all the ones you like, you send it to yourself or a friend. I think this is such a great idea for interaction and even as a 'souvenir'!
It is free to walk around the building. I would recommend people to at least come and see the building itself or have a cup of tea. If you are an art lover, then you could see what's on and decide whether you want to pay to see the exhibits.",05-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 13:15:44.835881

Both locals and tourists will find something to take away from the gallery at the end of the day. The collections are curated for easy perusal and deep thought all in one go.

The best is weak --with one notable exception that is an entire permanent gallery devoted to the work of the world famous Chinese artist Wu Guanzhong..& one suspects, given the Sing Govt's belated shift into the business of promoting art to it's people--the artist might not infact even be much represented there, given that most of the works on show he has in fact gifted to the Singaporean Govt.. Having said that it IS informative & delightful..I enjoyed it..but there's little else of artistic substance worth pursuing.

The galleries are topped with a super bar ( + there are expensive restaurants within various locations throughout) that has an amazing wide-screen , totally unencumbered view towards Marina Bay Sands.

I set aside about 4 hours to look at the art as well as the architecture, as well as having a coffee at the end, and I was left impressed and wanting for more.

I would recommend you to visit this place at 10am when it opens so that you can view the art in relative peace and quiet. Start from the ""City Hall"" side where you can view the historic Singapore art and work your way up from the 1st floor. Cross the bridge at the top floor, and make your way down the ""Supreme Court"" side, viewing the rotunda as you go. The ""Supreme Court"" part has more gallery exhibitions which are mostly from South-east Asia. There are a few pieces there which are truly stunning.

The National Gallery also has an app which you can download prior to going so you can plan your visit. I think it's fun but it's not necessary. Sometimes the best thing about viewing art is coming round the corner and seeing a beautiful piece which captures your eye.

There is a expansive children's section on the Ground floor which is very impressive. Plenty of top-notch cafes and restaurants let you have breaks throughout your visit.

The structure connecting both buildings is a nod to the traditional and modern with a modern looking tree as a support structure rather than just a pillar.

It merged the historic City Hall with the old Supreme Court buildings into one Gallery. There is so much art to see, it was kind of overwhelming. I could not find a great directory of the art itself. The staff was not overly responsive when asked questions. I read though that there are free tours, but I did not check them out.

I really liked the building though, a hugely expensive project done right, by merging these two older buildings. There is a cool picturesque courtyard and water feature on the open roof on the 5th floor and there are two cool rooftop bars looking East over and towards the view of the Marina Bay Sands area and Bay. One bar, Smoke and Mirrors is very popular right now.

You can go see the court holding cells and also how the architects masterfully joined the two buildings. One of the galleries now (Gallery One) was an old courtroom.

Worth a quick visit if you are a tourist, longer if you are an art fan. Also, great views and vibes from the rooftop bar and restaurant.

There is a famous restaurant there called National Kitchen by a very well known chef, that I did not get to check out. It is part of the National Gallery property though.

The complex is huge, and features some excellent architecture and well-designed galleries. The content of the galleries themselves was pretty good, though very ""safe"". A broader range of works, especially in the non-Singapore South-East Asian section would improve things, but I imagine will take time to develop. The special exhibition on the British Empire was worthwhile, but would have also benefited from a broader range of works. The museum shop was great. The attendants were also very helpful, and approached visitors to explain works.

A couple of areas for improvement are to revise the pricing ($30 for admission, and especially charging extra to see the permanent collection to people who've paid for the special exhibition, is too high for what's on offer) and to make better use of the building's huge numbers of corridors which are largely pretty barren.

The countless artworks are all unique and some of them are very interesting.You can learn a lot about the history of Southeast Asian countries in some galleries,while in others,you may find some obscure modern artworks.There are also areas for you to stamp seals on paper and take it home as souvenirs.There are specially designed children’s area so the young can also have fun.

It is a big blunder that my two other friends and I spent all our time in the Supreme Court wing,which made us miss all the interesting things in the City Hall wing.So if you are visiting the gallery and have limited time,please make sure you plan your time well and try to cover different areas,especially if it is your first visit.This will help you have a whole picture of the gallery.Another tip is that since it might take hours to visit it and the air conditioning is pretty powerful,it might be a good idea to to wear long trousers and bring a jacket.",11-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 13:17:31.997468

Children can create their own paintings on the second floor where provided painting rooms for children.
Before you leave the gallery, you can paint a postcard by yourself at the entrance of the gallery with pigments offered.

There are 5 floors in the gallery. Although all of them were great, but I'm still strongly recommend the third floor. Artworks there are mainly about South-east Asian history. Through these oil paintings ,it is as if you are taking a time machine and seeing the stories happen in the past.

The National gallery is really worth a visit. You not only can learn about Asian painting styles,but also learn about the local history.

The Gallery is so big that I spent 3 hours visiting entire the space. I was impressed by the variety of artworks and the architecture. You will feel comfortable here because there are many air conditioners and benches in case you are tired. One of the most impressive points here is the behaviors and attitudes of guides and managers, they are very friendly and willing to help me when I need.

Do read about the rules, prohibited things before you enter the National Gallery and make sure you deposit your bag at the reception because it takes much time to discover the Gallery. Moreover, if you want to know more about the artworks there, you also can book a tour guide at the reception .

(2) Through the artworks acquire an understanding of life in South East Asia. Two paintings in the gallery are featured on the back of the Singapore $50 note. Ask the staff which.

If you want to see wonderful art in the galleries, then pay ( i think about $25) to pop in to see some of the art on offer!

I was extremely pleased to discover this museum who has a very very progressive feel and inspiring atmosphere. It was my first time in Asia, so I can't compare it to other Asian museums, but I am an avid museum visitor in Europe and I find it a worthy competitor. I liked the exhibition currently on show, Artist and Empire, a large and compelling artistic documentation of the colonial legacy of the British Empire going as far as the 16th century. No time to visit their collection of modern art which is supposed to be the biggest in South-East Asia, but seems like a good reason to go back.

My friend & I brought our dad's out on an excursion on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year. We thought it would be good for them to reminisce of old Singapore. But to our surprise, our dads didn't know that much about the 2 original buildings -- seeing how one of them is the Supreme Court, I suppose that's a good thing!

Singaporean Citizens & PR's do not have to pay for the general admission, but being Chinese New Year even the paid exhibits were free admission.

As we intended to just have a walk around, we decided to opt for hour-long the guided tour of the buildings. We learned so much about the old & new architectural feats, constraints & ingenuity. Our tour guide, May, was very knowledgeable & peppered her script with personal experiences -- like how she personally voted for the restoration design & the result of which is what now stands.

The tour was fascinating for both locals & tourists in the group. We also got to see selected regional & local artworks along this tour, which whet our appetite to return for the art at a later date.

All the F&B within the National Gallery are interesting, though they look rather expensive.

The building itself was enough to attract me to visit the place.

Maybe because of the magnificence of the building, we had expected more exhibits but were surprised that only a small portion of the whole building was open for exhibition. Unfortunately, due to the limits in budget set aside for the arts in Singapore, quality and quantity of art pieces are generally limited. I feel that the staff really tried their best in making the best out of the situation and appreciate the hard work put into making the exhibit engaging and interesting. Kudos to them.

Service by the counter and exhibit staff was not consistent. I find that the older (in terms of age) staff members were more passionate and friendly in their service, with one of them even approaching us to give us an impromptu brief explanation and walkthrough of the exhibit room which was very helpful. The younger staff members were generally stony faced and show a serious lack of enthusiasm and a whole lot of boredom in their work. When approached with valid questions (e.g. what time does the Gallery close, where the washrooms are, etc.), their answers were not forthcoming and there was a feeling that we have annoyed them with our questions somehow.

The café was really just a hipster hangout spot for people to show how hip they are. Service staff were more interested in talking with their friends who came to visit rather than serving the paying customers and the coffee was below average. Did not try the food so cannot comment on it.

Overall, the exhibits and the way they were displayed deserve a Very Good rating but it was pulled down by the subpar service of the frontline staff.",01-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 13:18:56.920558

""Hallways filled with reminiscence""

There are many things to like about this place but the above phrase really describe my feelings as I explore the Gallery; the long hallways with marbled black and white floors with different galleries lining up on either side.

I will not claim to be a artistic person that can truly value the artworks here but I think that is precisely the part about this place that truly captivate me - you do not need to understand arts to appreciate the goodness in here.

Apart from the Galleries, one can choose to dine here with quite a number of eateries located in one of the wings including the rooftop bar at the terrace which yields you a really good view of the surrounding buildings. Ones with Children also need not worry as there are secured playgrounds and activities to keep them busy.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Preferred Time of Visiting? Early the better (they open at 10am) if you are hoping to catch some shots without the crowds/fuss; you kind of literally own the place to yourself and also enjoy some interactions with the gallery people. From the view that you can gathered from the rooftop terrace which there is a bar located, you will also be in for quite a view if dining/hangout here in the evening

2) Admission Fee? For Locals, it is free for General Admission and cost between $10-$15 if to visit the Artist & Empire as well. Non-Singaporeans will be $15-20 for General Admission, $25-30 to include Artist & Empire as well. I believe Traveler who traveled on SIA (Airline)are able to present their boarding pass for a discount.

3) Location : It is located near City Hall MRT, within 7-10 minutes walk

Verdict :-

Given the accessibility and pricing of admission (particularly for the locals), I would list this as a ""Must-GO""

This is a good indoor place to spend a good number of Hours which makes good backup plan for raining days. It can also cater to a wide audience with its facilities - whether you are in for the Art or curious about some of the featured Historical events or just mindlessly admiring the sleek Architecture; there is bound to be something in here that will interest you.

The building in which SAM is housed was significantly more inspiring than the art on display inside. Here in this museum, we see lots of galleries and corridors with nothing on display, but when one eventually finds the artwork, its good and inspirational. At the time of my visit there were exhibitions by Chua Ek Kay and Wu Guanzhong. I was visiting on National Day, and the admission charge was waivered for the day for foreigners. For Singaporeans, it is free to visit anytime - otherwise they wouldn't visit, given their interest in art being such. The possibility of annual pass for locals who are not entitled to free admission seems to have been overlooked. Despite living in Singapore, I hold a Hong Kong Museum Pass because I enjoy visiting their museums (Art Museum sadly closed presently) and would gladly buy an annual pass to the Singapore National Gallery if there were one.

Art must be inspirational - the first question I ask is ""Am I inspired?"" - after that - if my answer is no, ""Is it likely to be inspiration to others?"" - the answer is usually yes to this even if not to me. The National Gallery fulfils the inspirational draw as far as I am concerned, with most inspiring me personally.

Diverse forms of art are represented, including paintings, etchings, ceramics, puppetry, and mixed media. Inspirational generally. Housed in a very nice gallery which was formally City Hall and the Supreme Court Buildings. Artists are predominantly Asian. An excellent collection, which I hope the museum is building on - we need to fill those galleries, and have maybe a maximum of two closed at any one time for turnaround exhibitions. The recurrence of maritime and tropical themes recur in the artwork - so indicative of Singapore's links to the sea.

It has more restaurants than it needs, but that I guess generates revenue. Good coffee shop. The rooftop is nice for a walk, albeit not too long given the heat. There is a children's department, which is good and offers hands on participation. The building itself is airy on the inside and very pleasant aesthetically. Good air conditioning. Nicely laid put.

I recently returned after a 3 year absence and went directly to the new museum. It was like visiting an old friend who had a major makeover. I still love SAM and its beautiful colonial building and its great contemporary exhibits, but the much bigger National Gallery finally allows Singapore to display its incredible holding of Southeast Asian Art from colonial times to modernity. I had a Filipino friend in tow and we spent hours following the development of Filipino modernism from one gallery to the next. The galleries are organized by time period and it is possible to study any of the SE Asian countries in detail. They also have galleries dedicated to Wu Guangzhou and Chua Ek Kai (my favorite Singapore artist) as well as contemporary Singapore art. The museum also provides an incredible APP that can be downloaded from the App store.

The building is the old supreme court building very elegant--with brass banisters and wood moldings and trim. My only complaint is the layout is very confusing but many guides circulate in the building to help you find various galleries. The app has a map and there are maps in the lobby.

I've lived away from Singapore for over 5 years but make frequent trips home. This was definitely a highlight for me as the Gallery had just opened then.

Proud, in awe of the place and exhibits featured. Something for everyone as it caters to (a) the architecture buff with its beautiful restorations/interior (b) arts enthusiast with its extensive collection (c) photography/Instagram ""addicts"" as there are lots of great angles/areas to take pictures, and (d) families with kids - visit the Keppel Centre for Art Education, pop by the ""studios"" and workshops where kids can sit down and get creative with art.

Ask the Concierge about the guided tours, volunteers will take you on a walk around the two buildings and narrate its history. Did you know there's actually a prisoncell located in the basement of the Supreme Court Wing? Makes for a great history lesson and fab photo op!

My favourite exhibit was the Wu Guan Zhong gallery. I thought placing his works beside Chua Ek Kay was a smart choice as you could see the difference in their brush strokes (to me, literally a contrast to each other) even though there were so many similarities between them. Love!

Suffice to say, I absolutely adore this place. Whether you're a tourist, local Singaporean or semi-absentee Singaporean like me, this place has something for everyone!

Do plan to stay at least half a day as the place is pretty massive. We stayed the entire day btw :)

I'm not an art expert but I didn't find the collection very appealing. All that modern art and installation is just not very exciting to me. Personal taste of course. Having seen the collections at the Lourve, Picasso museum, Vatican Museum, etc, it's hard to feel excited with what's inside the National gallery. Again, just my personal taste. And maybe not a fair comparison. I'm sure others might enjoy the collection.
