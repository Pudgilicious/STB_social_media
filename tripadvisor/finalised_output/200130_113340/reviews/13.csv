It was so hot that I decided to buy a traditional fan. Their new ones were all enclosed in sealed bags so I opened the demo unit to have a look at the size. However, when we picked up the demo unit we found out it was broken. The shopkeeper immediately came to me and blamed us for breaking it and demanded we pay. It was only 2 dollars so I didn't mind paying. But I felt that I was set up and trapped. Worse still after I paid the shopkeeper returned with the change in small coins. I wouldn't be upset if she apologized and said they only had coins. But she looked like she did it on purpose. We all had vacation to have fun, but I really didn't know why she had to give me such a hard time.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 11:34:04.082284

Initially we were skeptical to go to Chinatown as many suggested to visit the one in Kuala Lumpur instead of this. In my opinion, both of very different and both are a must do!

Coming out of the Chinatown station in MRT, the main Pagoda street is filled with shops where you can buy souvenirs or gift articles along with Merlion shaped chocolates. A special mention to the Tintin shop further along the street filled with all sorts of goodies for the Tintin fans. (very expensive though!)

At the end of the street is the Mariamman temple (Indian) which is very big and at the time we went, it was closed, so did not venture inside. Turning right at the end of the Pagoda street and around 100 meters ahead is the Temple of the tooth relic.

We initially wanted to skip this temple, but decided to do a quick look and that was the best decision of the day. The temple is a must see with intricate designs and the tooth relic itself is in the 4th floor.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 11:35:16.701090

Inside the large shopping area are a number of Jewellers Selling Hundreds of items made of gold. I have never seen such a massive area which was all gold items on red cloth. An absolute Eye opener like i have ever seen in my life.
There are a lot of cheap clothing shops and many food outlets to choose from. They are selling all types of food including cooked frogs. Something i have not seen like this before. Food to please everyone.

The main street had lots of brightly colored decorations for Chinese New Year. We went into a large multi-story store that was like a Wal-Mart for Chinatown: they had a wide variety of items, most of them oriented towards Chinese lifestyle and culture.

We walked around and ended up in one of the big outdoor markets, which was fascinating. Also, at one point, we happened upon a big display about Chinese horoscopes for the coming Year (of the Dog)..... it was, after all, Chinese New Year.

There are many shops selling affordable and presentable souvenirs that you can buy home for your relatives and friends. Prices are fixed and they are pretty much the same in terms of goods and prices at most souvenir shops.

There are many delicious and affordable meals that you can have at the Kreta Ayer Food Center. There are a few restaurants on all sides of the lanes surrounding the food center but if you are looking for meals under S$10, this food center is a place to go.

Another place to head to for meals is the People's Park Complex, which is diagonally opposite Kreta Ayer Food Center. Please do not mistaken People's Park Center, which is just down the road, directly opposite Chinatown Point.

People's Park Center has 2 famous traditional chinese dessert stalls and they have a few shops selling cheap accessories for hair, custom jewellery, etc. Chinatown point has many restaurants and small food stalls that are priced slightly higher than food centers but still affordable. There is a DIaso, a shop that sells everything for S$2 at the basement of Chinatown point - another place to go to buy japanese dinnerware, utensils, etc.

All mentioned buildings have their worth of visits.

If you want to do Dim Sum breakfast or lunch, there are 4 restaurants that are cheap and delicious, namely, Red Star, Yan Palace, Yam Cha and Mouth Kitchen.

Places of interests does not include everything Chinese as you will be surprise to know that the Sri Mariamman Temple, is the first Hindu temple and the Masjid Jamae Chulia Mosque is one of the oldest mosques in Singapore.

During Chinese festive periods, such as Chinese New Year or Mooncake Festival, the major road at Chinatown will be decorated to the festive theme.

Personally, I can never get tired going to Chinatown as there are many choices for me to make, be it for meals or shopping - the 2 major past time in Singapore.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 11:41:24.706236

Attire should best be neat short sleeves or shorts or thin cotton clothes as walking around in this low summer weathers mostly will cause you to sweat outdoors. Of course most eateries and shops indoors are fully Air-conditioned for your cooling comforts when your walking around get too warm for your liking.
Evening weather is lower compared to afternoon sunny.
Consider visiting the nearby temples as well as the Heritage trials.
For Budget conscious, you can try the local food in the hawkers centre that serves very nice local food in the Upper 2nd floor of the Market Along Smith Street.
You could try, the chicken rice, Fish balls with or without noodles, either in soup or dry (with or without chilli). They also serves a variety of Cold Deserts & Juices to quench your Thirst after a long walk.
Locals style of food sharing is a common sight. So feel free if you have a group of 3 to 5/6 persons, you can order a few types and share amongst yourselves as a form of food tasting to determine your own taste buds. One man's meat is another man's poison as the saying goes.
Local stalls have gradings too, like those restaurants. It determines their Food Taste in accordance to ratings from A, B, C & D being the worst.

I've lived here for the past 11 years and I can tell you this (I'm a credible source :D) that this place is a nightmare. Prepare to be pickpocketed, shouted at and called nuts in Chinese. This place is absolutely unsafe and unbearably crowded. My advice: this should be your bottom priority on your itinerary.

E.G, I wanted to look at this fan in this stall along the street. It's at a corner, so if you spot a rainbow flag, walk all the way straight until you hit the street parallel to chinatown mall. As I was attempting to close the fan, this extremely rude China lady from the shop yelled at me and said I didn't close the fan properly and that I shouldn't open the fan. Lol you need to know what you're buying, am I right? She spat at me, snatched the fan away the fan from my hand, and to make matters worse, she cursed at me! (I find it outrageous that she dares to slander me, in any case, the law would be on my side, and not some foreigner.)

The layout is untidy compared to the rest of Singapore, and with so many pushy salespersons, you'll likely won't enjoy your time there.

And then, there is China Town. In stark contrast to the rest of the city, China Town is an authentic Chinese area of Singapore, with traditional style low-rise buildings, local temples, and streets bustling with locals and tourists alike.

China Town has a highly concentrated ethnic Chinese population, which means that when visitors and tourists walk through the streets, the sights, sounds, and smells are of an authentic Chinese experience. With small Chinese shop-fronts and traditional restaurants serving local and delicious cuisine, one can spend the entire day getting lost exploring the streets.

There are some Chinese, Buddhist as well as Hindu Temples to visit in China Town. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a magnificent four storey temple, built in the style of the Buddhist Mandala. The temple is a real spectacle of China Town, and many tourists flock to see the two-metre stupa, which is housed on the fourth floor.

The Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the oldest shrines of Singapore and is truly a marvelous site to behold. This shrine is still in daily use for Tamil Hindus in the country and is located on the corner of China Town’s South Bridge Road. You won’t want to miss this expansive temple with its ornate architecture and traditional design.

The highlight of any visit to China Town is undoubtedly the China Town street market located along Pagoda Street and the surrounding area. The street market contains hundreds of little stores, where you can find anything from silk scarves to bags, hats, and accessories. The street market can get busy, with thousands of tourists flocking to see both the local market produce, as well as the beautiful setting. With Chinese lanterns swaying above your head, the most beautiful time to visit the market is at dusk, while the sun sets gloriously behind you, and the shop owners try their best to get your attention, and perhaps lower their prices to make as much money as they can before the market closes.

There are also a few museums and galleries for you to visit in China Town, including the Red Dot Design Museum, which is a modern museum displaying the latest creative gadgets, and modern art design. There is also the Singapore City Gallery, which is a museum explaining how Singapore came to be, and how it grew and developed into the country as we know today.

Why not take a guided tour along the streets of China Town, where locals will show you the best spots to eat, drink and shop as well as explaining how China Town came to be. Walking along the streets of China Town presents many opportunities for you to see and do, with many great spots to take amazing photography of the local population, the buildings, shop fronts and temples.

I will say you will see a lot of Chinese in almost all places in Singapore maybe except little india. So rightfully, all places in Singapore are chinatown.

Over the years, this chinatown has been dominated by mainland China Chinese. Many China Chinese workers gather here in Chinatown for their hometown food and drinks. Food in this Chinatown are mostly China Chinese food. It is not really true Singapore Chinese food. The China Chinese food are also very tasty and unique, but for tourists please do not take it as a true local food. True Singapore cuisine is a mix of Chinese, Malay and Indian food cooking.

Chinatown is a place to shop for cheap local souvenirs although most of it are made in China. There are also few traditional local confectionary and shops that you can only find here. Best period to visit here is 1-2 weeks before Chinese New Year or near lantern festival. Chinatown will be decorated with lanterns and lights.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-30 11:44:34.922816

There are so much things you can do in Chinatown!!

There are three must go temples to visit in chinatown, all worth your time to visit:
Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, a larger size of a Buddhist temple.
Tian Hock Keng Temple, a smaller Chinese temple, with amazing chinese architecture.
Sri Mariamman Temple, a Hindu temple. It is the oldest Hindu temple in Singapore. Extensive with Hindu deities in and around the building itself.

Shopping here is fun!! Bargain is the name of your game. If you don't bargain, its not fun...
It is a never ending bargain shopping from Chinatown Complex through People's Park Centre. Whatever you want to get, you can find it in Chinatown. From pro DSLR camera to a souvenir keychain is available.

Now, talking about dining option here...it is going to be tough. Tough, not because difficult to find a good one, but though because too many good one to choose. From the hawker centres to the swanky restaurants, Michelin Bib Gourmand hawker stall to The Blue Ginger restaurant are there for you.
Basically, pretty much anything you pick will not dissapoint.
If you opt for hawker centre, rule of thumb is just watch the locals lined up, that is the stall to go!!
Place to start to look: Chinatown Complex, Chinatown Food Street, or People's Park Centre.

Explore, and enjoy this awesome ares!@",04-2017,Family,2020-01-30 11:44:42.235033

We waslked around mainly food street and pagoda street to soak up the Chinese New Year atmosphere and to have some lunch. Because it was actual Chinese New Year, most of Chinatown was closed except these streets. Here the restaurants an some souvenir stalls, 2-dallar shops and silk shops remained open for the busy stream of tourists visiting. The roosters, lanterns, and flower decorations were lovely and the children really enjoyed the roosters in particular.

If you're visiting Singapore - Chinatown is worth a visit for a few hours. Beware of overpriced food in a lot of the restaurants though - Service is hasty and can be a bit aggressive - like yesterday when I asked for a glass for my bottle of beer - our server appeared quite outraged to be asked for something other than the beer or food initially ordered! Most of the food has MSG but that seems very acceptable to local Singaporeans. I am sure there are plenty of great places to eat high quality food - do some research if you're into your food!

We settled in for a 'progressive dinner', with me finding the first couple of the dishes then the wife heading off for something different, both taking turns to find something unusual.

It was hot as usual on the day but there were a few bars and fruit juice shops to help cool you down. There also a large harkers above the multistorey under-cover market. They choices there are amazing and you will find many vendor selling the same types of food, so look for the longest line of people. There is a soy-chicken rice stall there which has a massive line - its worth giving them a try.

Things are a little cheaper in Chinatown than on Orchard, so stock up on goodies for the ride back home. Also, watch out which exit you take from the MRT stop. If you dont see a display of lanterns as you exit the MRT stop, you've gone the wrong way. Go back down and look for the other exit.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:48:02.150955

You can also travel easily by the MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) to the end of the line (Tenah Merah Station) where a connection (left platform upon exit) with the East West Line will take you to Bugis (Interchange) station where you have to connect with the Down Town (Blue) Line to end at Chinatown. A short 5 to 8 minutes walk will take you to the new 5 star
Parkroyal On Pickering Hotel at the corner of Pickering Street or the 4 star Furama City Centre which is within an easy walk of Boat Quay and Clarke Quay. For a lower budget you can walk across the street (Upper Cross Street) to Hotel 81 at S$84. There are couple of backpackers’ hostels in Chinatown and one of them is just on the street behind Upper Cross Street. The Backpackers' Inn Chinatown at 30A Mosque Street offers rooms (with shared bathrooms) from S$15.

There are various tour operators in Chinatown and I recommend two of the most popular ones. You can explore Singapore during the vibrant evening hours with a four hour Chinatown tour by trishaw with a guide, visiting a traditional Chinese Medical Hall, travel down stall-lined lanes and walk through the bustling Night Market and cruise down the Singapore River to Marina Bay on a bumboat. A dinner at a local restaurant is included. Or you can choose either a 24-hour or 48-hour hop-on hop-off sightseeing at your own pace on open-top double-decker buses.

Walking Tour Of Chinatown.
One of the fastest ways to acquaint oneself with Chinatown is to go on a walking tour of the shops and stalls on these streets – Mosque Street, Pagoda Street, Trengganu Street, Sago Lane, Smith Street and Temple Street. These busy streets encapsulate all the sights and sounds visitors expect of Chinatown, with hundreds of stalls selling everything from silk robes to lucky cats. There’s also a fantastic range of street food on the malls with fresh dim sum, oyster omelet and crispy duck. If you are more adventurous with food try the second floor Smith Street food court where the locals eat.

I would strongly recommend the walk-about tour of the whole of Chinatown in one or two days. You would have a map (from the airport Tourist Information) and you will find that Chinatown is very easy to navigate. You may start from Kreta Ayer Street and work your way down crisscrossing the streets along the way towards Upper Cross Street and beyond or you could start with Upper Cross Street to the opposite direction.

Next to Kreta Ayer is the big market at Sago Lane that is open during the day, but it looks its most picturesque at dusk, with the lights shining brightly and the sound of stallholders tempting you to check out their wares. Sago Lane had a dark history when it was known as the “death” street. It was where those who come to stay in the dingy houses to wait for death.

Religious Buildings
The other end dings.of Sago Lane at the junction, where there is the big Maxwell road hawker center (reasonable price) on the opposite of the road, lies The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. When entering the gate, you’ll immediately notice the stunning main hall with its high ceiling. The bell tower and solid gold two-metre stupa on the fourth floor which is the place where the sacred relic is kept. However, the main focus for most visitors is the pagoda on the roof that has a large prayer wheel. The temple is built in a style based on the Buddhist mandala.

If you started your walk from Upper Cross Street you will pass by Mosque Street where the Jamae Mosque Chulia is located between Mosque Street and Pagoda Street.
Built around 1830s by Chulia Indians it is one of oldest mosques in Singapore.

Next to Jamae Mosque is the oldest shrine in Singapore – Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the most prominent places of worship for Tamil Hindus in the country.

There is a also Church in Chinatown gazette as a national monument on 23 March 1989. This is the Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church in Telok Ayer Street. Completed in 1924 it is considered as one of the oldest Chinese Churches in Singapore.

At the other end of Telok Ayer Street is the Thian Hock Keng, or the Temple of Heavenly Happiness, is the oldest and probably most interesting Chinese temple in Singapore. Built in 1820, this Taoist-Buddhist temple was dedicated to to Ma Zu Po, the Mother of Heavenly Sages and the protector of sailors. It is interesting to note that Thian Hock Keng was build on the shore of the old Singapore in 1820 and the modern buldings of downtown are all sited on reclaimed land.

Departmental Stores And Malls.
If you are into shopping then go no further in Singapore than Chinatown. Rising above the Chinatown MRT, OG is a household brand in Singapore known for its fashion, jewellery, cosmetics, watches and toys. It is modern and distinctly international – with sports brands and a whole host of Korean cosmetics and imported products. Adjacent to it is the refurbished People’s Park Centre frequented for its textiles, travel agents, electrical/electronic goods, street wear, toiletries and luggage, all priced competitively. It’s a little run down, but most suited for bargains.

The Chinese Departmental Store Yue Wa with its impressive Chinese façade built at the turn of the century that was once the legendary city landmark of the Great Southern Hotel (Lam Thian) Yue Wa offers a wide variety of reasonably- priced, authentic Chinese products - from tea, herbs and medicines to silks, cheongsams, handicrafts and antiques. The quality of the goods available at Yue Wa is definitely better than what you will find when browsing the markets, and prices will only be slightly higher. Yue Hwa has seven floors, with zones dedicated to each item.

Chinatown comes alive during the festive months of the Lunar New Year (January/February) where the streets are dressed and lighted up during the nights. Another lively festival is the autumn moon cake festival. This year there is a blind moon cake tasting contest (on September 4th) organized by the merchants and visitors can have free samples of various moon cakes on display. There is a Lion Dance Performance (free of charge) on every Saturday night at Pagoda Street.

Singapore City Gallery
You will discover the physical transformation of Singapore from a fishing village to the metropolitan city we are today through 10 thematic areas and more than 50 audiovisual and interactive exhibits.
The exhibits span over the first three floors of the Urban Redevelopment Authority building on Maxwell Road, the Singapore City Gallery was first opened in 1999 as the URA Gallery. It was subsequently renamed as the Singapore City Gallery in 2004 after a major renovation.

Opening Hours: Monday to Saturday, 9am to 5pm

Being a Singaporean there are so much more I can tell about Chinatown but I am sorry I have run out of space. Hope the information is well received.

It is not about one long street like other Chinatowns in the World. it consists a cluster of streets, each filled with its own characteristics, immersed in Chinese traditions. The renovated buildings with its old architecture gives you a glimpse of the days of the early immigrants and their struggle for survival. Chinatown is unique because it depicts a multi-religious Singapore even in the early days. A visit to nearby South Bridge Road shows Hindu temple, Mosque and Buddhist temple, helps you to understand how the various races live together in harmony and peace. The recent rennovated Buddhist Red Temple houses the Tooth Relic is worth a visit.
A self walking tour will take about 2 hours with your window shopping not including your meals. It is safe to be in Chinatown and it is good that you wander around and sometimes get lost. But the help is always available to you, free when asking for directions. People here speaks English, Mandarin and some Chinese dialects.Touting is not allowed, and you can verify your bargaining skills in some shops. Enrich yr experience and memories to taste some of the local food stalls along the streets or those housed in food court. Each hawker stall is graded by the local authority for food process hygiene and cleanliness with ""A"" grading being the best.
Many travellers make Chinatown their base of stay during their visit. There are many budget hotels and not forgetting 4 stars stay around the corner. Also food is always available with a reasonable price. A simple meal may costs about S$5.50 with a drink at the local food court. And travel is make easy with local buses, and Chinatown MRT station bringing you to tourists' attractions like Marina Gardens, Orchard Road, Sentosa, Casinos, Botanical Garden, and almost the whole of Singapore.
If you are feeling unwell there is a popular family medicine clinic in Chinatown Point which charges same price as the local about S$28 for consultation not including medicine.
You may find yourself in a busy, big wet market in Chinatown Complex Basement, Smith Street. Take a walk in the morning and you will find big head fish, vegetables and herbal plants, flowers, fruits, and spices. A favourite haunt for the locals.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:48:38.986499

There are so many restaurants and shops, and the whole town is always full of people, tourists and locals alike. It is a good place to find inexpensive souvenirs though some very cheap things are just CHEAP in quality.

If you want to eat well on a budget, there are two big food (hawker) centres: Maxwell Food Centre and Chinatown Complex Food Centre.

We once visited there in January, and found some big tents containing a lot of temporary stalls selling goods for the New Year. It was quite interesting.",08-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:49:04.074963

Overhead they have red lanterns and pagodas here and there. If it's quiet, it's a great scenic place to get a picture taken.

Try the BBQ pork slices. Sweet and yummy! I prefer the Bee Chiang Heng better than Fragrance but hey, to each his on.

Best to go in the evening.
Also good to note that during Chinese New Year, a huge Street market opens up. Best place to buy and sample some delicious local favourites during the celebratory period. It get crazy crowded so during that time, not wise to bring young children, prams or wheelchairs. It's a push and pull crowd.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:49:04.435628

I consider myself blessed to have watched Chinatown's transformation. The old Chinatown was bustling with street hawkers and perhaps a bit more rowdy. Gang fights and rickety wooden staircases from the coolie quarters were a constant fear. When I walked up the dark and rotten staircases, i was fearful that I could slide into a hole.

The now Chinatown is so pristine and many efforts have been made to bring back some vibrancy. Although it has been labelled touristy and lacked the color of the past, it has retained the architectural charm through extensive renovation. If you used to live upstairs in coolie quarters before, having soot from charcoal stoves covering the walls and the lack of toilet facilities, you would appreciate the clean environment. There are perhaps less residents in the coolie quarters. All of them are businesses and restaurants.
Do join a out of the beaten tracks by an internal tour to learn about a certain shop being a slave post, some savory rumors and folklore. Just let your imagination run.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:49:50.546145

There’s a shop near the Temple where they sell bags with Singapore design costing 5 pcs for 10 SGD; for most shops it cost 4 pcs for 10 SGD. I suggest to check all the shops first before buying souvenirs if you are on tight budget. Stall owners are nice and helpful. Luckily we didn't encounter owners pressing us to buy stuffs; they mostly stand there on the look out for any customers who requires assistance. As for the food, there are lots of stalls and we chose the one near the stairs. Delicious and cheap. Chicken noodles/rice cost around 4 or 5 SGD.

Chinatown is more reflective of the real Singapore working class. Crowded, noisy, bustling with a working class population and the less affluent and aged. A place to visit ? YES! See how people work to improve their lot, the enterprlsing nature of the residents, the electric atmosphere of vendors competing to empty your wallet.
For shoppers, there are many bargains to be found, but you have to search for the good stuff, a lot of fun ! Not to be missed if you are touring.

And then there are the singapore popiah, kueh tu tu, muah jee... all nice tasting from my point of view.
But my favourite reason for visiting this place is to change money, the rates are the best so far, ask around shops and bargain to your best rate, don't change at the very first shop unless you are changing less than USD 100.
Lastly, the annual chinese new year decorations around feb every year is a must see.

2. Key chains and magnets are abundant and cheap so visit all shops before u finalize ur purchase.

,1,13,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Carousel7,345062782,05-02-2016,4,Lunar New Year visit to Chinatown,"Chinatown, being a heritage, site charms foreigners with its conservation houses, 5 foot ways and food. If you would like to imagine what Singapore was like in the early 1930s to 1950s, you could catch a little historical glimpse of the place. It is quite similar to the streets of Malacca and Georgetown in Penang in Malaysia.

It has been a while, since I last went to Chinatown, apart from satisfying the occasional dim sum craving. Hence, being able to visit Chinatown again was an experience.

The lunar new year festivities bring crowds from other parts of Singapore to this otherwise touristy area of Singapore. Red Lanterns, decorations, fake firecrackers, red packets throng the streets a few weeks before the Lunar New Year. The festive carnivals boast of Lunar New Year Cookies, crackers, pineapple tarts, oranges and candies to tease your tastebuds. I bought a container of seaweed crackers at $12 and a small little bottle of prawn rolls at $6. I wouldn't say it is a bargain but the taste was rather decent. My past experience buying lots of cookies in Chinatown was disappointing, hence the I did not buy too much this time. You could buy better tasting goodies at the bazaars of the shopping malls.

I went to Chinatown on a Friday morning to early noon and there were many preschoolers visiting Chinatown, as part of their excursion and learning experience. There was occasional rain and drizzle and it was a pain to have to seek shelter in the crowd. Even with a small, lightweight stroller, it was difficult to manoeuvre through the crowd and the humidity was not helping, especially for the 1.5 year old little one. He was restless and uncomfortable. We occasionally sought respite in the air-conditioned shops and not surprisingly, these shops offer better bargains than the pasar malam (bazaar) shops. I suspect the rent for the bazaar is very high, hence transferring the costs to the consumers.

You would have thought bargaining should be easy for a local but I never liked haggling. It is difficult and sometimes there might be miscommunication and you might not get the price you think is reasonable. However, I managed to get a lunar new year suit for my son at $17 (fixed price) at one of the shops. It is of decent quality but I was not able to bargain a single dime off. Having said that, some of the shops had lovely cheongsams (little dresses for girls) at SGD$10. It was a good bargain but it did not come in the right size for my 3 year old.

I also bought some pretty tissue box holders at (2 for $5) and a table runner for $6.90. I would say these are decent buys.

Overall, Chinatown is an interesting place. The weather might be better in the evenings but I suspect the place would be very crowded when people get off work and do their last minute shopping. Expect more crowds this Lunar New Year weekend.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-30 11:52:31.607145

There are many souvenirs and other goods available, but it was the food stalls I found most interesting. From the smoked goods (sausages, ducks, chicken) to the fruit, nuts and seeds - it was a sight to see.

You do need to be aware of pickpockets and there are plenty of warning signs - I did encounter a person who sidled up to me and tried - but had nothing in my pockets and was conscious of him there and on loudly 'hay'-ing him, he quickly moved away. My teenage kids were a bit more concerned after that. As the signs say, so keep hold of your bags and keep them in front of you.

A majority of the food we tasted was wonderful and reasonably priced. If you look at the size of some of the kitchens visible as you walk a long the street you do wonder how they can produce so many disks in a kitchen the size of cloakroom in the UK with just a couple of burners.

A great place to buy souvenirs, have a drink or a meal. I also visited a place where little fish nibble the dead skin on your feet. It's actually very relaxing soaking your feet in a tank of water while the fish do there work especially after walking around Chinatown for a couple of hours on a warm day. There are so many little shops you will definitely find a gift here.

There were so many lit lanterns strung around the buildings and the special holiday stands selling new year's food and trinkets, that the area was bathed in an atmospheric red glow. Lots of people were out looking at the special stands, getting free sample goodies from the vendors, admiring the decorations, and there was good cheer among them all on a busy Friday night. We had already had dinner, so we didn't graze on the Food Street, though it was fairly packed with families having dinner. Since I really enjoyed the area at night, I returned the next day during the daylight hours, and some of the magic was lost. I would not have rated it a 5-star attraction in the daylight, rather only a 4 for the historical significance of the area.",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 11:58:06.181516

The complex is very close and the food centre is at the 2nd floor... 1st floor is just a morning market and shops... so not many tourist will know this.

I was served by Paul who sold me a brand called 'Pro' (NP-FW50 and LP-ESN). Pro NP-FW50 is purported to have 5000mAh and Pro LP-E6N 6000mAh and both batteries are said to be made in Japan. I stupidly took what Paul said on face value and having paid for the batteries, I investigated them on the internet and sought advice from another very large camera store. The batteries 'Pro' are not on the internet and are in fact a rubbish replica of 'Pro Master' from China. The cover on the actual battery is a very close replica of Pro Master batteries, but a deception. I returned to the store and requested a refund. Paul refused a refund but said he would exchange them. For what? He would only exchange for the exact batteries I wanted to return! Beware of this shop. Do your homework before you agree to buy anything, especially when given 'a good deal if you buy today'. If Paul was aware the product was a cheap replica, he deceived me, gave false information and should have refunded my money. If by chance he didn't know it was a cheap replica, he has inadvertently sold me a false product and should return my money and then take it up with the supplier.

Food suggestions:
People’s Park Hawker Center - gets crowded late morning onwards during weekends so be prepared to share your table.

Fragrance Bak Kua (barbecue pork slice) - they can pack it air tight in case you want to bring some home.

Sightseeing
In the evening, head up to the pedestrian bridge to get a good view of the street filled with vendors and light decors.

There is also a famous temple nearby which is a tourist spot. Around that vicinity, you will find a lot of souvenirs at very reasonable prices from keychains to t-shirts.

Telok Ayer Square, Chinatown, Singapore

Chinatown Wet Market is typical Chinese in nature and a part of Chinese Culture in Chinatown. I would associate it of old Sago Lane where the elderly or sick came to stay to wait for the final days. Or as people would call Sago Lane the death street. By 1983 the death streets are gone and the Chinese Market was constructed housing the Wet Market at the basement, the shops on the 1st floor, the food court on the 2nd floor and car parks from the third floor onwards. It was first named as the Kreta Ayer Complex or its Chinese name Nui Che Sui Da Sha meaning bullock cart water complex. In 1984 the name was changed to its present form, the Chinatown Market although its Chinese name remains unchanged. Part of Chinatown proper is still called Nui Che Sui by the Chinese today.
The Wet Market is one of the five great markets in Singapore with its vibrant atmosphere of Chinese ethnic culture. One can find typical Chinese cooking ingredients like Chinese vegetables, herbs and spices. Here is a place to buy live fish, live shellfish and exotic meats such as live frogs, eel, and even turtles. I saw a live snake being prepared. I you want to try frog porridge a stall at the upper food court sells it. With about 700 stalls Chinatown Market is the biggest hawker center and market in Singapore.
One reason why it is called a wet market is because the floor of the fish section is always wet during operation hours. Perhaps Singapore can learn from the European countries to keep fish and seafood in chilled display sections to keep the floors of the market dry and clean.",09-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 12:02:27.851366

It’s got a feeling of being a lovely community with friendly people and amazing smells especially around the food area. Shopping is hard to get away from as they have lots of market stalls in the people’s market. It has around 5 floors ranging from beauty to clothing. We sampled a back massage in the people’s market. My partner said his back has never cracked that much before and although felt like he’d be fighting with Mike Tyson he felt 100 times better. I had a shoulder massage 30mins but felt like I could have stayed all day.

The stalls are repetitive but each have their own style and techniques to draw you in. Friendly people who just want you to buy from them. Felt very safe walking round on my own as my partner was being stood on by a little Chinese man.

There was one section I stayed away from which was hidden away round the back (ladies offering more than just a message )

We ate in a restaurant for lunch which was reasonable. If you want to walk round the religious buildings take a shawl (can buy them from stalls close by for $2) or wear a t-shirt as they don’t allow uncovered shoulders. Beautiful historic buildings.

Singapore is no different, with the exception that a visit will uncover not just all things Chinese but also the food and places of worship of other ethnic groups. Chinatown in Singapore is a cacophony of accents, a place where people of diverse ethnic origins work or live.

First time visitors to Chinatown will find not just Chinese temples but also one of the city's oldest Hindu temples. Among the Chinese temples, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is the biggest. Repeat visitors to Singapore head to Chinatown for a fuss free meal at the world's most affordable Michelin starred restaurant - the self serviced Chef Chan's along South Bridge Road, where a plate of braised chicken rice or noodles costs just S$4.80 (US$3.50). Chinatown is a one stop place for souvenir shopping, from city magnets and keychains to T shirts and merlion ornaments. Visitors also head to the famous Lim Chee Guan pork jerky shop on the ground floor of the archaic People's Park Shopping Centre.

If you happen to be in Singapore during the Lunar New Year (usually in end January of early/mid February) or the Mid Autumn Festival (end Sept or early October), do visit Chinatown in the evenings. The stretch of Eu Tong Sen Street and North Bridge Road between Dorsett Hotel and Chinatown Point will be brightly lit with colourful lanterns. The themed displays change every year and every Chinese festive season draws locals and tourists alike to Chinatown to view the light displays.

First of all this is a must if your in Singapore!

The atmosphere here is hectic but in a calm way, the people here is kind and very polite.

Depending on the time of the day I would definitely say that you should visit Chinatown at evening/night so different then at day in a better way.

Food wise this is a heaven! The quality and the price is probably the best of Singapore, you should definitely try “carrot cake” that’s the National dish.

There is plenty of food court “hawks” in the area where you can find super cheap food and if your planing to go there choose day/evening Because they close relative early.

We read that Singapore has a pretty strong Chinese influence given the origin of a big chunk of the population and this is pretty hard to see at first glance when you walk around Singapore.

Eventually, we decided to pay a visit to Chinatown and we were nicely surprised with what we found, especially now the Chinese New Year had decorated everything wall to wall with the dog motive but, what I found quite interesting were the food and the temples. This area is completely alive at all times, from people playing chess on the streets to the food stands inviting you in with the smell of the food and not to forget the markets, filled with a lot of souvenirs and memorabilia targeted to tourists (although we prefer to not get anything as the planet has enough rubbish around).

Some of the places I would recommend you to visit in Chinatown are:
- Chinatown Heritage Centre: to get to know the history of the region.
- Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum: just go, I honestly can not describe it, get in and be amazed by all the little buddhas.
- The Chinese Street Markets: I think this tends to be the main attraction when someone comes to visit Chinatown.
- And the Chinese Theatres: it looked pretty from the outside, unfortunately, we couldn't get in.

Hope you enjoy the visit :)",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 12:08:18.369139

Because it is a sprawling location and has temples and Chinese restaurants on the edge, as well as malls with the name Chinatown in it, it is easy to go to the wrong place.

There are lots of photos available on the web. The Tourist Chinatown is essentially five interesecting streets filled with shops and stall that are all about 10-15 feet wide.

While to the untrained eye it all looks similar and cheap, there are some genuinely higher quality shops that sell more unusual gifts, souvenirs, or collectibles. One place does a mix of decorative wood and paper fans some of which are very well made and look nice sitting on a mantle. Another specialises in quality lacquered goods.

I would stay clear of the tailors frankly. Tried a few and their materials looked very cheap.

There is a museum there but I did not try it. The Buddhist Tooth Relic Temple is a better cultural resource generally and is opposite a wet market and hawkers site mainly used by locals.

Chinatown Street food is generally clean and some dishes are tasty. But there is also the hawker site at the Chinatown Complex that has between 50-100 food stalls and nearly as many cuisine specialties. Also good, dressier Chinese food can be found on orchard street in the ION mall.

One thing worth trying is the jerky. Several stores sell it along the outside edges of Chinatown. Lim Chee Guam always seemed to have a queue and we tried the pork version which was delicious. Similar to char siu but more tender.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 12:10:00.466221

Decided on lunch & selected the chilli crab at Yucun Kitchen which was a nice meal, in air conditioned premises (or could sit outside to soak up the atmosphere & watch the passing pedestrians). I think about $85 for sring rolls, rice, buns, chilli crab & 3 large beers.

Did visit one of the larger department stores where prices seemed to be the same as home - quality garments on sale but didn't buy anything.

NOTHING!

Cons:
1) Tourist Trap (too commercialized)
2) Rows & rows of shops which sells the same things: cheap souvenirs from china lol
3) Food is essentially rubbish: go to the next door complex hawker centre at level 2 for real authentic Singaporean food
4) Missing Singaporean flavor
5) For a minute, I thought this was walking street in Pattaya LOL!!
6) Real boring: only shops
7) this is a street mall like the many malls & shopping centres in Singapore lol

What to eat? Don't think for a moment this area is 'Chinese Food Centric'. It's has many other food alternatives including the hugely popular varieties of Japanese and Korean stuff. The Maxwell Food Centre is nearby but this is one place of many to eat good quality food at very cheap prices. Some of these cheap food places have Michelin stars so that's how good they are. The waiting time may be a bit long at the prized locations but how many times can you say you ate at a Michelin star spot for $3 (famous chicken rice).

It is also the best place to buy Singapore souvenirs from many shops along Pagoda Street. You can visit Chinatown Heritage Centre on Pagoda Street, and walk along Keong Saik Road dotted with well preserved old Chinatown era buildings. Those interested in viewing Hindu Temple, you can visit the temple not far from Keong Saik Road.
Chinatown can be reached by metro [Line NE4 or Line DTL1 (Downtown Line 1)]. It is very important for you to use Pagoda Street exit (Exit A) to exit Chinatown metro station which would lead you right to the main street, Pagoda Street. If you happen to exit via different exit (e.g. Exit B, C, D, E), you would get lost rather easily. If you are out of these wrong exits, go back into the metro station, and follow Exit A sign to go to the heart of Chinatown, Pagoda Street. I made a mistake of exiting via Exit D last time, and ended up wasting a lot of time to get back to the right place. Don't count on asking people there. Some of them have language problem, and some might just give you a vague finger direction which would not be helpful. The map board on the street is not much helpful, because it shows street names without any indication on where you are. I saw many frustrated visitors in front of the map board because they could not figure out where they were. If this happens, make sure to return to the metro concourse, and look for Exit A sign leading to Exit A/Pagoda Street.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 12:14:06.793679

Whether that's a good thing is up to the individual.

First things first: The shops and restaurants at street level are largely interchangeable. Here a two-minute calligraphy place, there a collection of t-shirts, next to it a restaurant, and so on. If souvenirs are your thing, do remember that very few of them are genuinely ""made in Singapore"", and that prices are at least in theory negotiable. The Chinatown Visitors' Centre would appear to have a better range and better quality if you're in the neighbourhood of the Buddha Tooth Temple.

The trick to Chinatown is to look beyond the rampant commercialism. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is well worth a visit, for example, and there's some very good food to be had on the upper level of the Chinatown Complex, rather than at street level.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 12:14:33.880356

Whilst it is still a great place to get bargains and an great shopping experience there seems to be a new practise of not pricing goods by certain shops and stalls. I think depending on how well off you look they invent prices.
Three examples of unmarked goods.
I enquired about a leather wallet that I knew was $10 elsewhere and was told it was $25.
One shop where I saw an unmarked kimono. When I asked about the price I was told $40. When I said that there was an identical kimono at another shop for $25. the charlatan said he would match the price I declined
Chinese slippers again not priced at another opportunist shop a lot dearer quote than identical slippers at priced shops.

I made the mistake of sitting down for a beer at one of those tables on the road and got slogged a fortune for a Tiger. Visit to look at the old buildings, not for shopping or eating (People's Park is just across the road for those!). People no longer live here, so it is quite different from the bustling local market of the 1980s and earlier with locals sitting at their doorways smoking, and tailless cats everywhere.

Our original intention was to eat at one of the 100's of restaurants but we soon realized that this place is all about the street food venders.

We had crab in black pepper source and a calamari dish. The calamari portion was big and whilst the Crag looked enormous I was expecting far more for $70.

You need to walk up and down the street to find the best good for your pallet. Some of the venders can be a little short and don't speak much English but the experience is well worth the wait.

We got caught up in the new year festive crowd. Could not move it was so packed. Stalls selling all sorts of goods and of course lots of rooster mementos. Have never seen so many stalls selling varieties of nuts!! Food stalls galore if you wanted to sample 'street food' which we did not as it was nigh impossible to get to the front of any stall. Streets to Chinatown were blocked off from traffic as there was going to be all kinds of entertainment. Crowds were so well behaved. We did not stay to watch any of the entertainment, simply too crowded. Our third visit was not what we had planned. We were stopped by a 'tour guide' who was pretty good at encouraging us to visit the flea market which apparently is only held on a Sunday. This time it was still busy but more pleasant. We driven by said tour guide to the flea market where we were met by a gentleman who took us to a jewelry stall. Apparently many regular visitors to Singapore are aware of this stall where one can buy the real deal for less than jewelry exported to SA. Rings, necklaces, the whole range including expensive brand watches. We were heartily welcomed, offered juice/water and a beer for hubby and before we knew it we did a little shopping. Be warned, the lovely owners are excellent and slick sales people but ever so pleasant and likeable. Someone offered to take us to a stall that sold cell phones, iPads etc but we hastily declined.

I'm a huge food lover... for me, the choice was just overwhelming. We ended up having something from one of the BBQ carts, my husband had a 633ml beer and I had a coconut (yep a whole damn coconut) and it cost 34$S for more food than we could eat and amazing drinks - one of them alcoholic.

The selection of food was just unparalleled and the price was the most reasonable we'd found throughout Singapore. Everything smelled and looked great... the flavour of what we had was exceptional.

Aside from the food there are a myriad of colourful stores selling everything from souvenirs to spices to clothing... more. Everything you can imagine. And while these prices weren't the best I've seen in Asia, they're certainly the best I saw in Singapore.

There were large crowds and pretty much people rubbing up against you the entire time your walking the streets, so if this kind of thing makes you uncomfortable, it might not be the attraction for you.

It is well signed that there are pick-pockets at work, same as any area that involves close quarters like China Town, just take the appropriate precautions and you won't have a problem.

China Town is easily accessible from bus line #13 and a few of the train lines pass through there.

Chinatown was alive with colour, music and food. The shops were quite over priced so I passed on the shopping here as I thought other places in Singapore were cheaper.

The food court was our thing its's not for the faint hearted if you are not culturally prepared. Be warned that Singaporeans have a different way that we may not be accustomed to in Australia. They will eat their chicken/protein and leave their remains on the table or floor and this is quite common throughout Singapore and later Vietnam we found.

The food court is on a mezzanine level and the food is the cheapest I have ever seen. It was ridiculous how much food you got for your dollar. So I made sure I got my dumpling fix. We also ate the Micheln starred Soya Sauce Chicken ( see my review) which was worth the very long wait. If you are wondering what the long line is, that;s what people are waiting for.

Of course, be also prepared for the hustle and bustle of crowds, noisy pedlars, cheap souvenirs and clothes.

If you’re a foodie, there is an abundance of restaurants both along Chinatown’s Food Street and many others surrounding the area.

Chinatown is in an older part of Singapore and contrasts with the rest of this modern city ... the buildings are all much older and usually only one or two floors tall and are usually painted in red and gold colour schemes (Lucky colours in Chinese culture).

Once in Chinatown you instantly notice the smells of traditional cuisine

There are ornate Chinese, Buddhist and Hindu temples but mainly shops and places to eat.

This is where the Deja Vu comes into play ... as you walk around, you get the feeling that you have been past this shop before and have looked at the products and wares before ... but the faces are different.

After doing the customary walk around Chinatown, you realise that the shops indeed are different but the stuff for sale is exactly the same ... they could have saved everybody a whole lot of time by just having one shop.

Likewise with the restaurants but as this is CHINAtown, the cuisine is obviously going to be Chinese.

Now I could use this review to do one on Little India and just swap the words Chinatown and Chinese withe Little India and Indian respectively but that would be cheating.

My tip is don't come here on an organised tour as you will not have enough time to leisurely take in the sights and smells ... take the MRT and take your time.",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 12:23:36.634521

I really love the satay stall and cold beer that is served from about 6pm when some of the shops shut and the street turns into delicious food stalls offering all sorts of Singapore yummy food. Inhale the smells, absorp the warmth, listen to the chanter and noise and most of all appreciate the people who work hard everyday setting up, cooking over hot pans and grills and providing a nice smile when they serve you their specialty. The routine is simple, find a table on the street, the beer lady quickly appears and somehow produces icy cold beer, in a minute. While you savour the cold beverage you can decide which stall you would like to sample. You then wander up to the stall and purchase the item and then enjoy the piping hot fresh selection of food, made in-front of you. You can repeat this process till you can't possible squeeze another scrumptious satay and peanut sauce past your lips. Well possibly, you could just manage an icy dessert delight piled high with fruit sauces and colourful tasty things I can't even describe.

Visitors get a quick feel of street eating, while enjoying the sights of Chinatown, well worthwhile doing, its cheap eating, and even tho it's a tourist spot, as a local we would often pop in for a satay and beer.

The stalls/shops do not taut or try and harassed the foreign looking tourists. Prices are very reasonable. The hawkers stall stalls in the multi-storey complex is worth a visit rather than the pedestrian walking side lanes full of food places. The multi-storey hawker stalls have some of the most delicious local food and they are so cheap. The best claypot rice and grilled fish etc is in this hawker complex. There is another multi-storey complex where food stalls are only on the ground floor and that is near the OG complex. The better one is the multistorey where it is with all the malls and side lanes. You can eat like a king and taste lots of different dishes that locals like.

My favourite bak kuah shop is also here in china town. (grilled pork squares that are somewhat like pork jerky but much much nicer!!!).

The souvenirs and stalls are also pretty reasonable. The prices are tagged and on display. You know what you are paying before deciding to buy. In HK and KL and many other places with Chinatown, the prices MOVE up multiple folds once they take a look at you.

Just walking on top of the road (overhead bridge) and landscaped rest area, you get a nice photo shoot of a very pretty street and mingle with locals residents who are there just having night air.

There are a few complexes in close proximity for people who want to shop. Those into gold jewellery, there are quite a few shops nearby. Money changers, watch shops etc and even shoe cobbler!!

This time we caught the MRT to Chinatown station and then exited into Pagoda Street which is lined with shops and stalls selling mainly souvenirs, clothing and bags. We then made our way to Smith Street (Food Street), however it was too early for lunch so we went on to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. I had visited before so we didn't linger for long before we went into Chinatown Point and stopped at their food court. Here we had a lovely refreshing Papaya juice.

After more wandering around the street stalls and purchasing some knick knacks for my grandsons we made our way back to the MRT. There's a little food place with just a few tables and stools outside on the left as you enter the MRT from Pagoda Street and we stopped for some barbeque pork and rice and barbeque chicken and rice and mango juices.

Luckily is was mere minutes away for me from my hotel and so it was an immediate trip to Chinatown as soon as we dumped our luggage in the hotel room.

This was a business trip and I intended to maximize every spare minute between meetings to make the best of this stay. One of my top choices was Chinatown to include the Buddhist and Hindu temples located in the area.

We were dropped off at one of the main side streets near the Hindu temple entrance and made our way down the side street with the intent of getting some great Thai food we had heard about in this area. The rumor about great Thai was true and there are many more restos in this area that can be availed. The food we had was not cheap. At the very least I would consider the food here mid-range in price.

In addition to the many restos available, there are shopping stalls and specialty stores everywhere such as Tin Tin's. The shopping stalls sell just about every imaginable touristy item and nick nack you will find in South East Asia. The selections of cheap house fodder and trinkets are endless and all at fairly cheap prices.

If you look carefully, you can find some specialty shops that provide more interesting and costly works of art for your homes. It is worth taking a look in some of these places as I am sure you will find some amazing items or at the very least give you some ideas.

Chinatown is one of those places that requires a full day to explore properly and I would seriously consider a guided tour if you have the inclination for such things.

Of the two temples the Buddhist temple was a must see attraction. I showed up at the Hindu temple during one of their ""smash-bang"" ceremonies and was pretty much creeped out. More about that in a subsequent review.

I do like the old architecture still present in Chinatown and can just imagine from a few glimpses they are still a few secret areas to be discovered.",07-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 12:29:21.659132

the sales person talked the talk and sounded respectable,he could certainly sell!

So this time when I was there on my own, I decided to check Chinatown out.

The options for good local restaurats are numerous and they are all really good! And the various stores are all worth a peak. And I dont mean the typical touristy shops. For instance, I was looking for Dim Sum baskets to take back home with me so I started asking around for it. A very helpful Singaporean asked me to follow his directions to a kitchen instrument supply store. Now, for an ametuer cook like me, these stores are a Mecca. I spent hours there looking at all the very reasonably priced kitchen appliances. And ended up getting way more than just dim sum baskets. And the bill was surprisingly low and that made me doubly happy. There are many stores like the one I visited and they are all full of treasures.

I recommend to spend a whole day at Chinatown. Have your lunch and dinner there because trust me, you are going to want to eat at mulitple places. So might as well spend the whole day there and get to eat everything you want. And you can always go back there over and over again for more!",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 12:30:47.574722

Here, you can easily go around and shop for cutesy souvenirs that are reasonably priced and there are plenty of food places to try. I recommend allowing yourself at least half a day here since there is quite a bit to do. If you swing by here early morning, make a small trek to Maxwell Food Centre for some breakfast since most of the vendors aren't opened until like 10am or later. After breakfast, take your time in browsing the different vendors and small shops. Most of the vendors will sell similar things at similar prices and there doesn't seem to be much haggling involved.

Some of the major attractions within Chinatown is: Chinatown Complex, the temple, visitor center and etc. I highly recommend stopping by the Complex for lunch / food. On the second level of the complex, you'll find a hawker center that is literally filled with various food stalls. If you like to shop for clothes, there is an abundant amount of vendors on the first floor of the complex that sells only clothes. If you're a tourist and want to make a one stop kind of deal on buying tickets to major attractions, stop by the visitor center. My friends and I purchase our tickets in advance to the Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay and Night Safari there and managed to save money on some small discounts :]. As for the temple, it's really easy to find but do keep in mind that if you visit, shorts and tanks aren't allowed. So remember to cover up with the garments that are provided by the temple at the entrances.

,1,13,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Travelove58,349038745,19-02-2016,4,What to see & do in Chinatown.....,"Chinatown is a must visit place in Singapore. Allocate at least half a day here as the place is quite big & there are many things to see/shop & an opportunity to taste great local food.

Few suggestions on what to see & do in Chinatown (see photos)........

1. Street markets. This is where you can find the cheapest & the widest range of souvenirs & gifts, in Singapore. Amazingly cheap. There are also shops selling traditional stuff/food on both sides of the streets. The exit at Pagoda Street from Chinatown MRT station brings you directly into the heart of the street markets.

2. There are 3 major malls here.

Chinatown Point is a the biggest, nicest & a modern mall definitely worth visiting. It also has the cleanest toilets ( esp the upper floors) & it's free.

People's Park Centre is quite old, with alot of travel agencies but drop by to have a look as it's just across Chinatown Point.

People's Park Centre - skip this if one don't have time. But the Outside of this mall is worth a visit if time permits - as OG department store, the food centre & surrounding traditional food outlets are quite interesting.
This place also has alot of Money Changers.

There is a standalone modern department store called OG, which is a nice place to shop too.

3. Food
There are 3 major local food centres here.

Biggest & the best is Chinatown Complex food centre at Smith Street ( 2nd floor).

Hong Lim Complex food centre ( next to Chinatown Point) & People's Park Complex food centre are much smaller.

A small "" tourist"" food area called Chinatown Food Street is located at Smith Street.

4. For those keen on culture, visit the Chinese & Hindu temples. The Visitors Information office is located next to the Chinese temple.

5. Shops- don't miss the rows & rows of shops lining both sides of many of the streets here. They sell very interesting products, including traditional ones.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 12:31:30.137119

While the city has developed and is replaced by modern buildings, Chinatown still retains it’s original charm.

The main place visited by tourists is the area between Pagoda Street and Smith Street. You can find stalls selling Chinese trinkets, antique shops, shops selling souvenirs, handicrafts, silk, Chinese medicines, goldsmiths, tea houses etc. Many of the shops are selling cheap items.

The Chinatown Food Street is occupied by numerous hawker stalls selling a variety of Chinese and eastern dishes. The Food Street is quite popular and is worth a try.
You can also find here Chinese temples along with Hindu temples and mosques. Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Sri Mariamman Temple and Jamae Mosque are on South Bridge Road .

The streets are always packed and very vibrant too. Outram Park, Raffles Palace and Clarke Quay are all within walking distance. You can reach here by MRT, public bus or cabs.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 12:32:15.347940

Sitting at one of the tables with a Tiger beer watching the world go by, a great pit stop.

So, if you are at all worried about eating street food, or are put off by the name Chinatown Food Street, don't be. It is cheap and it is way better than cheerful, it is fantastic. You can't beat it.

If nowhere else , try the range of meals available at the Chinatown Complex on Smith Street , or use one of the multitude of eateries available to you . I always start by first dropping into the Peoples Park Complex by Chinatown station . Definitely non-touristy , and some great fixed price bargains to be had here , plus more , if haggling is on the cards .
If I'm ever asked in Chinatown ''Where you from ?'' I always take that to indicate that some enjoyable bargaining is on the cards ! On our recent visit my partner was offered a gold chain in Pagoda Street marked at over $1000 , but the price eventually fell to under $400 before we finally declined to purchase the article .

Amazon Cameras & Electronics
11 TRENGGANU street Singapore 058465
Tel : (65)62216640

In Singapore I went into this electronic shop because I was looking for a flashlight on my camera.
In front of the shop 2 men were looking at the tourists passing by, picking those out with a camera, and trying to get them into the store.
The manager in the store ended up showing us a lens and demonstrated it on my camera.
He told this lens was the newest on the market, made in Japan. It would work much better than a flashlight on the camera.
He quoted the price 1600 $ and showed us a (fake) website with a photo of the lens and the price.
He also showed a folder (he had only one) about this lens.
As we were his first costumers he would give a big reduction and eventually we agreed to pay 690 SGD for this lens and a filter.
When we came home, we looked up the lens on internet and found prices for this lens sold at amazon for less than 100 $
Since we were already out of Singapore, we could not go back to this shop.
We send a mail, but of course, no reaction.
The receipt states “no refunds”
I want to bring this under your attention because I thought Singapore was a safe place to buy.
This is a shop that scams tourists. They heavily overprice items, supported by pricing on a fake website.
There was a big stock of these lenses in the shop! So lots of people get ripped off!

Not only does Singapore's Chinatown have the typical old streets full of old shop houses with lots of Chinese restaurants, clothes shops and souvenir shops, but it also has the Chinatown Heritage Centre, a couple of Chinese temples, a Muslim mosque and more than one HIndu Temple.

There are two main Chinese Temples in the area, the first is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple which has it's main entrance on South Bridge road. The other is the Thian Hock Keng Temple which is much older and for me more interesting and which is about 15 minutes walk from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Thian Hock Keng Temple can be found between Amoy Street and Telok Ayer Street.

Back in the main part of Chinatown are the Jamae Mosque and the Sri Mariamman Temple which can both be accessed from South Bridge Road.

Perhaps the most impressive place to visit in Chinatown is the Chinatown Heritage Centre which is a sort of museum showing how Singaporeans used to live in the early days. This museum is pretty large and for S$18 (adults price) you can enter and have a gadget that gives you a full multimedia guide.

One of the very famous places to shop in Chinatown is the People's Park Complex. I remember when I lived and worked in Singapore back in the early 1980's as an expat that this place was a favourite to shop for cheap imports from China.

So if u see the shops selling souvenirs- they are “fake”- mostly stuff sold there are not made in Singapore. If u see shops selling pots and pans & traditional Chinese looking “biscuits/pantry”, these are likely to be real and authentic- trades of chinaman. If u see a Chinese man( with black China pant” - dark tall and funny- using Chinese ink “plein aire” - he is local and authentic. Have a chat with him and he will capture you in his artwork. He is one of the 3rd genreration Singapore ( nanyang)Artist by the name of Tung Yue Nang( and a rather famous and established local artist). You can spend an hour or 2 touring around, and don’t forget to visit the Chinatown Heritage center(if u have time) which will give you a fairly accurate picture of how Chinese suffered when they migrated from China and tolled and how they contribute to nation building of Singapore ( during colonial times and the days leading to independence).

The first time was early in the morning to visit the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. It was quiet and gave me more time to wander around and explore without all the crowds and jostling that occurred later in the evening. Not many stores were open at the time but I was not here to shop. Every block had a plaque describing the historical past of the street which ranged from Chinese funeral parlors, Japanese prostitutes who gave some of their wages to the Japanese government during WW2, etc. it was also surprising to stumble across both a mosque, Jamie, and one of the oldest Hindu temples in Singapore, Sri Mariamman. The Chinese New Year decorations, celebrating the year of the pig, were still on display along New Bridge Rd.

In the evening, the restaurants and stores were open and the streets were packed with both locals and tourists. The Chinatown Complex was closed for renovation (a common theme on this trip) so I went to the Chinatown Food Street which was a covered outdoor food area. The restaurants and stalls had extensive menus with picture boards showing Thai, Malay in addition to Chinese dishes. Souvenir shops were also busy selling all sorts of Knick knacks.

There many activities and bazaars with Chinese New Year goodies.
Please view my pictures which will tell more stories.
Around the area you must visit the Sri Mariammal Indian Temple, The Jamea Chulia Mosque which are historical places of worship and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum next to the Indian Temple.
You want food...no worries many Chinese restaurants at every conner of the streets and Muslim Foods too. Opposite Buddha Temple (across the street) is the well known Maxwell Road Food Court which you can read in my previous submission.
Transport is very easy just hope on the Chinatown North East Purple Line and Chinatown Downtown Blue Line.

As with all historical / heritage areas, there is a touristy element to it. Cheap mass produced souvenirs, touting hawkers, you know what i mean.
But look deeper and you can still find nuggets of treasures. The local authorities has done a good job in preserving the history of the place, and there are a couple of visitor centers and small museums amongst the streets.
Check out the main market building along Smith street. There is a wet market at the basement level where locals shop for daily ingredients from fresh vegetables to live frogs. There is a large food centre with prob over a hundred stalls at the 2nd or 3rd level of the same building. This is where you find the most authentically local food. there are restaurants and also a food street in the area, but they are not as local as this.

The area is very diverse! Though called Chinatown, Buddhist temple, mosque, and Hindu temple can all be found within a short distance of each other. The Hindu temple interested me the most; I have never visited one nor seen a ceremony. When I visited on Sunday around 11am, a Hindu ceremony went on, and I observed. Though knowing very little about the religion alone, I had a great cultural experience! Don’t forget to take off your shoes and socks before entering the temple!

Chinatown has a lot of mini shops all over the area. If one wants some cheap souvenirs (magnets, keychains, T-shirt’s etc), this area is perfect! Magnets tend to go about $2 each or 3 for $5. Most shops will agree to sell you 7 for $10.

The best part of Chinatown is food!!! One cannot miss 1) Hong Kong Soya Chicken, a Michelin starred food stall, and 2) Maxwell food court! There are a ton of food inside the foot court, and the most well known is Tian Tian Chicken rice! Super tasty for cheap! S$4.30 a chicken drumstick plate, and I was so in food heaven!

Got my skin care products at People's Park, a shopping complex, then had 2 bowls of local desserts nearby. A bowl of gingko nuts with logan soup and then to top it all off, a bowl of green bean soup with some sweet potato. I luv it, as it stops the hunger pangs. Then I went across the street to Chinatown Point and got a swiss roll.

Yes, there are many Chinese restaurants and eateries and they are good. This is real Chinese food. No moo goo gai pan, ok? The majority of the local population are ethnically Chinese. Our forefathers came from southern China and brought all their cuisines with them.

There's Chinese medicine shops, shops grilling BBQ pork slices, call bak qua. Fruit stands, small bakeries, cobblers can mend your shoes while shop and eat. A huge department store called OG, has everything from clothes to suitcases. I just bought a pair of silver shoes.

Transportation is very good in Singapore too. Most of us take the subway to Chinatown station. Or you can opt for the bus or taxis.

There's Food Street and it is open in the evenings too. Mostly, local food from all different races. You can sit outside and have beer served to you while you take pictures and watch the world go by. If pubs and bars are your preference, there are plenty of those too.

Just because it is Chinatown, you can find a mosque and a Hindu temple located in the area. Very ornate and popular with tourists. Nearby is also our downtown banking area called Shenton Way. It is within walking distance and you can see the contrast of old and new Singapore!

Don't worry if you run out of cash, lots of banks have their atm here. Moneychangers are plenty too. There are several 3 to 4 stars hotels stretching over a few streets in total.

It is not very big so you can walk it in no time. But if you bother to stop at the temples or the little shops along the five foot way your always discover some thing new.

Unique to Singapore~ you'd find a mosque next to a Chinese temple next to a Hindu temple. Everyone seems to co-exist and it gives the area a rich flavour. You'd need to remove your shoes when you visit the Hindu temple so you might want to bring a plastic bag to carry them around if you are not inclined to leave them outside. I hope you are lucky enough to visit during a festival!

The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple / Museum is an interesting place ~ there is a small exhibition where you can learn about the life of Budhha. Right at the top of the temple you can ask for blessings from a monk. I am not sure what the ritual is but I have seen believers seeking blessings being ""hit"" by what looked like palm leaves.

There is lots of different foods you can try in Chinatown ~ not just Chinese food. My advice is to treat a little of everything so don't overboard ordering too big a portion.

The hawker center has shops underneath it so it's good for souvenirs. If you are so minded for the cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world ~you can visit the chicken rice stall up in the gasket center.",11-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 12:41:33.186682

What is striking about Chinatown is that it is not all Chinese. Here you will find, for instance, Chinese, Malay and Indian places of worship sitting cheek by jowl from each other in blissful harmony, making it possible for tourists to soak up the essence of three cultures in one go.

The current character of Chinatown is partly the result of heeding the call of early conservationists like architects from the early 60s, and the work of United Nations sponsored experts on urban renewal. The messy sights, sounds and smells of old Chinatown are gone, replaced by a somewhat sterile environment packed with swanky shops, homes and offices, and the ubiquitous tourist joints.

Many age-old businesses have been edged out of town due to, understandably, the higher rents for restored premises, but enough remain to make this a vibrant stop for medicinal herbs, dried foods, preserves, antiques and other buys.

Also thriving are restaurants and street food vendors who are holding their own against the influx of upstarts offering ethnic taste sensations from around the world.

Despite its changed character, diehard fans swear by Chinatown when it comes to certain street foods and traditional medicine for authenticity and value.

Attractions not to be missed include:

1. Temple Street packed with tourist souvenir stalls fronting a grand old building with long balconies where residents of yore relaxed watching the world go by, occasionally dropping a basket on a string to fish up some noodle or dim sum from the hawkers plying the street below.

2. The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum draws devotees and other crowds to view its Buddha tooth relic and other sacred exhibits on display.

3. Sri Mariamman Temple is one of the oldest and largest Hindu temples in Singapore.

From a photography point of view, I enjoyed being able to capture its traditional architecture against the modern buildings of Singapore. Tourist buses galore here.
There is then a lovely road to follow called Ann Siang Rd which is to the side of the temple. The beginning of this road is full on tourist tat market. However, if you continue to follow it the road becomes far more atmospheric with beautiful buildings and delicious looking restaurants.

I visited just after having enjoyed a big breakfast otherwise I would have been tempted to eat at one of the very many food stalls.

The streets here are packed with stall upon stall of novely items, jewellery, stationary, clothing and lots of stuff labelled 'I <3 Singapore'. This is a great place to come if you need to buy presents for anyone back home, or want some momentos for yourself. I was in Singapore for Chinese New Year- so evidently Chinatown reflected this, selling decorations, foods and EVERYTHING covered in Monkeys (as its the Year of the Monkey this lunar cycle).
Don't be afraid to barter at the stalls, but generally you'll only find yourself dropping a few dollars off at best. They're much more likely to give you a discount if you're buying multiple items.
After walking around you'll soon find that a lot of the stuff is in every shop you go to, but you will find some great treasures if you look for them. Make specific note of what you found in which store if you'd like to look around and come back later to buy- beause they all start to look very similar!
Chocolate here is cheap!! If you love chocolate, buy it for yourself here- because it's a bit expensive in the supermarkets! Found some great flavours of Cadbury chocolate that we don't have in Australia here and they were a great snack.

Maybe it is due to the Chinese new year lighting which is colourful and decorated with red lantern that make this place special and welcoming. I walk around and also pass by the Buddha tooth relic temple and food centre. There is also a road path with whole stretch of Chinatown street food.

Perhaps some of the highlights in Singapore's Chinatown are the fresh foods market (wet market) and the hawker food centre above the market.

Singapore is well known for its food. And there's no better place to start than the Chinatown Hawker Food Centre. You know it's good when there are queues of locals. Don't be fooled by the no frills looks of the place. Singapore boasts a very high level of food hygiene. And for foreign guests, what makes it easier is the hygiene ratings that are mandatorily displayed at each of the hawker food stalls. Go for those rated 'A', 'B' or 'C'. Bear in mind that the passing standard is 'D'. And... Don't mistake Singapore's Hawker Food Centres for dirty street food that you get in some other parts of the world. Hawker Food Centres is where you see many senior executives have their lunch.. Complete with the suit and ties sometimes...

After having a good meal, take a walk.. First building you'll see nearby is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. Believers can pray there. I'm not, so what interests me is the classic Chinese architecture and the lanterns that hang from the buildings. Nearby are streets of touristy souvenirs and other normal shops.

If you're a kitchen gadget-geek like me, there's a large kitchenware shop called 'Sia Huat' nearby. If it's your first time in Singapore, stop by ""Bak Kwa"" shops and buy a few slices of roasted sweet pork slices. They're delicious and a must-have of Singaporean Chinese during the Chinese New Year season.

Further down the road is a Hindu temple called the ""Sri Mariamman Temple"". They're open to visits by people from all walks of faith. But be respectful. Take off your shoes and place them neatly near the entrance. Just do what the locals do.

Right beside the Hindu Temple is a Muslim Mosque named ""Masjid Jamae"". Singapore's a multi-cultural, multi-religious country. We're happy having our brothers and sisters of other faiths right next door. It's how Singapore is.",01-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 12:44:26.001461

I also got a haircut in a salon at People's Park Complex and was satisfied with playing $22 (without wash).

The place bursts to life in the month around Chinese New Year, where the shops and temporary stalls are stocked with festive decorations and other goodies. Expect, definitely, crowds, and beware of pickpockets.

There's a famous ""bak kwa"" (sliced barbecue pork) shop near the major bus stop along Eu Tong Sen Street, called Lim Chee Guan. People queue there for hours to purchase boxes of the stuff around the New Year period. You're probably better off visiting the shop in the off-season, usually from March.

The planner in me, of course, had already plotted my way through Chinatown. There was also no better way to see Chinatown aside from walking, so that you can soak up the culture and the architecture.

I found myself starting my journey to the Thian Hok Heng Temple (Taoist temple), then making my way to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (Buddhist), and not far from it was the Sri Mariamman Temple (Hindu).

Aside from the temples, I enjoyed seeing the Chinese lanterns all put up along the streets since Chinese New Year is coming up soon. No Chinatown trip is complete without immersing yourself in the Maxwell Hawker Center -- home to Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice (which has a Michellin Star btw).

I did make it over to the famed Maxwell Center for lunch (separate review), it is a block from the Buddha Tooth Temple.

I took a short taxi ride from my hotel and kind of went with the flow with no plan in mind. China Town is a maze of streets. My first impression was ""oh dear"" when I was confronted by an adult shop, which made me giggle, but thankfully it was the only one I saw. Thereafter it was all about nic-nacs and trinkets. Don't be fooled into thinking everything is cheap; they aren't. It pays to look around. I found one bracelet that I thought about buying for my daughter which was quite expensive. I moved on to find another one about 30 minutes later that was 80% cheaper!

There are the odd $1 shop, and other more touristy types blended in. I even ran into an Indian tailor that Bill Clinton had bought a suit from.

A great place to go. I wanted to try some market food but opted not to. Other tourist sites (temples) etc are nearby.

Singapore’a Chinatown district is no different. I will try not to repeat the must do things which you would probably find on other sites and just say that if you’re not travelling with young kids, it might be worth spending a day to really discover and uncover hidden gems over here.

You won’t be starved of:
a. Cultural sights: there are various places of worship here (please be mindful and respectful of decency and decorum when you’re visiting) such as Masjid Jamae mosque (Mosque Street), Sri Mariamman Temple (oldest Hindu temple in Singapore) and Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, both located along South Bridge Road.

b. Culinary delights: there are Hawker centres (Maxwell, Chinatown, Peoples Park and Amoy Food Complexes) for the Budget conscious where you can get a very decent meal inclusive of drinks and dessert for USD10, all the way to the restaurants dotting the entire area

c. Instagrammable spots: People’s Park Centre, Chinatown Food Street, City Gallery (at the URA visitors centre, and don’t forget to check out the cafe next to the building only selling books by Singapore authors), the iconic public housing project called The Pinnacle, shophouses along Keong Siak Road and NUS Baba House.

d. Quirky things to do: Get a foot pedicure at the Alleviate Fish Spa (close your eyes and don’t look if you’re squeamish but fish basically eat the dead skin off your feet), stay at the New Majestic Hotel which only has 30 rooms, each featuring art installations by local artists and check out the merchandise at The Tintin Shop at Pagoda Street if you’re fans of the iconic book series",08-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 12:49:58.354194

,1,13,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/DavidB22117,694611148,01-08-2019,4,Avoid the tourist food in Chinatown.,"Hi folks. Well I’ve lived in Singapore on and off for 23 years, and I love Chinatown. However there are a couple of places to avoid, unless of course you are a typical tourist with big pockets.
One place to avoid for food is Smith Street, yes it’s nice and now totally under glass that spans over the shop houses on both sides, but it is a tourist trap for expensive food. Well maybe not expensive for you, but not that many locals eat there, the place thrives on tourists. So what to avoid, well for one it’s Chilli Crab, it’s meant to be a Singapore delicacy, but to be honest it’s just a crab covered in chilli sauce, very messy and very expensive. There is a Thai place in Smith Street and also a Vietnamese food place, neither very good or authentic, it’s tourist food, plain and simple.
The alternative is to go across the road to People’s Park and eat in the Hawker Centre. It is full of locals so that tells you something.
There are some nice little streets around Chinatown, go down Pagoda Street to the Chinese heritage centre, walk around inside one of the old shop houses to see how all the Chinese lived once they arrived in Singapore from their home country. One of my old Chinese friends was brought up in a room in a shop house, and he said it really was like that when he was a child, worth a trip.
Next to Sago Lane is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum, worth a visit, very bright and ornate inside. Don’t worry if you are in shorts or a tee shirt ladies, they have clothes for you to cover up so you don’t offend anybody.

Across the road from there is Maxwell Food Court, lots of different foods to try and a very famous local Chicken Rice still, all at local prices, $5 will get you a good meal. $7.50 will get you a large bottle of beer.

Have a walk around the side streets, lots of little stalls selling gifts and bits, you can even get a suit or shirt made, but not the same day.

Hope you enjoy it, it is nice, just check the food prices before you order. Oh and don’t forget the restaurants costs are all plus plus, what you see add 10% service charge and then 7% GST.
It’s best to stick to the Hawker Centres and little coffee shops really.",05-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 12:49:59.737947

To Singaporean’s, the Chinatown today is “too PRC” and has lost much of its old Singapore Chinese feel - the feel of the old days where immigrants from Southern China made Singapore their home. But from another perspective, what Chinatown is today is reflective of the constant dynamic change of the Chinese diaspora found in Singapore (and around the world today). So, head down and just immerse yourself in all things China Chinese - hot pots, mala dishes, skewered meats, etc. And of cos, don’t miss out the Hindu and Buddhist Temples around. Such an eclectic mix of culture is perhaps a good reminder that makes this Chinatown a uniquely Singaporean one (and of cos, some might argue, a Malaysian one too).",04-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 12:50:33.712835

A tourist can spend half a day here and I always bring visitors on such a itinerary as below.

First, start off the day with a Michelin star hawker lunch at Liao Fan Hawker Chan (78 Smith Street). Go at 10:30am when they open so that you don't have to queue and wait up to one hour for your food.

Next, turn left when you leave the restaurant and roam the streets for souvenirs. Remember to buy some Merlion themed souvenirs since they are unique to Singapore.

Visit a museum or temple in Chinatown to see for yourself how Singapore was like in the 1960's.

Finally sit down either in Yum Cha restaurant for traditional dim sum or one of the many seafood open air restaurants and reward yourself with chilled Tiger beer.",02-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 12:51:22.182378

Lots of shopping, places to visit, and what look to be some dodgy places to eat (don't let the outside discourage you....some of the best food you eat, and very cheap).

Food and family is big within the Chinese community, and if you find a restaurant with lots of locals inside, give it a go. There is sooooo many choices, you could spend weeks eating down the street and not have the same thing twice.

Two things I found on my last trip were rather memorable....Bakkwa(which is like jerky for the westerners) and Snow Beer. Don't be scared of how Bakkwa looks...as you walk down the street, you will most likely be accosted by a man or woman asking you to try this odd looking meat...once you try(and there are lots of different types), you will be hooked. Snow Beer is a Chinese beer that is quite light to taste and when ice cold, is very refreshing in the middle of a hot day.

I didn't expect to be impressed with Singapore's Chinatown after being away for 20 years, I mean Singapore is mainly populated by the Chinese, so isn't everywhere ""Chinatown""? But I'm happy to report that Chinatown is one of my favourite places in Singapore to take friends to when they visit and a place I sometimes opt to go to with the family to hang out and have dinner. I like the atmosphere there.

Chinatown, aside from the expected gift shops of low priced items to buy as souvenirs, is also full of places to eat from the local dishes to seafood specialities with the abundant cafes and restaurants. One inevitably will find something ""cute"" to purchase or a new dish to try. The young love Chinatown as the shopping on offer extends to shoes and clothes. Those who visit Chinatown are not all tourists and that's what great about it. There are performances every now and again by local young artists and other interesting events organised including the ""50cents week"" where all the food at participating outlets are priced at 50cents!

There is a hawker centre feel to the eating section at Chinatown and one is spoilt for choice in terms of food options from all over Asia. Beer is cheap and you get to choose to eat out in the open (sheltered area) or inside the cafes/restaurants.

Chinatown does get busy during months preceding the Chinese New Year and the Autumn Festival and lavish parades are held to mark these celebrations. The decorations are delightful during these months.

I'd definitely recommend a visit. It's location is also very central and easy to get to with the Chinatown MRT right in the heart of it. From Chinatown, you can get to other ""must see"" areas within walking distance or quick MRT stop away.

The streets are narrow yet the buildings are streamlined and very neat. Yes they are functional buildings. There are shops of all kinds.

The good thing on our visit was, there were very few people around so I didn’t see it as an exploited area that tour guides are bringing people to flock at.

They also have a Chinese temple and all these wall arts depicting the way of life or manner of living.

Back in the 70s and 80s, Chinatown was filled with all kind of activities: the lively open-air market selling fresh daily produce, numerous coffee shops and restaurants serving local and Cantonese delicacies and all kind of Chinese festive events offering much joy and laughters.

However, after Chinatown underwent a major overhaul back in the 90s when all the local residents, retail outlets and F&B establishment were re-located or closed.Replacing these old retail shops and F&B outlets are tacky tourist souvenir shops and fast food restaurants like MacDonald. Due to a hug influx of foreign workers and migrant from Mainland China, Chinatown has also become a favourite hangout for these Chinese national. As such, numerous F&B outlets catering to their appetite were opened serving all kinds of food from the various provinces. Hence, the local indigenous flavour has dissipated completely over the years as a result.

The Chinatown nowadays has become very cosmetic and artificial without any traces of the sight, sound, taste and smell of the Chinatown that I remember from my childhood days.

Its Chinatown, located in the central part of Singapore, has significant historical and cultural meaning. Although the majority of present-day Chinatown was built over the 1820 to 1929 period, even before 1330, there was a Chinese community in Singapore.

There are many attractions here. The major attractions include the Tang dynasty architectural style Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum which opened in 2007, the Tamil Hindus Sri Mariamman Temple which was completed in 1827, Chinatown's very colourful street market, Thian Hock Keng temple (aka, Temple of Heavenly Happiness), Singapore Coin and Notes Museum, and more. My favourites are the first three listed above.

After exiting the Blue Downtown Line MRT station, exit A, you're plopped right in the center of it all. Clothing, table cloths, trinkets, toys, costume jewelry, fun knick knacks (you *need* a waving money cat! you do!), keychains, luggage tags, t-shirts, lanterns, and oh...I could go on and on. Many merchants are very happy to talk to you. Lots of them will guess where you're from. You can have a chat, debate over souvenirs, and then meander over to see the temples nearby. Afterward, head over to a food stall, a sit down restaurant or even the food court to try some flavorful eats or refresh with an iced tea or cold brew. The sights, sounds, colors and people are amazing. So much to see, the cultural center, the temples like I said (but dress modestly to visit, please), and all the wares that are symbolic of the truly international merchant magic of this tiny but massively important island nation. Really a great place! Notes: Dress comfortably to wander through crowds, uneven surfaces. If you don't bring a stroller that would be best. Keep an eye on kids, they might want to grab all those colorful things. Carry your own bottled water or buy from a vendor. Wear hat/sunscreen because on sunny days it can be rather equatorially roasting at times, though in the shade of a shop it's fine. Have fun.",02-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 12:55:15.846971

If you are around for Chinese New Year it can get very busy, particularly at weekends. As more MRT lines are opening in Singapore getting here has become much easier. There are also lots of bus routes that will deliver you to the destination. Much of Chinatown is around Pagoda Street and their are lots of small shops selling a very wide range of interesting merchandise. If you don't look Singaporean, and with such a diverse population who does, you will certainly be approached by tailors offering you new suits, trousers and shirts. If that is what you wish to purchase then fine but if not it can be a nuisance. On the corner of Smith Street and New Bridge Road there is a department store called CK (nothing to do with the underwear company) and upstairs a Chinese Supermarket called Da You, always worth a visit. A sad part of the visit is the old Majestic Theatre. The facade is still there but inside it is often used for market stalls. It featured in a Singapore movie of the 1980s called 'Forever Fever'.

However in Singapore, over the decades, it has become an interesting ""melting pot"" area for people of all races, cultures and religions, to live and manage their businesses there. Hence the area has become interestingly colourful, very often providing tourists and even locals, an incredible experience of diverse origins.

Just food alone, it was a paradise for anyone, spoilt for choices, to enjoy cuisines not only in different styles, but at different ambience and levels. For simple hawker food, there is the iconic Chinatown Complex Market & Food Centre along Smith Street, providing vert affordable yet delectable traditional food of Chinese, Indian, Malay, Eurasian, etc origins. This is the place where the world famous lowest cost Michelin Star chicken rice store, ""Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle"", is located, starting less than SGD 4.00 a meal.

Then you have the famous Sze Chuan Spicy Hot Pots along the main North Canal Road, One Michelin Star Asian fusion ""Meta Restaurant"" along with World Top 50's Australian style ""Burnt Ends"" restaurant and the famously long queue Japanese Inagi Donburi ""Man Man"" at Keong Saik. Not forgetting the popular Malay style Nasi Lemak at Kreta Ayer.

Apart from all the foodstuffs, the whole area is dotted with brilliant colonial times architectural buildings which the local government has invested huge resources to restore and maintain. Furthermore, places of interests include the huge buildings of worship like the beautiful Chinese temple - Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, the Indian temple - Sri Mariamman Temple, both along South Bridge Road. Also smaller but significantly ones like Thian Hock Keng (Telok Ayer Street) and Sri Layan Sithi Vinayagar Temple.

For tourists who are looking for signature local produce to bring home, at various part of Chinatown, especially along Pogoda Street and inside the Chinatown Point Shopping Mall, they can be easily bought. Such as Singapore's famous sweet BBQ pork slices can be found with Fragrance Foodstuffs or Bee Cheng Hiang, or traditional chinese medicine with Hockhua Tonic or Yue Hwa Chinese products.

To make visiting easier, tourists can book their accomodations with the huge number of hotels, both mainstream, boutique and even backpackers lodge, in and around Chinatown. The whole place is so easily accessible and always bustling with activities.

Visit during Chinese New Year or Autumn Festival periods for even more memorable fun!

You will see most of the old buildings that has been preserves and still in use for shops and restaurants. Like most Chinatown in the western countries, you can also find inexpensive arrays of souvenirs, from key chains to antique Chinese chest drawers. There are two areas of Chinatown, the touristy bit and more of the local bit. In the local bit of it, you will find the Michelin starred food hawker, at People's park food court.
On the touristy bit, there's an old but well maintained Buddhist temple, the Tooth Relic temple and museum. You want to visit it, even for the architectural side of it, if nothing else.
On Buddhist holiday, the temple is decked out and filled with the worshipers and tourist alike. Also, there's Tintin museum to visit. It's a small establishment with this famous comic's memorabilia. Or have yourselves a tailored shirt or the full suit while you visit.
The ambiance is festive with lampions hanging overhead from old preserved buildings along the Pagoda St. Try to look beyond the souvenirs and the restaurants, you'll see the richness of the Chinese culture and how it contributes to the whole multi cultural aspect of Singapore.",08-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 12:56:45.231636

Part of a heritage area, with temples and close to other areas. It was given conservation status in July of 1989 and has four distinct sub-districts which forms part of the greater town (Da Po). Great for an afternoon walk or stroll.

This Chinatown is certainly well maintained and kept in clean pristine state, but that is the norm for Singapore.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 12:57:21.078884

There is an over pass foot bridge that can take you to the People's Park plaza and there many local eat there food.

Honestly, it's one of Singapore's most colourful and delightful sight.
It's a definite to-go and experience site not to be missed by both tourists and locals.
The food, the artefact, the bargaining, the air around it, it all very exciting.
From local street food to Mongolian fare and of course, Singapore's most famous dessert store at the corner of Temple street and New Bridget Road (Mei Heong Yuen).
One has a choice of dining alfresco or in air-conditioned eateries/restaurants.
The China-imported souvenirs are literally cheaper than in China itself. A total bargain without bargaining and this is my personal experience.
I would love to make more weekend walk-around Chinatown and savour each and every street store especially the satay and prawn noodles.
If one is energetic, divert to Ann Siang Hill, Club Street area (a stone's throw away) to enjoy the bustling restaurant outlets ranging from good old Nasi Lemak (The Coconut Club), to Tapas at Lolla where the Uni with Black Pudding is to die for.

It is conveniently located on the MRT and you come up right in the middle of it. If you go on a rainy day, you can mostly stay covered walking shop to shop. The first time we went was to meet some local colleagues for lunch at the China Point mall (DTF - highly recommend) & shopping at China Town, the second was to take another visitor to try the same restaurant and shopping, and then the third was to pick up the item I missed due to my indecisiveness on prior visits. Compared to other markets in Asia Pacific (like the weekend market / Asiatique in Bangkok), this one is not as big or good - however we obviously liked it enough to go multiple times. During our first trip, we also stopped at a shop that sells Durian (which conveniently provides gloves to protect you from the smell) and two of us tried it for the first time. Very cool experience (does not smell or taste as bad as expected), but be forewarned, the Durian is not cheap since it is imported like everything else in Singapore. We spent $75 Singapore for one Durian and 8 delicious juice drinks (watermelon, sugar cane, and coconut). I also wanted to buy an original glass Christmas ornament that had classic Singapore scenes painted on the inside (Merlion Park and the Marina Bay Hotel). It was priced at $18 and I ultimately paid $15. The reason for sharing this is that the ornament caught my eye during the first visit and I therefore meant to buy it the second time, but when I stopped by the shop after 9pm, sadly the shop was already closed - I therefore had to go back. My advice, if you see something unique that you want to buy -- get it then. Also, it is very hot during the day but quite pleasant in the evenings.",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 12:58:50.188062

These busy streets encapsulate all the sights and sounds visitors expect of Chinatown, with hundreds of stalls selling everything from silk robes to lucky cats. There are plenty of ‘Made in China’ goods on display and lanterns swaying in the breeze above your head. You must try food from the fantastic range of street cars amongst the many market stalls- crispy duck looks good and fresh dim sum is a must. The market is open all the day, but it looks its most picturesque at dusk, with the lights shining brightly and the sound of hawkers tempting you to check out their wares. You must try your bargaining skills to get a better price but remember to do it with a smile.There are ornate Chinese, Buddhist and Hindu temples, museums galore and plenty of opportunities to soak up the bustling streets lined with old shop houses.

Caligraphy and Chinese paintings, auspicious paper cut-outs, push cart ice cream vendors, Jamae Mosque, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple & Museum, Sri Mariamman Temple (Singapore's oldest Hindu temple), medicinal halls, family-run goldsmiths, teahouses, bak kwa (meat jerky) stations.

These are found along cramped five-foot ways, dingy alleys, shady backlanes. Raucous street hawkers on narrow streets - out of place among hipstar bars and lifestyle retailers.

There's even a Tin Tin outlet.

And funerary paper offerings that Chinese believers burn for the deceased to ensure them a happy afterlife can be seen in shops in the form of laptops, money, mansions, cars etc

This is mostly a outdoor walk, but most shops have awnings enough to cover your walk in those random 15 minute rain showers. There's a lot of vendors selling the usual souvenirs like pens, magnets, candy, paper fans but just wander around each block to see a bit of everything. There's a few vendors selling in season fruits, for September that's grapefruit and the end of durian season. But there's always some fruits on sticks or smoothie like blends to be sold. There's restaurants as well so no one will starve. Hawker center that's not obvious, but there's a building in the middle of the area; just ask and people will kindly show you the way. No AC there but the food is worth it.

There's a popular beef jerky place called Lim Chee Yuen for the people from TW/HK, sometimes no line or it can run 15 deep when I visited. They happily offer sample tastings, but if there's a line better decide quickly what you want.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 13:01:15.526828

There isn't much unique Singapore souvenirs that I could buy, a lot of it is random and you definitely can get it cheaper else where. I definitely have seen a better Chinatown, therefore am a bit disappointed.

The dishes that is around the area is ok. It is definitely not that cheap, but I recommend that you try out the Spicy Crap dish! its spicy, juicy and very well seasoned.

In Chinatown Point:
Basement 1 lift lobby area. Look for The Golden Duck. If in stock, these sell out salted duck egg coated crisps are to die for. Full of umame. You can't stop until you've finished the packet...and it's a large packet!
Basement 2. Look for Pure Pandan. It sells the most wonderfully-light-as-air pandan chiffon cakes. I had a slice and wish I had bought the whole cake. Tip: I declared it at Melbourne Airport on entry and IT IS ALLOWED!
Outside, look for Lim Chee Guan and Bee Cheng Hiang for their bak kwa (barbequed pork slices). Even if you don't end up buying anything, they will give out samples. Another tip: the sealed packets of bak kwa are allowed into Australia. Up to 500g. Just declare it. Even the custom officers know it as bak kwa!
Wholesale kitchenware alert at Sia Huat in Temple Street. If you have a lot of luggage allowance, this is THE place for all things wining and dining.
Chinatown Complex food market in Smith Street. A food stop housing even a Michelin-starred hawker stall. It's hot and humid. But it's good. There is even a beer stall in there which must have like a hundred different beers by the bottle!

But you may be tempted to linger at one of the many souvenir shops (trust me, the prices are mostly similar. those with cheaper price may not have the best quality), restaurants, cafe or perhaps just taking photos at the various hotspots. Not a terrible big experience. But if you're from a country with very little contact with Chinese people, then this is it.

Singapore Chinatown is losing its culture, you wont find cheap food there and it is overcrowded by foreigners especially national from China!

There is a hawker centre at ground floor and retail shops located at level 2 onwards.

Some stalls are still run by locals but many are runned by China National. In which is pretty common in Singapore now as less locals want to work as hawker due to long working hours!

The air conditioned shopping centre called People's Park (珍珠方) is also famous for overpriced goods. Bargain hard if you are buying!

,1,13,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Rupert1200,348717897,18-02-2016,3,Still retains some charm...,"If you are travelling to Singapore, you may wish to take a morning or afternoon in Chinatown. As a tourist, the most interesting places are those with a bit of history and all within close proximity are the Sri Mariamam temple, a very old mosque and a number of Taoist temples. The streets themselves have been somewhat sanitised over the last 10-20 years but retain some of the original feel that they must have had years before.

If you want something more 'earthy' then the streets of Penang or Malacca are more likely to satisfy the true historians. Nevertheless, the great advantage of the Singapore version is that there are plenty of English-speakers to hand and they are always quite warm and friendly.

Try not to be too intimidated by the numerous requests from shop fronts to step in and try their wares, try a new suit, avail yourselves of their delectable food etc. Most traders will stop if given a polite smile and a ""no thanks"". There are quite strict rules about what traders can and can't do and they are aware that if they overstep the mark they can be 'blacklisted' by Singapore's highly effective Tourism Promotion Board. There are some 'bad eggs' but they are definitely in the minority.

What to see and do? It's really a matter of taste. If you are a foodie then there are some really good eateries both here and close by in Clarke Quay and Boat Quay. Singapore has a rightful reputation as a food paradise and you'll find really satisfying food in some of the most humble locations. I tend to go for 'coffee shops' which are like little collectives of traders selling numerous different dishes. Often there is a change of stallholders as the day goes by with a group of breakfast, lunch and dinner traders all working away in quite tight confines.

Visually, Singapore's Chinatown is an exciting blend of old and new. There are traditional shop-houses close to brand new shopping malls. Transport is easy thanks to the MRT 'metro' rail network and easy to board buses. The transportation network utilises a cashcard type system (very similar to Oyster cards in London - although Singapore got there first). You can get single journey tickets on the trains but it is a much better idea to get a stored value card because then you can plan your own bus and train route with numerous transfers.

I tend to go to China town about 2-3 times a year these days. It is great to go for the Chinese New Year Celebrations and the Mooncake festival as these bring out large numbers of locals and tourists alike. The crowds can certainly swell - especially over the Lunar New Year - but that is half the fun. My favourite treat? A roast pork delicacy known as as Bak-kwa (it is often spelled in a variety of ways but if you get the pronunciation right no-one cares). It may look a bit odd at first but, trust me, it is a real joy. Locals describe it as 'heaty' and will often tell you not to eat it if you have a cold (based on the idea that there are foods that are 'heaty' and 'cooling' respectively). Keep an eye open for durian too when it's in season. This is the famous fruit that one either loves or hates. It has a distinctive odour as does its cousin the Jackfruit. I rather like it but I must admit that I cannot eat too much. The flavour is nothing like what the smell suggests and if you get a good one (believe me you can become a connoisseur of the various varieties) then it results in a creamy, rich and flavoursome experience. Oh, and watch out for the result later. After eating durian, it is very common to get a little gas. Every time you belch, the flavour comes back!

So, why just a morning or afternoon? Well, it really is your choice but Chinatown is very self-contained and after about 2 hours of wandering and browsing you'll get a sense that there is not much more to see. You'll also be either very hot or very wet as our equatorial climate can be a bit punishing to say the least.

For shoppers (especially textiles) pop across the road to People's Park Complex. This is also very close to one of the MRT entrances and in the complex itself is a food centre as well as numerous small shops selling all sorts of fabrics for the home sewer. In the large air conditioned shopping complex adjacent to this you will find numerous camera and electronic goods stores as well as travel agents, nail bars and massage stations. The latter are an acquired taste. Most are expensive and offer very little therapeutic value. If you are looking for a really good deep tissue massage you'd be better off going to one of the hotel spas. Beware the 'other' type of massages. Along a number of Chinatown streets (usually on the upper floors) you'll see ""massage"" advertised. These are very much for the ...ahem...sensual traveller if you know what I mean.

I could go on and on. All in all it's an atmospheric blend of old and new. You'll get to hear Mandarin, Hokkien, Cantonese and 'bazaar Malay' mixed in with bits of English. You'll see garish and rich colours, you'll smell Bak Kwa and durian, and taste all sorts of cheap and tasty food. A nice break from the overly air-conditioned hotel lobbies and shopping malls.",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 13:04:26.643642

What interested me though was the juxtaposition of the old and new. Some of these old buildings are beautifully restored with a new twist to the activities that goes on within it. Experiencing the activities was one thing. Understanding the history behind it was another.

Found this app TimeTracks SG50 that brought us through the history of Chinatown. All at our own pace and time. With augmented reality, a mini drama on how life was like then and some in-depth details of the origins of Chinatown. I got an enjoyable 30min historical tour of Chinatown right on my phone!",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 13:05:03.786155

Hindu Temple, Mosque, Buddhist Temple, and a large China town styled market.
It is a very good place to visit.",07-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 13:05:04.477505
