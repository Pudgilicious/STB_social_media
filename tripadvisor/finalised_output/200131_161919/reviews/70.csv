It’s flanked on either side by traditional shophouses, many of them prewar. The shophouses at the base of the hill are used for commercial purposes - a few bars that can get quite busy in the evenings and at night. But further up the hill, once you’re past the school on the left, the street becomes very quiet and residential.

There are some really beautifully restored shophouses along the way, well worth the 5 minute walk up. Where Emerald Hill levels out the houses start getting a bit bigger. There are some sections at the top of the hill which are post-war though (apparently these sections were rebuilt after being damaged during the war) and they don’t have as much charm.

Beautifully maintained old houses in a quiet street mostly in the Peranakan style, most of them occupied and living spaces. Reminded us of the side streets in the Heritage centre of Penang, but much cleaner, typically Singapore.

Some of them were undergoing repairs as we passed through, and hopefully the updates will add even more to the area. A few bars, restaurants and other commercial establishments in the old houses and a car park. We went during the day time so the area was not busy.

An interesting glimpse into Singapore's history right in the middle of the main shopping district. Very interesting especially for those who enjoy history and architecture, and highly recommended.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-31 16:21:27.086196

With so much of Singapore being high rise and with some quite stunning architecture it came as a complete surprise that here was a remnant of the old colonial days.

The properties in Emerald Hill Road date from the early 20th century and are now preserved - or at least the outside is. Inside owners are allowed to do what they like so long as the frontage remains the same. If you are lucky, or cheeky (or both) you may be able to peep inside some of them and be amazed at what has been done to them. I spoke to some owners and it seems that some are privately owned while a good many are owned by wealthy individuals or property companies and are rented out.

In a city of modernity this street is a photographer's delight. Do make a point of going there - it is so close to the hotels and shopping malls of Orchard Road yet it is a very quiet neighbourhood as so few people actually discover it.",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 16:21:44.999179

Ultimately, as many old Singaporean streets still exist (although Emerald Hill is one of, if not the, best-preserved one/s), Emerald Hill probably isn't worth traveling far (if that's even possible in Singapore) to see. Instead, it's better as a quick stop off Orchard Road.
