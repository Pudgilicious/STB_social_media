I landed in Singapore with only a short list of places I wanted to visit, but no detailed plan or itinerary. I walked up to the Singapore Visitor Centre expecting some help with my planning process. I met Florence who listened with patience and then helped me structure an itinerary.

The best inputs I received were quick answers to questions such as:

1. ""How much time will it take us to visit this venue at ease?""
2. ""What if we skip through some of the attractions at this venue?""
3. ""What modes of transport do you recommend?""
4. ""How will a Singapore Tourist Pass help?""
5. ""If we have only 4 hours to spare on this day, which attractions do you recommend us to visit?""
6. ""Do you recommend buying the 4-park ticket or 2-park ticket?""
7. ""Should we buy cable car + attractions combo tickets, or buy separate cable car tickets?""

I benefited by pointed answers to the above questions and several more that I asked. Your mileage may vary depending upon your preparedness and prior trip research.",11-2018,Family,2020-01-31 17:10:00.725538

Was disappointed with the lack of material to read or to collect. There was more information located in the lobby of my hotel. I'm sure the staff and the computers would have been very helpful but I just wanted to gather some reading material to take away to read at my own pace and decide what to do and not to be held up there for a while searching on computers with staff and then feeling obligated to purchase tours or entrance tickets on the spot. Leaflets have handy information on them such as opening times, locality maps and how to get there directions and are extremely useful to have inside your travel bag. There was a tiny gift area at the back of the room up a couple of steps that was not worth the effort. Wouldn't waste. time going there again unless I knew that there was a large amount of information readily available to me to look over and take away.

They have brilliant touch screens showing places to visit. You can touch on them to view all the information you could need, address, opening hours, costs, directions, buses and trains etc. What was the absolute most useful thing however was that you could tell it to add it to an itinerary and then print it out at the end. This was massively useful. We found interesting things to see that we didn't know existed such as Baba House.

I would recommend looking through the touch screens yourself, once you have decided on things that interest you, you may wish to ask the Staff to help place them into an itinerary as they had the knowledge and ability to quickly and easily bunch things together by location, so that you really had a streamlined personal itinerary with all the information you could need. They were really helpful in this regard and wanted to share their knowledge with you.

Do yourself a favour and wander in here, you will be really pleasantly surprised at the usefulness and easy to use nature of these screens. In fact I wish Trip Advisor had this ability as it was so helpful.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:11:31.596576

In the Gardens by the bay go all the way to the Marina Barrage. You will find a beautiful sunset with a super nice Skylineview for free. For food try Dublin/Killiney Rd. There is a very small food court at the corner serving buffet for low prices and good coffee for 1.6S$. At Cheers Supermarket we found a good offer for a cheap beer. Grab one and enjoy the Marina View sitting at the Esplanade Theatre. Almost every night you might join a cool Band playing nice songs. For free. Same as the waterfountains jumping up and down in different colors in front of the Hotel Sands by the bay. Shows at 7p.m. and 8p.m. Or just do the riverwalk....impressive views! Also the Artscience Museum at the Marina offers free things to see. Just check it out.

She did this in a lively and illustrative way, didn't care about the lae hour and was only satisfied when we were. That was a great and very sympathetic experience.
She also told us that we could try typical local coffee specialties with local sandwiches for free the next morning, so we came back the next day and were served by a very friendly team who explained us the local ways of preparing coffee and why it is called 'kopi'. So we had a good start into another morning of visiting beautiful Singapore.

The staff is very helpful and patient. I was welcomed by Mrs. Guat Cheng and she helped me to organize my whole trip of 6 days in Singapore. I didn´t do much research before I travelled to Singapore about the things to visit. I was extremely satisfied with the service in this information center. They have a digital service where you can browse all attractions and things to do in Singapore and just click in ""add to itinerary"" if you are interested. When you are done, the staff helps you to organize the things you are interested to do/see depending on how many days you will stay there. Their advice is valuable. Then, they print out your itinerary and the information of each thing you are interested in (such as opening times, prices, how to get there, etc). All this took less than 20 minutes. It would have taken me 3 to 4 days of internet research. Of course, they also provide information about the best way to move around Singapore.
In my opinion, the system they use is the one of the best ways to get help to organize holidays. It is systematic and very well designed.

This is not the Louvre. Nor is it of any interest to a local. You might go here if you were a lost tourist in the area and didn't have the internet.

The team assured me that they always have something going on here - indeed, on my visit there were lame cardboard models of all your favourite local landmarks, pushed to the side of the room. I take this with a grain of sand though - it is their job to hype SG.

We were also thinking of some last-minute places to go before my friend leaves tomorrow. I guess the visitor experiences wanes with opening hours.

The selection of brochures is relatively limited; as with the assortment of souvenirs available. Do note that the souvenirs here are marked up from their original retail price.

We were then approached by this staff member, who came up to strike a conversation with us. The conversation started off friendly. Instead of introducing us to more places to go in Singapore, she began to talk about her own wonderful adventures in China and Hong Kong - and how much she loved being there. It felt awkwardly strange how the topic never came back to Singapore and what are some suggested places we can head to before the evening flight back. The whole experience felt to me like she just wanted to brag to us how much she knew about China and Hong Kong. We totally preferred if she could introduce to us places in Singapore that perhaps even the locals would have missed out on. The experience was distasteful, and we dropped the idea of getting our souvenirs there.

For brochures, visitors can go to various places to get them. The airport is the safest bet - I usually collect them for my overseas friends there. The museums in Singapore have way more selection too - both the National Gallery and the Asian Civilisations Museum are recommended. The National Museum of Singapore runs out of brochures very quickly.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-31 17:18:15.282999
