Better to combine trip with St John's Island,"Went to St John's Island and Kusu island together on a weekday. Take the North-South line to the end and follow the exit to Marina South Pier. Tickets (round trip) is at $18/adult and $12/children(<12). Weekday only 2 ferry so take the 10am to St John and spend a few hours there and then take the 2.45pm ferry to Kusu. The final ferry from Kusu is 4.00pm (same ferry as it will just wait there). Should reach Marina South Pier at 4.30pm.
Weekends got more ferry trips and timing is much different.
Nothing much to do on Kusu island except visit the temple and the climb up the 152 steps to the Karamet. Good to combine the trip with St John's Island.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-31 17:25:48.019222

Things you can do there are very limited to picnics, photography and praying etc. It is a very nice place for people who wants a scenery to paint or a picture to take. There is a small stall for drinks but I am unsure about food although there is a food centre there, I'm not very sure is it open or not.

To get to the island you'll have to take a ferry to st john island first (from marina south pier, which I would suggest go by MRT instead of car because 1. it's pricey - SGD13 for 4 hours. 2. the carpark is so small you might not be able to enter as the barriers don't open until a lot opens up and there isn't any other carparks in sight..) which is about 40 plus minutes and then people would board which they would then it will move off to Kusu Island in about 20 minutes or so.

The ride back to mainland from Kusu also takes about 20 minutes.

For the timetable of departures, check out their website. When I went on a Sunday, Last departure was 3pm.",06-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:25:48.418752

It is SGD$18 per person. You stop at St John's Island first, but I prefer Kusu. Kusu is very small, with a wonderful set of clean beaches and water. We did not have any sandflies. We went to the beach on same side as the dock. Water was clear, crisp and wonderful for a swim. We stayed only an hour but the BBQ pit looked inviting. We could have extended to 4 PM easily for departure if we BBQ'ed. A great perspective on Singapore from the ferry and the island.",04-2016,Family,2020-01-31 17:25:48.785234

we went to the Chinese temple with a wishing well and holy shrines of Malay saints after climbing 152 steps. be careful on your way up to the shrines as the monkeys around might snatch your belongings.

if you are lucky, you might be able to see a cute ""caretaker"", a corgi known as Ginger. the dog belongs to the caretaker and her daughter. they are very friendly and nice people. we played with their dog while waiting for our ferry.

it's a relaxed place to get away from the city if you have not visited the island. do remember to fill up your stomach before you go to the island or bring your own food and water as there is no food or drinks stall there.",04-2019,Friends,2020-01-31 17:27:24.602503

We can only visit the Chinese temple which is very beautiful. We are allowed to take photos. No modest dressing was required. Food ( limited items)and toilets available in the temple. But this was a saviour, because we had to wait for 2 hours for the next ferry. Free water is available. The beach surrounding the island is very beautiful. Swimming is not allowed. We saw small tortoises too. We had to take Singapore island cruise ferry right outside the Marina South pier MRT station to reach the island.

,1,81,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ah tee s,565528489,10-03-2018,4,Serene and pristine,"I was in Police Coast Guard between 1980 and 1987 and every year during October pilgrimage period, I will be deployed together with other officers for crowd control duty on the island. After I left Police Coast Guard, I did not make any further trip to the island until last Thursday when our Welfare organized an island hopping cruise to visit this island again.

As I walked down the lane leading to the Chinese Temple, a nostalgic memory flashed across my mind. 30 years ago, I was that smart looking, energetic and youthful officer standing on guard at this spot of the island directing the human traffic flow.

Today, I am just alone in plain attire walking down this memory lane looking at the same old Tua Pek Kong temple across the little pond. As I looked down at the reflection in the pond, I saw a man with a wrinkled face and bunch of white hair overgrown above his forehead.

Time flies but this Kusu Island seem the same Kusu island that I knew 30 years ago. The bold red and green roof temple building contrasted starkly with the surrounding, the Tortoise sanctuary, the keramat temple at the hill top, the long stretch of sandy beach and the many coconut and palm trees that wavered in the wind.

My colleagues went into the temple compound to pray to the two deities, the Tua Pek Gong and the Goddess of Mercy. The praying hall has not changed much and the sculpture of two tortoises still remained standing at the compound. The label on the sculpture showed that it was erected in 1976.

We walked up the stairs to the keramat Datuk Nenek temple at the hill-top. Despite having some back pain, I still managed to surmount the climb. The yellow painted praying area remained the same that I saw 30 years back and is still very well maintained.

From the keramat, we walked down to the beach. The area was full of trees and probably filled with positive ions. It is a healthy getaway for a half a day island hopping cruise to this island. No pollution from passing vehicles, no heavy traffic, no car horns, no noise pollution but just the rhyme of the splashing sea waves and the soothing wind that caressed my face. It was rejuvenating and a refreshing nostalgic outing. The atmosphere was serene and the scenery pristine.

We spent about an hour here but it was enough to refresh all my old memories. As the ferries departed from the jetty, I wondered when will I come again to this island that is far from the madding crowd.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-31 17:27:25.837095

To get Kusu Island you just take the MRT to to the Marina South Pier Station, than buy the ticket, it's about 18$ and you can visit St. John Island and Kusu Island. Make a plan if you want to visit both islands, because there's scheduled ferry. It's different schedule between weekdays and weekend.

When you have arrive at Kusu Island you can find calm situation here. Many trees, waves and water sounds will make you streesless, i think hehehe... Oh ya, there's no food or drink stall here, you must bring it from Singapore.

Just enjoy your time, with take many pictures here, play at the beach, pray, or maybe make a wish, by throw some coins into the centre of the pond.

I should say that this island is not a place of fun. It is more a historical location. It have a fusion of Chinese, Malay and Hindu culture. There are two temples on the island. Both walkable distance.

No one seems to know about the origin of this festival but it has been going all the world. During this period, there will be crowds going to the island, many devotees as well as curious tourists and visitors.

For the locals who visit the Chinese temple during this period, most of them would climb up the stairs to the Kramat a short distance away to pay respects. They were said to be two islands in the old days (you can see photos in the Chinese temple how the devotees took sampan - small boats - across to the Kramat. During those days, the Chinese devotees would go vegetarian and abstain from pork as a sign of respect.

The Chinese temple and kramat show the interactions of the multi-racial and cultures in Singapore through their history right to this day.

Since the past 20 years or more, a local Nanyin (meaning Southern Sounds or Music in Chinese) group would visit this temple on a Saturday evening during the Tua Pek Kong festival to perform in the temple. It was like a time that stood still as the ancient music and songs vibrated out of this temple in this tiny island.",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:27:27.784201

The name Kusu means ""Tortoise"" or ""Turtle"" in Chinese; the island is also known as Peak Island or Pulau Tembakul in Malay. From two tiny outcrops on a reef, this island was enlarged and transformed into an island holiday resort of 85,000 square metres today.

The fact that these constructions made the island usable (you at least can buy water - even if overpriced - and there are shower facilities for swimmers) is nice as long as it's not turned into a smaller version of the over-commercialized Sentosa. The few beaches are nice and do feel cozy and peaceful, even if you just want to relax in the shade and enjoy the fantastic ocean breeze on a hot sunny day. Is it worth $18? Not for me if it's Kusu alone. But a beach lover could enjoy some swimming at Lazarus (beware of the floating trash!), and then continue and finish at Kusu for the shower facilities.

Overall, I think it's definitely worth a trip for a first time (experiencing St. John's, Lazarus, and Kusu), but you'll need to judge for yourself for later visits.",05-2016,Friends,2020-01-31 17:27:34.504571

There is no eating places on the island so we bought food from the shops at Marina South Pier.

We had plenty of time to spare before the first ferry left at 10am. So we went to the Maritime Gallery which is free to get in.

The ferry ride take 30 minutes to get to St. John's Island.

We choose to stay on the ferry to the next island which is Kusu Island. This only took another 15 minutes to get there. The ferry stays here for an hour which is plenty of time to visit this beautiful island. Other wise the next ferry is not till 4pm.
