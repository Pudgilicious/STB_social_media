This shopping mall built in 1990s and that time got a serious construction tragedy occurs during construct the shopping mall. I still vividly remember there were casualties and reported on local news paper too.

Few years ago this shopping mall go through renovation again and business start to pick up . New shop enter the mall such as coffee bean , daiso , Thye Moh Chan 泰茂栈 ( famous Teochew traditional baking) , NTUC , Singapore MINT , dessert shop etc . There is a library located at level 4.

If you want to eat fast food and it is available such as MacDonald ( located around the taxi stand) and KFC ( located behind lottery shop) .

There are a lot of elderly seat around there and enjoy their afternoon.
This place very crowd especially during Chinese new year and Chinese festival .

Nursing room / diaper room.
It is very horrible and only one room available. Located at level 3.
There are no sign indicated that the room is occupy.
The water tap is faulty and basin sink is flooded. Do note there are no paper allocated hence parent need prepare for it. There is a small chair for breast feeding and room space is spacious (can stand two adult).

Conclusion:
Every 6mths we do visit the place and shop around the area. I do hope that mall management need to improve and maintain their facilities",09-2018,Family,2020-01-31 17:41:52.400775

One of the higher floors was dedicated to 'Travel & holiday' Cruises looked a speciality, not much interest as a tourist for us, but I did notice lack of the bargain of the year at this moment in time, no trips to the UK advertised, as the pound value has fallen NOW is the time to change local currency (well, most currencies actually) into GBP & get over to the UK while things are great value.

There are few ways to come here, which can be confusing for those unfamiliar. One is via the few exits of Chinatown MRT station, which is confusing.

But there is another side to it- a standalone mid-size modern shopping mall right in the heart of Chinatown ie Chinatown Point Mall. There are 2 other much older & smaller malls nearby but they are not the same.

You can find almost anything essential to everyday needs here, as with other modern malls in Orchard & Marina.

Amazingly for a mid-sized mall like this, there are certainly alot of mid range international & local dining options. Local, Korean, HK, Japanese, Chinese, Western, etc. Quite a number of them are good. Some famous ones too.

There are a number of reasons to visit Chinatown Point when in Chinatown.

1. Good, mid priced & very wide choices of local & international food, spread all over the 4 floors.

2. After a hot humid walk along the streets, there is no better place in Chinatown than here- to relax & cool down in this nice mall.

3. Unlike Orchard & Marina areas, one can easily find clean & nice toilets in any of the malls. Not here. The only place where one can find decent clean toilets is here. However go to to the upper floors ones. It is less utilised, less crowded & much cleaner.

4. There are many interesting shops here. Some are new, did not see them in last visit. However there are 2 very big ones to visit.

Daiso Japan general store. Thousands of item at $2 each. Located in B2, behind Han's Cafe.

NTUC Fairprice price supermarket. A mid size supermart to get your drinks,etc at cheap prices. Located on B1.

It's got the main retail stores like Uniqlo, Daiso, a large supermarket and a pretty good food court downstairs covering many cuisines. You can easily get lost and bewildered by all the commotion but just take a deep breath and leisurely explore the floors. The taxi drops you right at the front door where there's a dedicated lane for them to pull in.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-31 17:43:59.383529

Tonight we choose the Soon Huat Dining Room on 2F for a pleasant meal, we choose BKT soup with mushrooms and Tow Kee plus bean sprouts with garlic, plus a braised mix platter, rice and cool drinks.

The meal was quite good.

Afterwards we wandered amongst the retail shops on different levels...Chinatown Point Mall was quite busy for a Friday night.

Recommended for a meal or for a shopping feast...tis your choice.",05-2017,Friends,2020-01-31 17:44:00.139389
