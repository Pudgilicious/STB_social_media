It is adult$35 for return. Under 12 y.o is $25

So make a most of it.

I would highly recommend to buy online, and if u are planning to go to some attractions in Sentosa island, there r always very reasonable plan for adding cable car fee.

Mount Faber peak has a great view and it was only around $10 from /to Liang court / Clark keys by GRAB.

It was a bit confusing to go to universal studio from Mt Faber peak.

I thought we could directly go there but actually had to change the cable car and also had to ride an express train( MONO Rail).",01-2020,Family,2020-01-31 17:44:32.840290

The naturally ventilated cable cars were something great & unexpected in a place like Singapore where everything is airconditioned.

It's a small place with some interesting things. You get out of cable car and exit from middle of a shop (that's the case at many places).

Mainly it's about Bells of Happiness, Restaurent and Merlion (not Merlion Park one). We visited during a rainy day and the weather was awesome. We sat in the open area and enjoyed our meal. It was really nice. (Be careful about slippery floor).

The bar is very good, as are the staff. We had a few drinks here, the Singapore Slings made here were one of the best whilst in Singapore.
We enjoyed it here so much that we came back on another evening and the staff remembered us which was nice.

It is also included in every group tour of Singapore, which means that it is almost impossible to get a good photo without someone encroaching on the shot. Tour groups start arriving before 8am on most days so if you want the place to yourself, go early. The upside is that the tour groups never go on any of the walk trails around including the steep climb from Henderson road, so plenty of room to enjoy nature at its best.

Naturally the entrance and exit for the cable-way was via the gift shop. There was a queue but it wasn't too long. The sign said that the capacity of each car was eight people but they gave us a car all to ourselves (except for a staff member who was probably finishing her shift and going home).

The cable car goes high up over the harbour giving great views of Singapore and Sentosa Island. There is an intermediate station but we continued to the final destination at Faber Peak.

It is among one of the best things to do there. Yes, people do go there for the purpose of doing the cable car ride to Sentosa but Faber Peak in itself is so nice !

The walk up to Faber Peak from Mt. Faber Park is exhilarating. A word of caution here though that dont walk to Mt. Faber and better to take a cab if you are old or with children. I am pretty fat but I was glad I made the walk although I was sweating profusely once we reached the top.

Once you are at Faber Peak, do visit the toilets which have an amazing view of the CIty. Also, they have this Bell of Happiness where you can pose and it has some amazing views. What we liked though was the boundary bridge where bells were tied and you can purchase bells from the gift shop (2 for SGD 10) and write your wish on it and tie it. Since the Paris lovelock birdge closed down, this felt nice. The bells too are light so I dont foresee any problems there.

According to Google Map, it is not that far. However, the road suggested by Google Map is closed, and it is not walking distance. I think we had better take a taxi to Faber Peak or take a cable car at Harbour Front Station.

The view from the cable car is very nice though.

Don't worry you don't need to walk back just follow the signs to Alexandra Rd and from there it's only a short walk ( 800m) to Labrador MRT station.
