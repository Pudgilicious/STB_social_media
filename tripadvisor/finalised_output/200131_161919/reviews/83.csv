,1,83,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/CheongGerald,647279548,21-01-2019,1,Bad Experience with a CIty Square Mall Tenant,"City Square Mall is a pretty good mall for people living or staying around the area as it is comprehensive, comprising many amenities and shops to cater to everyone's needs. There are some big retail shops there (e.g. Donki Donki, Decathlon, just to name a few) and hence, it is often crowded. In my view, is a good mall to hangout, go for food or get your daily necessities. It is also conveniently located right at a MRT, making it easily accessible.

When I was there yesterday, my son and I went into the Play E store at #B2-44 of the mall. It is a store that sells toys and computer merchandises catered mainly to children and teenagers. In short, the service and attitude of the salesperson was so bad that it left a sour taste in my mouth. We wanted to purchase some items (which my son liked very much) from the shop (the items were on display with price tags clearly shown) and he refused to sell to us without any reason. I tried to reason but he could only answer ""there is no reason, I just don't want to sell to you"". We left with my son feeling affected and sad.

While this rather substandard and disgraceful service may just be an one-off incident and may not be reflective of the service quality of the rest of the Play E outlets, the tenants in City Square Mall or Singapore, the Management of City Square Mall and Play E should really look into the operations of this particular outlet. We do not want to have tourists experiencing such poor service and leave with a bad note on our service quality; and our young children being helplessly turned away with disappointment

It only takes one bad experience to ruin the whole day.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-31 17:33:30.487868

But...
I went to the supermarket downstairs and everyone was having their purchases put into single use plastic bags that the supermarket provided! Then I went to the fruit section hoping to buy a few pieces of fruit for the two of us for next morning's breakfast. This was not possible as fruit such as apples and kiwis were boxed up in plastic trays of six, then further wrapped in clear plastic.

From Singapore, we took the MRT to Woodlands, in which we transferred to bus interchange to take bus 913, to the Woodlands Train Checkpoint which is located beside the Woodlands Checkpoint. There are also other bus services at the bus interchange such as 950, 856, 903, 911, and 912 which would bring you to the Checkpoint or near the Checkpoint. It is highly recommended to take this route as taking the bus services (bus services 160 and 170 at opposite Kranji MRT) of usual route are usually very packed and having difficulty getting onboard.

At bus stop beside Woodlands Train Checkpoint, we proceed to the taxi stand, then we took the escalator up then walked the one-way route (go with the crowd) to the Woodlands Checkpoint. After had our passport checked, we proceed to take Malaysia's CW bus service, through there are alternative Singapore bus services such as 170 and 160. Each CW ticket cost 1.50 RM or 1 SGD. We paid cash upon on boarding the bus and the driver provided receipts to each of us. The bus travelled across the Woodlands causeway and to Johor Bahru's Checkpoint. After walked out off the Checkpoint having our passport checked, we acrossed the overhead bridge to opposite to City Square Mall.

Beside the City Square Mall there is another mall, Komtar JBCC. This mall is known for having a Angry Bird Activity Park inside. It is a very big, new, modern mall. There are restaurants such a Fish Manhattan, Tony Roman, Dragon-i, Pizza Hut and others. There are also departmental stores (MetroJaya), pharmacy (The Caring pharmacy), clothing store (F.O.S) and others.

After a short visit to Komtar JBCC, we walked over to City Square Mall. City Square Mall is a modern mall that has shops that ranges from Fashion, Food and Beverages, Beauty and Wellness, Electonics, Gifts, Toys and Books, and even Entertainment such as a Cinema which located at levels 5, 6 and 7.

Comparing with my previous visit at 2015, there are several new interesting shops such as, DC Super Heroes Cafe (Level 2), Super Heroes (Level 2), Din Tai Fung (Level 2), and Original Cake (Level 3). Do try dining at Din Tai Fung, which provides reasonable prices (when compare with Singapore outlets), good services and good ambience which way better than Canton-i. One of the top favourites is the Pork Dumpling which has soup oozing out of the dumpling. Beside Din Tai Fung is the DC Super Heroes Cafe, which provides affordable prices on coffee and cakes. The ambience is great and you feel that you are seated in the DC Comic World with Batman, Wonder Woman and others. As for Original Cakes, their cakes is something worth waiting for as their Castella cake is famous in Taiwan, and shop closes once cakes are sold out. Other than the new shops in the mall, do check out other shops like Canton-i, Seasons, H&M, Yong Sheng Gift Shop, Action City, Cotton On, Red Eye, Uniqlo, Famous Amos and others.

As Mid-Autumn festival is coming, the mall has organised Mid-Autumn festival fair where different vendors are selling Mooncakes at the level 1. You will be able to sample different variety of Mooncakes and be in the Mid-Autumn festival mood. Do try the less sugar Mooncakes as it is trendy and better for health.

Even if it wasn't Mid-Autumn festival, shoppers are usually there for cheaper things due to the exchange rate, such as, restaurant food, Malaysia local products and branded products. However, take note of some of their restrooms which may not too up to standard. You may encountered issues, such as insufficient cubicles, wet floor, lack of toilet paper, and no hand soap. Despite the high human traffic at the checkpoint, you would not regret as their quality product are cheaper. To Singaporeans, it is like a ""mini affordable getaway"".

From my previous experiences of avoiding high volume human traffic, avoid weekends and long weekends. I usually go during weekdays. As the mall opening hours is around 11am, I am at the checkpoint around 10 plus. I usually leave the mall at 4pm to avoid high volume human traffic.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-31 17:33:55.433622

The famous ""roggeng"" dancers from neighbouring countries use to woo men here for a dance under the watchful eyes of the bouncers. This old amusement park use to house State Theatre in the early days for English, Hindi, Malay and other movies. One entrance was from the junction of Kitchener Road and Serangoon Road and the other entrance is from Jalan Besar. This mall closed down in the late April 1987 but it amused the locals and tourist from 1920s. It was the home to striptease queen Rose Chan, wrestler King Kong, strongman MatTarzan without his Jane and boxer Felix Boy.

In World War 2 the Japanese named this place Shin Segal and turned this into a gambling den for the civilians to congregate but not for the Japanese soldiers. This was a place for black market selling our daily neccessities and exhorbitant prices.

The only thing that is left of New World is the gateway at the junction of Kitchener Road and Serangoon Road leading to City Square Mall.

The shopping in City Square Mall is pleanty to tickle your interest and restaurants, food kiosk and food court to drool your taste buds.

I have been to several malls in Singapore but this is my first time I visited this mall. I took the purple line from Outram Park and alighted at Farrer Park station. Once you came out from the MRT station and walked for a short distance and you are in the mall itself. It is located at the junction of Serangoon Road and Kitchener Road

The mall is lustrously modern, clean, big and convenient. The charges for the basement parking is quite reasonable. I came at 6.30 pm and departed at 10.30 pm and the car park charge is a flat rate of $3/-. Weekday parking is free if you spent $60/- at the mall subject to some terms and conditions.

There is a Food Republic located at the 4th floor at reasonable price with nice design. also visited two Chinese medical halls and bought some herbal stuff. The spacious and well designed NTUC Fair price supermarket at Basement 1 seem to attract the most customers. The wide range of fast food outlets like Pizza Hut, Macdonald, KFC, Subway, etc gave customers more choices and options.

The mall is the first eco-mall but I am no expert to distinguish the difference between this mall and the rest of the neighborhood malls. I understand there are a number of installations and designs in the architectural make-up of the mall that reduce energy consumption.

At the customer service counter, there are some signs on donate your excess food and disposal of irreparable electrical appliances. Seem a bit different in their operations.
