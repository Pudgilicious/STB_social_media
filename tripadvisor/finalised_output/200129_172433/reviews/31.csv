There are restaurants and bars to lighten your wallet/purse and - if you are so inclined- those vertiginous swim-up bars with that infinity feel.

But that is it, it does not seem to be integrated as part of the city. I guess you could say something similar of most bridges (with the exception of Ponte vecchio in Florence) but this bridge is just a lookout to other things in the city more than a functional or marvel of engineering.

The bridge is very interesting to photograph though. If you want to capture the DNA helix with its colours as reflected off the bridge, I will suggest to you to come early in the morning, when there is not much traffic and go nuts. That is what we did... unfortunately, there is nothing to eat around, so you will have to walk to the shopping mall or wait several ours after the sun has come up to get something decent to eat.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 05:58:20.609104

Helix bridge has several ""look outs"" which provide great photo opportunities of the down town business district, the theaters by the bay and even another aspect to Marina Bay Sands.

I walked from one end of the bridge to the other end while recording the ceiling in that mode. Surprisingly, I could see the beauty of those helixes from other perspective.

Grab a position over the gardens before 7.30 and watch the Garden Rhapsody light show that starts at 0745. As soon as that finishes you can gallop to the other end of the bridge to catch Spectra - a laser, light and water show on the bay. I think the show is better from the ground floor but if you prefer less crowds stay on the same level and swing right before the escalators and elevators and you will be able to watch from slightly obstructed platforms.

This is a very interesting bridge. Coming from the Ritz Carlton Hotel to the Art Science Museum, over the bridge was the obvious choice. Nice to look at, but don't linger as its so hot. Took some nice photos of the bridge, and breathed a sigh of relief when I reach the air conditioning of the museum.

Its a beautiful and interesting bridge. Singapore can be well proud of its architecture, with old and modern side by side. Nice views of MBS and Marina Bay.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 06:09:56.055343

o Amazing design by the architect. Be blown away by the beauty of this helix bridge. Look at how thick the weld is! Wow!
ii. It is helix shape, I call it Singapore-DNA. Sleek, modern, strength in beauty, simple yet marvelous.
o Beautiful and strategic bridge in the Bay Area where one can enjoy the architecture skyline of the metropolitan.
o Wide and able to fit many. You don't feel clustered at all.
o There are small ""bubble""- sections for photographic purposes. Very well thought of!
o It connects to MBS shopping centre.
x Although quite wide, I would love to have some benches so one can sit and enjoy the view.",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 06:09:57.102619
