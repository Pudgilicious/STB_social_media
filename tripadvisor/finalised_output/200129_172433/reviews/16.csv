The city can wear you down a little bit with the pace and the crowds, but this park - even on a weekend with nice weather offers trails that are fairly peaceful. The treetop walk is the highlight and worth the 6 km round trip, but that trail can be crowded on the weekends. The long loop around the lake and golf course is never very crowded. Although there are runners that pass by, they usually don't make much noise so you can actually hear the forest. Do watch out for the macaques, they like to steal food if they see an opportunity.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 23:42:40.342823

I am surprised not many people coming at all. We only saw around 10 to 20 people during our 5 hours trailing. The canopy tree top was amazing. It was really high and long (250 to 350 meters I think).

It offers a walk by the reservior : leasurely & easier than the one through tropical forest : Tree top trail. The signage is adequate and explains degree of difficulty so that you cam choose as per your fitness standards. Carry water. Snack optional. As advised stick to the trail.

,1,16,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Oliver S,680637646,11-06-2019,4,Nice to be outdoors!!,"A nice place to go to escape the concrete jungle. Essentially the nature trail is a walk around the reservoir - its about 10km (without the treetop walk) and 12km with it. I went with my 3 children and it took about 3 1/2 hours to do the 12km loop. For most of the way, its a ""jungle path"" which is OK when its dry, but not when its raining as it gets very slippery. The walk itself is not ""easy easy"" - there are plenty of hills and long windy paths plus if you want to do the Tree Top Walk, its a fair walk up a steep hill and then down lots of lots of stairs the other side. Because you are walking through forest, the views are not always spectacular however every so often the trail opens up and you get a decent view across the reservoir. Plus if you do the Tree Top Walk, you get a great view (looking north!). There is plenty of wildlife to see - including monkeys and snakes, plus at the end there is a little restaurant that serves drinks, hot & cold food and there are even showers there if you want to freshen up! The trail walk can get very busy with other walkers and runners, however for a few hours in the outdoors, it is well worth it. FYI, it is for walking only - no bikes allowed!!",06-2019,Family,2020-01-29 23:42:42.394338

We did the easiest walk, which was about 1.2km, which was 600 into the forested hiking path (it was spacious and not narrow), and on the return leg, we crossed to the Lakeside Boardward, to walk alongside the Reservoir.
We also met with a family of Monkeys (Maccacs) at the Start of the Trail and took make close up Photos. Luckily these monkeys were young and were not disturbing us.
At the end of the walk, there is a complete Food and Drink Stall and sitting area under the shelter, with reasonable prices for Pastas and other dinner and lunch foods. There are also good shower and lockers and bathroom facilities at this area. We had a Good Car Parking area too, so it was so convenient for city dwellers to make a first attempt at the nature reserve. And oh yes, the views of the large Reservoir was a sight to behold for selfies and photo taking.

We did not see many wild life on the way apart from monkeys until we were wallking along the reservoir and saw a lizard swimming and little lizards basking. Probably Sunday morning is a peak time as it is the weekend and early is cooler. It is a great walk for variety and a jungle 'feel'. There are ranger stations to fill up with water and good toilets.

MacRitchie Nature Trails are natural trails, so wear comfortable shoes. First stop is tree top walk - maybe not the most impressive, but still excellent views on tropical trees from top.

There is ranger station - do not miss, as this is the only place where you can refill bottles of water and if temperature is plus 35 and humid then water will be needed. Inside trails you will see many monkeys, many baby monkeys and most likely also some angry monkeys (not so nice so be prepared and on watch all the time). We saw also some bigger animal running away- not sure if that was deer on big pig but something heavy and scary.

After tree top walk you can follow trail through trees or near golf course along lake - we enjoyed later as there was air breezes and was not so humid any more as inside forest. And there were different animals like big lizards (we saw around 2 meters long) and one lizard followed as for long distance in water (i guess people are feeding them).

Don't forget to carry a bottle of water and apply anti mosquito cream in case you have sensitive skin. You go on a hiking trail for approximately 18-20 km back and forth. You start with a path which is sandwiched between a golf course and the reservoir. The view is magnificently misty early in the morning when the sun just peaks from far away.

It is well worth the effort to make the loop starting from either the Venus Carpark or the MacRitchie trail head.

The total trail including the treetops walk (which is equally worth the hike) is around 12kms so allow yourselves 3-4 hours to take it at a leisurely pace stopping along the way. The trails are well marked and it is pretty much impossible to get lost.

On the walk you will likely see wild monkeys, monitor lizards and if lucky some of the local (not venomous and not so venomous) whip snakes and other varietals.

It is hot and humid and up and down but nothing is particularly difficult. Be warned however on the ranger station has a water fountain and that is 3.5kms into the walk. So.....bring a large bottle of water. The other thing is that whilst a lot of the trail is boardwalk, unfortunately there are a lot of steps and rough terrain making (I would imagine) impossible for the physically impaired.

The best bits - it is an escape from the hustle and bustle of the CBD and City life; the wildlife is excellent and interesting.....and it is free.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-29 23:42:58.402158

Ocversea Visitors should note that it is normally impossible to get a taxi at Lornie Road. I met a group of three man who were hailing for taxis. They wanted to take a bus but none had cash they carried only credit cards. Make sure that you have change to take the bus or pre-paid card to take a bus or the phone numbers of taxi services like Grab.
The hike was interesting and some places beautiful. Not fantastic on a rainy or hot and sunny day. Do bring water and get yourself hydrated, there are no stalls except for one station that water could be purchased. Have a walking stick, could be useful if attacked by monkeys as they can be aggressive especially if you are carrying food.

A google search for the entrance to the treetop walk took us to the lower carpark. Until we arrived I didn't realise this was just the entry to the park. The tree top walk was a further 4km up the hill.

There is plenty of signage, but it is terribly inaccurate. For example, we passed a sign that said ""treetop walk 1200m"" then a few minutes later a sign that said ""treetop walk 1500m"". From the carpark it is supposedly a 6km round trip. My GPS recorded 9.8km total and we never left the marked trails.

Hold onto backpacks and don't consume food near the treetop walk or ranger station as this is where most of the monkeys hang out ready to grab food and other items. There's no water or toilets along the track except at the ranger station so take a day pack, water and mosquito repellant.

The squirrel trail is good for children and squirrel are easy to find. There's also fish in the stream and children will enjoy feeding them bread. The view from the treetop walk was nice and the overall park is very pleasant.

,1,16,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/chew eng o,502087535,15-07-2017,5,Great hiking trail.,"Mac Richie Reservoir - Singapore

Mac Richie Reservoir is one of the oldest reservoirs in Singapore built by the British. Construction was eventually completed in 1868 but the pumps and distributing network were not finished until 1877.

The forest surrounding the reservoir has been protected as a water catchments reserve. It is the nearest open reservoir to the City which is why it is the most popular venue of visit for both locals and tourists. It is also area that receive the most rainfall.

Deep in the nature reserve there is the ruins of a shrine that was built by the Japanese Imperial Army during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore during World War 2. Visitors are told not to try to reach it, moreover it is suited away from the normal tracks that visitors frequent.

There are boardwalks skirting the edge of the scenic MacRitchie Reservoir and walking trails through the forest. The trails range in distances from 3 km to a 11 km round trip. Both the boardwalks and trails are signposted allowing visitors to venture safely on a self-guided tour.

The boardwalk and trails which hug the reservoir also allow for easy exploration of freshwater wildlife, plants and bird life. Apart from a occasional glimpse of some monkeys and squirrels other animals such as monitor lizards, snakes, samba deer, and wild boars will remain hidden from human eyes.

Most of the visitors coming in from the main entrance will head straight across the dam towards the kayak storage area. School children can be seen in the afternoons kayaking and canoeing in the calm waters. The popular Tree Top walk is in that direction. It is a 250 m aerial suspension bridge spanning the two highest points in the reservoir. At 25 m it offers a panoramic view of the surrounding rainforest. A short distance from the exit of the Tree Top Walk is the Jelutong Tower which also offers a panoramic view of the surroundings. A visitor taking a round trip will come across a golf course that come close to the edge of the trial. As the flights all head away from the trails there is no possibility of any stray balls that go out of bounds.

It should be noted that the terrain of the trials are normally of gradual gradient and the ground in most cases level. A person of normal fitness would be able to hike the 11 km round trip. However there is a 22 km (round trip) circuit that connect MacRichie with the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve starting and ending at Dairy Farm Nature Reserve car park. For that tough route you have to start at Dairy Farm and take the rough terrain behind the Bukit Timah Reserve till you come to Rifle Range Road and follow the road till you come to the entrance of the forest leading to MacRichie. For that trip I will need to bring my lunch and sufficient water and a poncho, in case it rain, and I have to start my hike before noon for a 6 hour trip. I am 74 and I have to take it slow. There is also a (more than) 30 km hike that continues from MacRicher onwards. I will write about it someday when I have the time to go through the route once more. It will take me the whole day.",04-2017,Family,2020-01-29 23:43:35.217376

There are also monitor lizards and beautiful butterfly species (I spotted 13 different species on the two hour walk). There are also birds and reptiles to keep everyone interested.

A good starting point is the Mushroom Cafe at the southeastern corner of MacRitchie Reservoir, which is easily accessible by bus or car and has toilets, showers and lockers (for small items only). Remember to fill up water bottles and bring enough food to last for the whole trail, but make sure to hide them from wild monkeys. Also apply insect repellent before starting the trail. (Spraying of repellent along the trail can affect native animals and is therefore not encouraged.)

The trail itself is relatively easy to walk, with very gentle gradients and well-marked signposts. However, the trail can be flooded and very muddy especially after a rain. Wear waterproof shoes, or be prepared for wet socks. Also be careful of passing runners who may run onto puddles and splash mud onto everyone around them. (The trail is popular with runners on weekends. Hence, to keep your feet dry, the best time to visit is on a weekday with no rain for the past 2 days.) The trail is well shaded most of the time, except for a portion where the trail skirts along the perimeter of Island Country Club, where there is no shade. There are narrow paths, staircases, and uneven grounds, so don't bring anything with wheels (e.g. prams, bicycles, wheelchairs).

There are a few rest stops to fill up your water bottle case need(highly advised to take water with you) and the trail is certainly up hill and down dale. I would say you would have to be only moderately fit to partake. I am over 60(with paunch) and managed it with no problems.

We recently discovered that we are not allowed to park up the Country Club road anymore near the water tank reservoir which used to cut a fair bit off the walk for our young kids. You now can only park at the Venus Drive entrance which is currently getting a make over so can be difficult to get a park t the peak times.
In the near future a boardwalk will be completed linking the two regions of the carpark and the access to the info centre.
I suggest that you be careful of the monkeys. Don't confront them in this area as they are very bold and sometime attack visitors on the bridge to get food from the backpacks. This happened recently to people we were walking with. Secure your glasses and food wrappers as they will go for anything including water bottles sticking out of backpacks as you walk by.

Started the trail from Venus car park, went all the way to treetop walk. After the treetop, we went to the Jelutong tower and then walked back to the Venus car park area. The total trek was around 8km and we finished it leisurely in around 3 hours. The view from suspended bridge and jelulong tower was worth all the effort. And fresh air was added advantage! Carry enough water and keep the bottle inside your bag. There is a water dispenser/ toilet at the ranger station; which is still a good walk from the venus car park. There are monkeys looking to snatch bottles/ plastic.

Check out the trails before you plan to do the trek. There are various entry points and some can be long for non-trekkers.

Venus car park can be reached by bus from Little India. The bus stop is around a km walk from the car park though. We went by taxi to keep ourselves fresh for trek,but came back by bus.

We took a cab to the reservoir and stocked up on drinks and something to eat before setting off on the 11km trail. Half way round would be the tree top walk which we were told was a must. Unfortunately, as it turned out, can honestly say it wasn´t. Massively over rated. Queues were rather long to go across the bridge as they only allow 30 on at a time, so if there is a relatively long line dont bother. Its up high but doesn´t really add much. The monkeys that are around are far more entertaining as they search for food, some being rather bold and actually taking things from peoples back packs.
Overal everythng was pleasant enough walking through the forest/jungle with the wildlife all around and the reseervoir being well looked after with plenty of fish and wildlife.
Be careful when walking or those who are mad enough to run in the humidity the ground under foot is very uneven with lots of bricks and rocks that can turn an ankle so take it easy.

This is a moderate hike considering the heat and elevation change to get to the Tree Top Walk. On the way back the kids were pretty tired so we took a short cut and called for a taxi at the golf club which shortened the hike by about 1.5km.

We saw three snakes whilst on the walk, one on the foot path and the other two were curled up in small trees approximately 0.5m from the path. Make sure you watch your children so that they don't go and touch something they probably should not.

It was opened during 1909 as a water reservoir for the city. It was improved and name changed to MacRitche upon the Municipal Engineer of Singapore during 1921. It can be expressed as the lungs of Singapore, located in the centre of the city. There are number of trails, some with wooden pathways through the primary forest. The walk through these trails is just divine and it costs nothing. At the higher reaches is the walk through the Tree Top walk and lower area is the huge lake. I saw rare snakes, dragon, huge and baby tortoises, big fishes etc. Fishing is permitted with licence. You can also do canoeing and other water sports.

Very reasonably priced, toilets & drinking water fountain/refill points as well.
Interestingly there are male & female changing rooms with showers & lockers - so you could get changed into running gear, have run then shower & change afterwards...what a great idea. I think the only cost involved is the coin required for a locker & key, which I assume you get back. Brilliant, more innovation from this fantastic country.
We walked to the Tree Top walk from there, which was very good...the actual ’tree top’ bit is only about 400m long. But it is a single span suspension footbridge, it is ONE WAY and numbers on the bridge are controlled at the entrance - if you walked all that way to ’not do it’...you would probably be a bit disappointed.
This area had plenty if Monkeys, we saw a few on the way...but they seem to gather in numbers here, that said we had no problem with them. They actually seemed quite indifferent to our presence.
The boardwalk section was also interesting - plants & wildlife etc. But has many steps, up & down - they are well maintained so no issue unless you have mobility limitations.
We turned right at the end of the boardwalk and continued our circuit of the lake, still beautiful and I think more level and easier walking than our 1st leg to the Tree Top walk entrance. In fact the last 2 - 3 km had a good deal of boardwalk around the shoreline - which was level, solid and not slippery...for our weary legs (& minds!) this was perfect. If you wish you can continue along the more natural track of course.
We did this still a bit jet lagged and adjusting to the climate (arrived from UK the afternoon before) we felt we had a good days walk....but it is only 10km, so it could be done much quicker if wished. But I advise allowing plenty of time to actually look around, amongst a host of birds & butterflies etc we saw a Colugo clinging to a tree, with ’babies’ head poking out...only about 30 m from the track and 10 m up the tree.
We made use of the Mushroom Cafe and toilets before catching the bus back to our accommodation.
Too tips -
Keep left on the tracks, especially on the sections where the numerous ’joggers’ use it.
Make sure you have plenty of water & the right footwear. There were water refill & toilet facilities at The Mushroom Cafe and the Ranger Station close to the Tree Top walk entrance.

I stopped to allow them time to move , but in typical monkey nonchalance they decided to stay there. Then they were behind us too, so we decided to slowly walk through them. Bad move. They erupted into shrill screams and pandemonium broke out. It was quite unnerving . My son was charged by one and it punched him on the leg. Not nice . They didn't continue hassling us and simply disappeared into the jungle. Its their territory and there are signs warning you about the monkeys but just be aware that encounters are not always placid and not always provoked. I would not take small children on the walk across the bridge either as they were all around the steps near to it and were attacking people for their bags and personal belongings. As we mad our way back to areas where there were more people we noticed many locals carrying large sticks with them , now we know why! Beautiful area. worth a hike. But go prepared.

The locals were out in force on the reserve doing canoeing, kayaking and skull rowing when we arrived at 0800 as were plenty of trail runners.

We did the 11km trail starting at the main shower / toilet / eating area (where the local 166 bus stop is) and cut it down to about 8 1/2 km by stopping at the Venus trail and carpark.

The views across the water are well worth the walk, the forest made for a great escape from the concrete jungle that is downtown Singapore. The only negative to the walk was the 2km spent with the lake on one side and a golf course on the other. Real shame that a bigger corridor could not of been kept. The effects of over fertilisation and the massive blooms of water grasses (being dredged when we were there) are a real shame and perfect example of why a corridor is needed between the two uses.

Overall, if you are spending more than a couple of days in Singapore and want to do something different, away from the shops and bright lights then this place and the walk is highly recommended.

The Tree Top Walk is impressive, longer than I expected, and very high up in the trees. To get to the start from the Rangers Station is a 300m steep road and at the end you go down and up and down quite a lot of stairs so it will require a level of fitness.

Don't misunderstand me, this park is beautiful (as I will describe further down), I am just warning you that Singapore isn't precisely the most harmonic place with nature as it has been heavily built to accommodate its residents.

Nevertheless, you can come to this park via bus or train and the entrance has some clear signs telling you when you are getting into monkey territory (asking you not to feed the animals).

If you have never been to a nature reserve I should tell you, bring water, comfortable shoes and, in case you want to do the full walk, something to eat. Is impressive how many residents come here just to exercise and have a chat. Going up is not super demanding, there is footpath almost all the way and you might have a treat or two when monkeys, chipmunks, lizards and various birds pop out the vegetation to give you a little private show before disappearing into the vegetation once more.

The trek is relatively easy, you will see a lot of elderly people going by you having a chat and trying to get their workout on their way... That being said, if you are unfit or you have mobility issues I will highly recommend you to take the trek with a complete attitude of ""I will chill out and I don't need to do everything"". I say this because, Singapore is quite warm, meaning you will be sweating and overheating easily, meaning if you are not careful you can dehydrate yourself and pass out.

As several other people have mentioned here, bring comfortable footwear and lots of water. We didn't need a bug spray but the part we underestimated was how much water we were going to consume and by the end of the trek we had our mouth completely dry and were looking for a convenience store or a shop of sorts to get water.

The full trek can be 10 kilometres (or a bit more). It really depends on how much you want to explore. We started quick energetic and on our way back, the heat made us slow down quite significantly because of our lack of water and dehydration. Good fun though.

If you are coming to see the animals be aware that this is not service-on-demand, on our first 6 kilometres we saw no animal what-so-ever and I was starting to get a little disappointed. After a short stop, a local told us that we were walking behind a really low group and animals tend to hide and pointed out we needed to find a quiet space among the crowd to get a chance to see something. It was not easy, as I mentioned before, there is a lot of people (at least when we went there) but found a gap and did the walk, after 10 minutes two monkeys came out, chasing a chipmunk that was adorable. Both of them froze on the spot when they saw us, stood there, giving us a hard look for a minute or two and continued their merry way. In my opinion, the animals were hard to spot in the beginning because you are not sure what are you looking for. Once you have spotted one or two it becomes easier to find them as you pay more attention to the subtle changes of the vegetation.

By the way, the last tip... if you have food with you, keep it in a place that is sealed. We had half a sandwich which we tucked in our bag's external pocket and as we were walking out, my missus told me ""Honey, what did you do to the sandwich?""
Looking at it, we could notice the wrapping paper was torn out and someone gave it a bite or two. I honestly don't know when it happened but I am going to guess that it wasn't a sleeping monkey.

We only walked from the main car park to the Skywalk (about 45 mins walk for fit adults, not stopping to take many pictures, longer with children or keen photographers!), over the Skywalk and then back round via the Tower. The paths through the woods are great, there are lots of monkeys, best to watch them while keeping walking, if you stand still too long they start to come a bit too close! Great to see them jumping across the walkway. The bridge through the tree tops is great, with terrific views. Note you can only go one direction across it, so have to come back via a circular route. There are lots of other paths that we didn't take, but may some other time.
To get there, we took the bus 410 from Bishan interchange. There is 410G and 410W which basically go opposite ways round a loop. I think it is approx at the far point of the loop, so probably doesn't matter too much which you get. Ask the driver for Upper Thompson Rd (same price to all stops on that road, so you don't need to say more than that). We took the 410G and stayed on till nearly the end of Upper Thomson Rd, we got off by the petrol station. If you stay on longer than that, the bus turns right at the crossroads, where the MacRitchie is to the left. The shop at the petrol station sells drinks, crisps, cakes, so you can get a minimal picnic from it (the lady serving was very friendly). We caught the 410W back from the other side of the road. The buses go pretty regularly (every 15 mins or so, I think?)
We got a few insect bites, so some repellent might be useful, also sun cream even though you under the trees a lot of the time, and definitely some drinking water.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 23:46:11.268194

This idyllic haven is simply teeming with wildlife for those with keen enough eyes to penetrate the lush flora, and we saw innumerable lizards, squirrels, birds, insects, and a couple of long-tailed macaque monkeys, on our approximately 4 hour trek. Where your eyes fail, your ears are only too happy to step up to the challenge and are indeed almost over-burdened with the ceasless hum from countless insects, which form a pleasant symphony alongside the tiny rustlings made by invisible creatures buried deep within the brush. Although the tree top walk is the definite highlight, enabling you to spot monkeys dancing above the canopy even as it offers stunning views of the forest and neighbouring reservoir, the trails themselves are an absolute delight. Just be aware that they are somewhat lengthy and demanding, especially with Singapore's oppressive heat, so be sure to pack sun protection and plenty of water.",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 23:46:19.599474

In all we walked some 8km round trip. But the scenery is wonderful, the tree top walk was excellent and safe and the whole trip (about 2.5 hours round trip) a great adventure.
We took a cab to the location (S$13) and found a bus outside the entrance (a short walk to main street) that took us all the way the hotel (S$4 - 2 people). In hindsight, not knowing the exact location, this combination was was a good compromise. The bus trip was a sight seeing adventure in its own right.

Went for a trail walk and i must say it was quite a challenge. Saw families with young children and wondered how that could take the difficult routes when there are endless slopes and uneven grounds. I must say it will be quite a feat for children below 12 years to complete at least 5km.

I must say that this nature trail is the best training ground for runners. It will not only help to build the stamina but also the resilience to the harsh ground conditions (worst when it is raining).

Overall experience is good because of the cool air and I was quite surprised I did not get any mosquito bites when I am usually a victim of it. Perhaps it was due to my sweaty legs.

We asked our taxi driver to drop us off at the Venus Drive car park. It was our intention to walk to the tree top walkway. We started walking and heavens opened, not too bad initially but it then turned into the most intense rain I have ever experienced. 

I had activity shoes on but my wife had sandals. We were clearly unprepared. About half the trails we took were stoned or boardwalks. The rest are dirt trails and they turned to huge mud puddles because of the rain.

There is very little in terms of information (maps, signage etc). The distance signs that do exist, don't seem to give correct information as it seems you walk forever but per the signs you've gone not that far (and vice versa). Weird. 

We were lucky that the rain eased off for a bit while we were at the tree top walkway. Views were impressive but perhaps not worth the effort. There were lots of stairs up and down. 

Our adventure took 3.5 hours. You can't exit the reserve once you've crossed the walkway, instead you have to walk back (taking a different route). My advice is to prepare for bad weather, a long walk and wear appropriate footwear. There is a water fountain at the Ranger station, located about half way between the Venus drive car park and the walkway. Note there is a road that runs adjacent to the footpath to Venus drive but it is private and cannot be walked on. We had to walk to the main road to hail a taxi.

But be careful of monkeys. Do not stare, feed nor threaten them in any way- they can get very aggressive if you do.

We didn't see any animals at all and the treetop walk was a short walk over a well constructed suspension bridge. Nice view of the canopy but that was about it. The best bit was getting caught in a torrential downpour for our return from the treetop walk as the trail turned into a fast moving jungle stream !

First off I couldn't believe such a large green area existed in Singapore and that the surround forest area is in fact rainforest.

The paths are well laid and well signposted so it is super easy to follow the route the whole way around the reservoir - the whole way around was approx. 11km.

There is wildlife to see if you keep an eye out first we saw the Macaque monkeys followed by a few monitor lizards.

Other than the first section most of the route is within the rainforest so there is a lot of shade. There is a ranger station half way around near the tree top walk where there are toilets and a water station.

The treetop walk is a definite must as it gives a completely different perspective. The bridge is pretty wobbly (very safe though) and very high so if you're scared of heights it probably isn't for you! There is a lot of steps on the other end that seem to go on forever - they aren't difficult though and it was cool to have something different.

The final part of our route took us passed the edge of a golfcourse and onto a small boardwalk around the very edge of the reservoir.

Here are a few tips to make it easier to find your way for a 3.5-4 h and 10 km walk:

* Take any of the busses 132, 163, 165, 166, 167, 855 or 980 (check google map which is easiest for you). Get off at ""Opposite Flame Tree Park"" stop and go down Venus Drive.

* Entry is from the car park in the middle of Venus Drive. At the end of the car park there is a map of the trails on the right hand side (see picture). Follow the signs to Tree Top Walk that are also throughout the hike. Go counterclockwise as recommended as the tree top bridge is one-way.

* It is 3 km to the ranger hut with toilets and water fountains (in case you didn't bring any water). Then another km to the Tree Top Walk with a magnificent view.

* After the tree-top walk is the Pierce trail which is about 2 km of nicely built stairs and wooden pathways. Quite long flight of stairs right after the tree-top bridge meaning it's the most strenuous part.

* After this part just follow the signs to Venus Drive via the ranger hut (for more water:) which is about total 4 km back to the start point.

* Busses go back to city at the opposite side of the road where you got off i.e. at Flame Tree Park.

* Opens latest 9 AM.
NOTE: Mondays are closed, except if it is a public holiday.

* Probably you will see some monkeys and they are quite used to humans, which is a mixed blessing. Don't feed them. Don't carry anything in plastic bags as these smart animals have learnt that there may be food in plastic bags. Respect them and just pass by and you will both be happy of the encounter.

Neither of us are trekkers, but we appreciate nature at it's most beautiful form. The MacRitchie Nature Trail was highly recommended so we decided to do it for the challenge. It might have taken us 3 hours total (up and down the trail), and it was good that we really started early in the morning (we started around 6am) as it started getting humid when we went down around 8am.

Make sure you follow the signs, there will be a lot of people walking up the trail but the more accustomed climbers might be too fast for you so make sure you check out the signs. There's a cabin almost to the top where you can stop for a toilet break, or maybe to catch your breath. Bring water as you would need it, but do not bring any food, not even some nuts! I made a mistake of bringing a bread with a thought my husband and I can share it but since we were so focused on climbing up, I forgot it was there. Only when we were crossing the Tree Top Walk bridge and some monkeys were making its way to me that I realized they can smell the bread! I stopped for a while near the guy manning the bridge and he has this long stick to drive the monkeys away. I took out the bread, left it at the bridge and the monkeys walked past me to feast on it. How I wish I didn't have that bread on me, I could have taken some gorgeous photos of the bridge and the monkeys as well : ( But since they scared me, I made sure I crossed safe quick and put some great distance between us.

Overall it was a great experience. Who knew Singapore would have that beautiful side of nature?! Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the malls and other concrete tourist spots.",09-2015,Couples,2020-01-29 23:48:08.993941

We caught the subway to Caldicott and walked to McRitchie Park (about 500m) and started the walk at the lake edge. Soon after we were walking through the rainforest in the shade on a wide track winding its way up the hill. There was plenty of signage and maps along the route so no concerns about getting lost. It was quite a surprise that after crossing the suspension bridge that the downhill was a lot of steps and boardwalk until we got back to the main track which was a relatively short distance to Jelutong Tower (5 or 6 levels of steps) which had 360 degree canopy views and was the only time we encountered a group of monkeys about 6 or 8 of them swinging through the trees and chattering loudly but they did not bother us.
Walking along the lake edge was interesting also and we saw several lace monitors (giant lizards), squirrel-like creatures and some butterflies.

Make sure to take plenty of water as the humidity and heat will really take it out of you and whatever you do do not take food or plastic bags as the monkeys whilst cute will definitely lose any aspect of timidity to get to what they think could be food. A couple a little way ahead of us unfortunately found this out as a larger monkey jumped onto them to get the bag with some food that they must have let him see and along with the car keys that bag was the monkey's.

Started with the loop to the TreeTop walk, passed through some really lovely forest areas and enjoyed the views from the tree top bridge. Need to be aware that it is a one way walk at the bridge and there are quite a lot of steps to deal with, especially after you have crossed the bridge (more descend than ascend). The paths are good condition, some natural material so would recommend wear trainers.

After that I looped back for a bit and then took the MacRitchie Nature Trail coming back, nice but not as enjoyable as the first part of the trail. I did the short detour via the Petai Trail off this, that was so lovely with views over the reservoir and seeing the snake enjoying its lunch on the path!! (I did go passed it with some caution). Evidently this piece of trail has recently been re-opened and the latter part of the trail is still being refurbished into 2018. You are led out to the MacRitchie Trail. Hardly anyone else was on this part of the walk.

Then at the end, if you wish, it is the dam crossing and a very open area with some lovely gardens. There is also a fitness trail for those who like to run (which clearly some people do).

The park is easy to get to from a variety of buses (Venus drive stop just beyond Esso garage at the start) and for me (Lornie Road at the end, just beyond car park).",12-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 23:49:13.131549

Macritchie is part of a much larger reservoir and catchment basin located in the middle of Singapore. They have carved out a 15 km round-trip trail that loops around the reservoir, and while it takes you through some really interesting jungle (I almost got run over by what I think was some kind of pig once), it also butts up against a pristine country club golf course.

The trail is great exercise, but you should be warned: if you are not used to physical exertion in this climate then you should take it slow. The trail is not a tough trail, but the thick jungle foliage traps the heat and humidity and it will suck the moisture out of you quickly so bring at least a 1.5 litre water bottle. The Tree Top Walk is of course gorgeous, but the walkway is also really narrow so you can easily get trapped behind a group of photo-snapping looky-loos for long stretches of time.

Also, a word to the wise - keep on eye on the sky. There are shelters spaced about every 1-2 km, but in Singapore the rain can come quick and hard at the drop of a hat. I've been caught in torrential downpours that flooded the trail. It's actually quite fun to get splashed by the rain while walking around a rain forest, but it also short circuited by iPhone so I'm not sure if it was worth it or not.",05-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 23:49:22.063902

The walk is definitely worth it, some advice:
- take plenty of water and maybe some nuts to replace salts, you're gonna sweat
- take a small towel to mop your sweat
- don't take a plastic carrier bag, but instead a backpack or bag with strap, as monkeys can grab your carrier bag
- plan on a shower after at your hotel or the airport

If you fancy a good long walk follow the Treetop Walk signs which take you past the boat houses. It is all plainly signed.
Be warned this about 13 or 14 kilometres in total if you want to go all the way round. It also includes the fantastic Treetop Suspension Bridge which is awesome and not for those with vertigo. It took me just short of 4 hours and was worth every minute and every drop of perspiration. Loads to see, monkeys, monitor lizards, fish etc.
Take plenty of fluids with you, a camera and binoculars for the views from the bridge, from the top of the Jelutong Tower and coming back along the boardwalks.

Venus Carpark is located near the Flame Tree Road (which I searched). I went to Macritchie using public transport; from Commonwealth station then take 855 (actually you may reach there from Bishan or Yishun but I chose Commonwealth cause it's closer to my place). The trail can be a bit bumpy with rocks, slope, tree branches and trunks all over the ground. It is a popular place for running and hiking while surrounded by nature.

The path starts out relatively sedately around the reservoir and then you cut up through the rainforest along a track which can be uneven in places. Climbing up stairs, you come to the treetop walk which is a swing bridge high above the trees. The noise of the cicadas and birds is deafening. Monkeys hang out along the wires. There's quite a long set of steps at the far end and then you're back onto the main path which consists of board walks when the trail crosses rivers or follows the contours of the reservoir. Although I'm used to walking long distances, I found this a harder walk than I'd anticipated because of the humidity so I was glad I'd taken plenty of water and was wearing my trainers.

I had gone into it thinking it would be a quick trip to the treetops, but when I got there the distance said 5.4 to the treetops. Then the treetop trail is about 1.5k. Bring a lot of water because there is nowhere in the middle to refill.
If you plan to get there by MRT the closest is the Caldecott station about 1 k from the station to the trail head.

You landed up deep in the forest.If you are a nature lover, you should experience the MacRItchie nature trail
The 10 km takes four hours to complete but if you have someone who cannot keep upwith the pace and you have to wait for her/him you may end up five hours before
you can finish the trail.

If you bring food. eat when you are out of the sight of monkeys.
They seem sweet,adorable and certainly know how to pose in front of cameras.
But once you bring out your food they will run down from the tree to the ground and
snatch your food. One hiker walked on the treetop brought out some food. The
monkey walked on the rope and snatched the food.The tree top walk gate closes at five pm . When you pass the gate, it warns you that it is a one way traffic

This is the yellow route. You will pass by the Jelutong Tower . Climb up the spiral
steps , Reach the top and you will get a good view of the forest canopy

There is also the ranger station where people play golf. Beware when you are there,
do not use the lane that that is meant for the rangers .Do not enter or you may get hurt by the golf balls

There is this Shinto Shrine which Japanese built to commemorate soldiers who died
in the Malaya and Sumatra War. Before Japanese surrendered , they destroyed
Shinto Shrine so that it would not be desecrated.

Follow the signs closely, or you may land up heeding to Bukit Timah Nature
Reserve. You have to pass by the landmarks that I mentioned. Use a GPS
Do not walk into the forest with an empty stomach or with minimum water supply
There is no food along the trail, there are only two toilets .

We climbed the tower for a view over the area and many steps to reach the Rangers Station where the facilities are clean. You need to be alert to the many monkeys as they will snatch any food from you, they will even attempt to get into your backpack. The walk over the one-way bridge is a delight as you can look down on the trees and plants. it makes you realise how tall the trees are. We continues our walk and came out at the Windsor Park where there are huge spreading trees that attract a number of bird varieties. This spot was obviously popular for bird watchers as a number of people were photographing and using binoculars to watch the birds.

We had a leisurely stroll of about 11 km in 3.5 hours. Most of the track is level but there are some sections near the tree top walk which involve a climb.

We counted 51 monkeys, various lizards, birds etc.

It was very quiet for the middle of Singapore, little traffic noise.

Only comment is make sure you bring plenty of water as there is none on the walk (which I found a bit surprising).",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:53:01.767840

The great thing about this place is that there are several routes to run / jog or walk ranging from under 5k to around 11-12k and all are well signposted.
The trails / footpaths are all well maintained although can be quite steep and certainly not suitable for disabled / wheelchair users.
It was great to see so many people enjoying this place, just keeping fit & enjoying being outside.
We jogged & walked our way around & also took in the walkway over the valley which is where we spotted the monkey! (Another great photo opportunity)
By the time we returned to the car having covered just over 11k we were dripping wet due to the humidity & exercise.

Next, take the trail to the the Golf Course from Jelutong tower. There's an open area along the way, next to the reservoir, that you can stop at and take more pictures.

It is important to take a lot of water, hat and start early in morning cause during noon time it might be too hot.",04-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:53:45.432357

Do take into consideration that time is enough for you before the sky turns dark if you are not a morning person.

Even at this early hour, the carpark was filled with traffic, and it was totally full at the time of departure (930 am). From the carpark, a short eastwards turn brings you up the ramparts of the dam, past the kayaking sheds and into the MacRitchie Trail. To the left, the boardwalk trails (Prunus and Petai) which we didn't try. The MR trail leads (generally uphill) to join the Terentang trail which leads to the TreeTop walk; this section took us about 30 minutes along a generally shaded stony trail. A westward loop along the Sime Track brought us to the Jelutong tower, which we didn't climb this time (saving our energy). The next part of the trail loops southwards part the Singapore Island Country Club, and this environ was much more open (read: hot!), with scrubby forest /reservoir to the left and the manicured greens of the SICC to the right. The southernmost border led into the Jering/Chemperai (boardwalk) and Lornie trails. The boardwalk trails were generally quieter with views across the gently rippling waters of the reservoir, while the Lornie trail was much more undulating, requiring several climbs up and down. The boardwalk walks met with the Lornie trails only once, with the Chemperai boardwalk being the longest stretch. Finally, back to the MacRitchie park with much more manicured gardens to enjoy. The circular trip is around 8-8.5 km, and supposed to take around 4 hours. We managed it in just under 2 hours, but that was a fast-paced endeavour.
Pros: greenery, much variety, nature, exercise and well-marked trails (this is as safe as it gets in the tropics!). Cons: the trails were crowded, even at 7 am in the morning, and spandex-covered joggers were much in abundance. I guess peace and tranquility is in short supply in densely-populated Singapore. The usual caveats apply: bring water, wear appropriate clothing, and be prepared for heat and humidity.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:53:46.539031

Being awhile since I came, I did not expect the place to be clean, and peaceful. I'm here for 2hours and im glad i manage to try the treetop. This close early so it is good to reach there before 4.

This is the place to come if you look for nature and enjoy trekking. There is a choice of road of 5km or 10km. At times you get to see monkey but do not try to disturb or feed them. I guess the same for all countries.

Manage to take some nice shots of the reservoir while jogging. Not easy to jog as there is uphill and downhill. This really can train up stamina.

Hope you enjoy the nature trail

,1,16,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/amyunderwater,342722682,26-01-2016,4,Beware the Monkeys,"I went with a group of friends (30 - 70 years of age) and took bus #166 from Chinatown for $1.80 (SG) which took about 40 minutes. Compared to taking the MRT with several transfers, it is about the same time but I recommend taking the bus! It is so great to see sights from above ground, like the National Museum of Singapore, Fort Canning Park and cool buildings like the old Police Building or old Fire Station.

But for the trail!! We got of the bus and immediately saw the first monkey. It was so cool! Then part of our group (the 70 year old) separated to run the circuit trail, which took him about an hour. The rest of us walked the trail which was so lovely because you can pick between the rough trail or the plank board trail. Careful though, both trails were really wet and slippery and one of us bailed down a set of stairs : |

On the way back, a group of monkeys followed us for about ten minutes and we all thought it was cute and innocuous until a larger monkey started circling around my legs and jumping at me. A women started telling us to ""Just walk away!"" so we did. A moment later another monkey came running down the path towards me so I used my water bottle as a block. It grabbed the water bottle like it was a prize and ran off with it. It went about 10 feet from us, plopped down, unscrewed the lid, poured the liquid on the ground and drank it all! I wanted to avoid the $1000 for littering so we wanted until it was finished and threw the bottle out. We speculated that the monkey knew the bottle I had was a ""Sports Water"" bought from the venting machine at MacRitchie and the others my friends had were from the hotel and that the monkey probably knew the sports water was more sweet then the the plain water in the other bottles.

So just a recommendation, the walk was beautiful and amazing but please watch out for the wild life because they are in fact wild! Not cute little pets!",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:53:55.710519

If you do not hail from South East Asia rainforests are particularly hard to come by so it was a real treat. It was busy today ( Sunday) with slightly varied terrain. We took the 'Tree Top' Walk which was amazing to walk across the suspension bridge to see the full panorama and feel you were amongst the tree tops.
It took three hours and we are reasonably fit and walked at a medium pace. My advice is start early ( even though under the canopy of the rainforest it is noticeably cooler) as it was really hot at midday when we finished. Also if you are afraid of heights probably don't take the ""Tree Top"" walk option. There are others to choose from. And it's free.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:54:02.481620
