We sat inside to take advantage of the air conditioning and received a friendly welcome with a great atmosphere. We ordered an egg and bacon roll and poached eggs on French toast not knowing what was about to happen.
Apparently my wife’s French toast was great but my egg and bacon roll was without doubt the best I have ever tasted! I’m not sure what the seeded bread roll was but the total flavour was superb.
Next time we visit our family in Singapore we will definitely return to PS",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 06:10:37.110785

One of the reasons why this place is so ideal for family with young kids is it’s proximity to East Coast Park, the largest in Singapore .
15 Km of a scenic coastline with cycling tracks and all sorts of water sports as well as cafes and restaurants , this place caters to all ages .
I particularly come here to just sit on one of the benches close to the sea and enjoy the sound of waves .
Whether it’s early morning , noon , evening or night , strolling by the beach at East Coast Park just gives one such a sense of calmness .
So if you want to take a break from hectic sightseeing and just want to relax and unwind , then do visit East Coast park once during the early morning or late evening .",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 06:10:37.523807

You can’t visit without trying out the Hawkers food. There weren’t a lot open at lunchtime, but the food we found and has freshly cooked was scrummy. Great value too.

If you have the time, you should explore running, walking or cycling along this stretch along the beach. Be rest assured that you are not alone as many locals and foreigners enjoy coming here for the sun, sand and sea.

If you are wondering where to start, then I would suggest that you begin your day of outdoor fun where the McDonald's is located.

Around that area, you will be able to rent bicycles, roller blades, and even canoes. If you feel like having a BBQ, you can also rent a pit along the beach. Do note that prevailing or pits is required and you can do so through the Singapore National Parks website.

Make sure you come in comfortable gear to enjoy this wonderful outdoor place.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 06:10:47.020294

A beautiful green strip with playgrounds, grass, jogging and walking tracks that is not particularly easy to get to unless you have a car. Access to bus/MRT is not particularly easy. However it is rarely crowded during the week, a peaceful place to relax. There are numerous places to eat and drink along the way. The beach is surprisingly clean and the water is calm so there is no issue for swimming with kids. I don't think many tourists come here, as most of the people we saw were locals, and some school groups.

The East Coast has lots of lovely restaurants. We went at 6.30 pm - perfect for catching the last of the sun as it set.
Sit outdoors under the sky if you can - getting a stiff sea breeze is the main course in my books.
We went to the reliable Jumbo Seafood where one crab is a hair-raising $88. But everything else is well-priced, and simply but competently made, with lots of wok hei. (“Breath of the stoves” which you only get from the high temperatures of an industrial kitchen)

On the day we went, there was a sand castle building event by the sea. Some extraordinary art was on display. The waters are choppy and not great for bathing, but worth a dip. It also seems to be a great place for fishing, from what we saw

I couldnt help myself and had a good run along the great pedestrian track. The kids did some skating. I also saw some bays meant for barbeque parties, which seems like a great idea.

Jumbo Seafood has a sea-facing restauarant here and naturally it was abuzz with people. There is also a food court area that serves superb grilled stuff thats much more affordable. They specialise in satays, with rows and rows of shops offering this, and other grilled meat/finger food. Its tough to find a seat though.",10-2018,Family,2020-01-30 06:10:48.428996

Government of Singapore decided to join all the parks with 'connectors' so one can ride a cycle all round the island through all the parks and return to the same point.
East Coast Park is 14-km long on the ocean between Changi Airport and Financial District. One can cycle without worrying for any traffic, within the park on a cycling track which is different from several walking paths. And all this on a eye-pleasing ocean front.
One can rent bicycles, family cycles, skate wheels, skate boards, kids cars and much more from the many shops all over the 14 km track.
There are several ponds and forest areas. The entire park is shrouded in trees.
There are sand areas to swim or for children to play and build sand castles.
There are play areas for children.
There are several break-out areas for entertainment.

Miss this huge beachside park so much! There are many underpasses from Marine Parade road, Meyer Road, Upper east Coast road making it easy for joggers and bladers to cross the ECP expressway. Cyclists may need to carry or push bikes up the steep ramp.

We've seen many reincarnations of the various restaurant and leisure areas. When we first arrive around 2003, there was still the Big Splash waterslide (badly maintained with chipped slides by then) and the old MacDonalds and Burger King.

Loved jogging during the day and our regular Family cycle every sunday night. This is a very safe and familly friendly environment even at night.

Best thing a the kids grew and could bike/jog further was the variety of things to do and places to eat. Easy to hire bikes, pedal carts, springy boots, remote control toys. basic shower and toilet facilities along the main paths. Singapore largest skatepark opposite the Bayshore road underpass and a Wakeboarding lake near the Bedok entrance. Whatever happened to the Mana Mana seasports place?

1) Rental shop near Parkland Green, East Coast Park
Unfortunately i dont know the name. They do not have family bikes. However there is an option for Single adult with Baby seat at $15. Single bikes are $10 for 2 hours! Even though it was on a weekend(CNY PH). that's crazy cheap! The bikes are new, they provide mineral bottles for free! They mentioned its ok to return a little late and it was a very kind gesture. We did return on time though. Very excellent service and we will definitely return.

2) Rental shop at carpark C
Their typical family bike (sits 2 adults and 2 small kids) costs $30/hr which the bigger bikes (sits 4 adults and 2 small kids) costs $40/hr. Offering additional 1 hr free on a weekday. Staff are friendly and good. Generally round up the time so u can cycle longer.

3) Rental shop at carpark E2
The only shop that does not offer free 1 hour on a weekday. Bikes are older, staff are ridiculously rude. They are strict on enforcing penalty on the time rule, strict to the minute. which we would have gladly paid except we found out every other shop had additional 1 hr. It was hard to make it in time as the kids were tired and we had to spend a while to handle them, unfortunately the shop had to make us pay $60 for 1 hr +. Whatever family fun we had was destroyed thanks to them. So, avoid the stress, avoid the cost, avoid the place. that will do. It was ignorant and lack of checking that led us to this place.

,1,32,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/IAN G G,457258409,05-02-2017,4,What a lovely huge park next to the sea!!,"I have never seen such a huge part which runs on the entire coast of Singapore for many kilometres. And most of it is natural. With lots of eateries and a huge children's park near Marine Cove, this becomes a very nice place to visit if you want to visit a non-tourist area. In fact, this park was recommended by a local friend of ours. Otherwise, it was not on our agenda earlier.

Tips/observations/points to remember:

1. How to reach - we took a bus and got down at Marine Crescent, Blk 45. From there we had to walk through a residential complex called Marine Crescent Ville towards East Coast Park Road. We had to then cross the East Coast Park Road through a long pedestrian tunnel which goes underneath the ECP Road and emerges straight into the park near the huge children's play area. This part of the park seemed to be the most happening with lots of eateries like McDonald's, Burger King nearby and Cycle Max from where you can hire cycles. When you get down at the bus stand you can see signage of the tunnel, you just need to follow those. This area is the Marine Cove area and as per our judgement seemed to be the most happening area of the huge park. Frankly, we would have covered just 10% of the park which is huge and runs along the coast.

2. Best is to go in the morning or evening. We went in the afternoon and got fried in the heat. But the park had lesser people. It is very hot in the afternoon. So, in case you go in the afternoon, you could carry umbrellas, for protection from the sun.

3. There are lots of eating joints and options. We went to McDonald's as we had a 6 year and a 14-year-old and you know how crazy they are about McDonald's. The Mcdonald's is at Marine Cove and is a huge one which is very nice. There are lots of other eateries in the same complex. We also noticed a Biryani joint.

4. What we did - frankly because of the heat we couldn't do anything much. We hired a 4 seating cycle which all 4 can pedal and we must have ridden some half a kilometre only before the heat got hold of us. You can hire all kinds of bikes from Cycle Max which is located nearby. Well, for locals this park seems to be the favourite to do barbeques. There are hundreds of barbeque counters which are already constructed and which you can book on the net. Each counter is numbered. All you have to do is get all the barbeque stuff and go to your booked counter and enjoy a barbeque. Well, we did not do anything of this sort. I just noticed this while researching on the park. There is a beach next to the park and you can go swimming in the sea. I think you need to get all your stuff like towels, etc. in case, you want to go into the sea. We didn't see any arrangement for that. You can also do skating, cycling, jogging, etc. There are lovely non-vehicular roads made all along the park where you can do all these activities. There is a huge children's park though you can do hardly anything much in the afternoon because of the heat.

In spite of the heat, we and our kids really enjoyed the visit to the park. I recommend this part to anybody staying near the East Coast Park and who has some spare time in hand.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-30 06:11:52.135354

Best place for jogging and cycling. Water skating is available in the park at a minimum cost.
Beach is clean and safe for swimming. Coastguard patrolling is there for security purpose. The landing and takeoff of aeroplanes are able to see from east coast as the changi international airport is at one side of the sea shore. The ships anchored near to the east coast beach give a mind blowing view during night time. The lights from the ships resembles some kind of celebration.
The most important attraction is food- nearby food court is a food paradise. There are about 60-70 hawkers running variety of food stalls. Almost all international cuisines are available in that food court. Open air seating and the freshly cooked hot food with a chilled beer is sufficient to fill the stomach and mind of every visitors.

Sad things is maintenance is not good and it is already deteriorating.
Local seems to be do not care to take care the places so it getting bad every time we visit. I hope those taken care of public spaces should be taught as basic education during the young age since most of adults are behaving badly.
Place can be full of garbage due to such selfish people's actions and cheap foreign labors come and clean the place which I found very unethical.

Its really only a place to visit if you are staying in Singapore for quite some time, but even then there's not much to see or do. Your best bet is to rent a bike and cycle from one end of the park to the other - basically covering one quadrant of the island (you'll also end up at Changi, near the airport). The beaches are basically deserted because the water is so murky, so swimming is a no-no, and there isn't a whole lot of flora and fauna to make it worthwhile for nature lovers. At best, there is a newly constructed children's playground where Marine Cove used to be that could prove enticing for families with a long vacation here, but otherwise, don't put this in your list of ""must-do""s in Singapore.",11-2016,Family,2020-01-30 06:12:00.093052

There were people cycling , scooting, playing frisbee /Badminton, having picnic or camping and it was indeed a vibrant park!

The new playground at Marine Cove was super packed with children and their caregivers! I didn't expect it to be that crowded. My daughter was quite disappointed that she couldn't play there because we didn't want to risk her getting all sorts of virus such as HDMD from others.

We had dinner at babalicious located at Marine Cove and sat at the outdoor area overlooking that playground. While waiting for desserts, we realised that the crowd at the playground started to get lesser as it was getting dark and we decided to let her play for a while there. She was overjoyed. The good thing about dining and sitting outdoor at Marine Cove is that you get to see the playground from where you sit. Kids can wander off to the playground after they're done with their meals while adults can continue to chat at the table.

Generally, the park is still as clean as ever and there are many food choices too. There are bicycle kiosks for people to rent bikes as well. At the other side of the park, there's prawning and longkang fishing activities too. We also saw 'Diggersite' as we drove along the park. It's a make-believe site for kids to have role-plays by operating on machinery such as crane at the make-believe construction site. We didn't try it this time round and may do it the next round.

All in all, East Coast Park is indeed a wonderful recreational place for the young and old!",07-2016,Family,2020-01-30 06:12:35.825502

Try hiring a bike from the many hire stores, about $8 for 2 hours, and head towards Changi.

A good option is to visit the East Coast area where you could make yourself closer to the sea. Its primary recreation area, the East Coast Park, is the best strolling ground in the country. Walk, jog, and bike in its more than five kilometers of walkways and bikelanes along white sand beaches. Picnics in Singapore are best done here. Swimming is not so much encouraged, but you can wet your feet in the gentle waves of the Singapore Strait. Across the sea, not far in the distance, are the infinite tankers and cargo vessels that still remind you of the country's position as Asia's trading hub.

Restaurants front the sea with their offering of seafood and other specialties. This is Singapore's seafood district. Try Jumbo's chilli crab and cereal prawn. If you want hawker fare, the East Coast will not disappoint. The Katong-Joo Chiat area, walking distance inland from East Coast Park, is a renovated copy of its early 20th century self with its colonial architecture. Chili crab, laksa, kwehs, and many other Singaporean specialities found their beginnings here as this is also the home district of the country's Peranakan and Malay communities.

To reach the place, take the MRT to Paya Lebar. At Paya Lebar Square, take a bus to Parkway Parade or Katong-Joo Chiat. Buses that go to East Coast Road, Joo Chiat, and Marine Parade Road will take you here. To get to the East Coast Park, alight at Parkway Parade, walk to Marine Parade Central (there's a big hawker center here), then pass by Fair Price.

It was a Friday and the schools in Singapore had begun their end of year holidays so there were quite a few groups of school aged children at the park who looked as if they were on an organised outing as part of their 'out of school care' while their parents were at work.

I walked from Section B to Section C stopping on the way to have a sit down and look out to sea at the many ships anchored there. It was very hot, but luckily there were enough seats in the shade. I would imagine that on weekends it would be more difficult to find somewhere suitable to sit due to the crowds.

I arrived at a complex which housed a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf café, a few other local restaurants and a very big McDonalds, so I decided to have lunch at McDonalds.

It was absolutely packed with big groups of school aged children, however the queues moved very quickly and it wasn't long before I managed to find a seat outside where I could relax and eat my lunch.

I was very pleased to see that, in addition to the usual McDonald's hamburgers and fries, they also served ready made sandwiches and salads.

The thing that struck me is that Singaporeans seem to take every opportunity to get out and about with their families enjoying every parkland space which is available for recreation, and that's as it should be.",12-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 06:15:56.393485

However do be careful during high tide as the water can get rough and eddies will form.

One is able to walk on the foot paths along the beach or cycle on the adjacent cycling paths. Rental Bicycles are available. Many visitors like to exercise there as the air is clean and fresh. Public restrooms with shower facilities are available as well.

There are many food and drink outlets along the park, and a very large and fun (challenging) children's playground near McDonald's'.
Besides restaurants and coffee houses, there is a large food court as well. Do try the Curry Puffs (Lagoon) there as they are excellent. There is also a mini Satay Club there. Also try the Laksa (Roxy) and Wanton Noodles.
Also within the park is a Seafood center where several of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore is located.

It is best suited for kids as well. Taking express pass may be required on weekends but you can convert your entry pass into express anytime inside. I would recommend you to visit few rides and check waiting time before buying express pass. Below is my honest opinion regarding the rides/activities I have done

1. Transformers: Good one. It's a virtual reality experience. They keep changing themes now and then. Must go if you are a fan. You will be sitting in a car/vehicle which will be moving in a fast pace in all directions. Wait time: 30 minutes. Ride time: 1.5 minutes

2. Battle star Galactica (Human/Cylon): Must visit. Human is a easier version of the rollercoaster than cylon. Cylon takes you upside down and goes through water rings which will takes you in shocks. You will not be able to anticipate the next move of the rollercoaster. Wait time: 10 minutes. Ride time: 1.5 minutes

3. Accelerator: You can skip. If you are tired from other rides, you can rest here. Wait time: 10 minutes. Ride time: 1.5 minutes

4. Jurassic Park: Contains 3 rides. Canopy flyer, water raft ride and one more for kids. Wait time: 30 minutes. Ride time: 1.5 minutes each. Note: Locker is paid here, you can keep your belonging with you and also keep your electronic devices in polybags.

5. Mummy: Good one. Hard to anticipate vehicle moves as it will be dark everywhere. Keep your back straight while doing it ( I hurt mine :( ). Wait time: 20 minutes

6. Treasure Hunt: You can skip. Wait time: 30-40minutes and not worth waiting. It will take you in a small jeep like vehicle and slowly covers a small circle.

7. Water world: Good show. Get seat in front. You can get soaked with water, so keep your electronic devices safe. Wait time: 5 minutes as show times are specific. I watched 7:40PM show. Show time: 15minutes

8. Enchanted: Good one. Small ride. Wait time: 10minutes.

9. Shrek 4D: Good 15 minutes movie. Specific show timings.

10. Steven Spielberg Show: I missed it but it is said to be good.

The cabbie took us to where there were some hawker food stalls and heaps of places to sit. There are undercover tables and chairs all over the place.

First things first, we ordered a bucket full of ice and bottles of beer and then, one by one (there were four of us) we would each go to a food stall and come back with a plate of heaven ... there are different cuisines, Malaysian, Cantonese, Singaporean .. pork, steak, noodles, seafood ... you name it, they had it.

As we were eating and drinking, we were taking in the surrounds and the people .. so relaxing .. there was a Chinese guy, he would have been at least 80, bald on top with the hair on the sides of his head reaching his shoulders, 8 inch beard ... and he was in full Lycra riding a cool road bike ... this is a favourite place for cyclist going by the number there.

The view from the beach was a bit industrial with countless tankers and container ships moored offshore but the water looked nice and relaxing.

There was a tow skiing place just down the beach and a bit of a fun park with restaurants and other amenities.

We recently discovered the western part of ECP, which skirts the National Service Resort, Sea Sports centre and golf course. This well maintained cycle/walkway meaders through the coast line, with some lovely treescapes. You are in the line of the Changi airport runway, so you will be serenaded by the occasional A320 taking off, but other than that, it is a really pleasant and accessible early morning exercise spot.

It is also interspersed with restaurants, coffee shops and smaller shopping malls.

However, East Coast is distinctively different from the other two Gardens because of its sea-side location. The sand on the beach will never be as soft and smooth as those from other countries, but it has everything else you expect from a beach-side park - picture the warm sea breeze, families on picnic, teenagers on rented bicycles, and the like.

Tip: ECP is a linear strip along the banks of the beach. The quieter spots in East Coast Park are towards the two end of the Park where its less crowded and more peaceful.",11-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 06:18:42.486739
