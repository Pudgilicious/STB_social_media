Fireworks started at 1045pm and continued with few breaks until midnight. Seems like the whole city was there, so when it was time for everyone to leave, there were some intense crowds. Thankfully the mrt ran well past midnight and we were able to take it all the way home.
There was also a carnival set up on one side of the bay, not far from the Sands hotel. We didn’t spend much time there but it was a fun atmosphere! Hard to do crowds with the stroller tho.",01-2020,Family,2020-01-29 22:50:06.356734

Now, the whole area has been more and more developed keeping Singapore at the forefront of beautiful and exotic cities with incredible attractions to visit.

I still remember the land reclamation project where all these incredible structures now stand. Now you can walk around this area from 1 Fullerton to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel with fabulous views of Marina Bay, the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Singapore's financial district.

The best time to visit is in the evening time, at blue hour if possible, until night time. All these spectacular buildings and attractions are lit up at night giving wonderful opportunities to take some very special photos. If you are a photographer then definitely bring a tripod.

My recommendation is to begin at Merlion Park and then make one's way round towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel passing through the Helix Bridge and ArtScience Museum. All along this route you will get the most spectacular views across Marina Bay and even capture many of the small tour boats that arrive from the Singapore River.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-29 22:50:34.053300

The place is mesmerising and like something out of an Avatar movie. The Supertree Grove in front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel was wonderful, and you can go on the aerial walk way within its ‘canopy’ for around £8. The views over the gardens are excellent.

You can even have a meal in the base of one of the larger ‘trees’ and there is a lift to take you up to the top.

There are lots of things to see and do, and you can easily spend an hour or two just walking around the well maintained and beautiful grounds. Entrance to the gardens is free, but the ‘dome’ and walkway are extra.

Either way, it’s a must see when visiting Singapore.

Get there by cab, it should be no more than 12-16 SGD from just about anywhere downtown. Tipping isn’t expected.

The vast Gardens by the Bay is located directly behind the hotel & definitely worth a visit - also at night it takes on a completely new persona when it’s colourfully lit up. There are many (& mostly designer) shops in front of the hotel which attract a lot of visitors. On the opposite side you have the old colonial Fullerton Hotel in complete contrast to the modern buildings around. The many tall tower blocks of the business & financial district sit close behind. Crowds gather to visit the popular Merlion statue. The best way to experience this close up is to jump on an electric powered boat tour in nearby Clarke Quay & enjoy the guided trip along the fascinating waterway leading to the Bay Area. If you time it right in the evening you can be in the bay as the nightly laser show is projected from the Marina Bay sands hotel. Another crowd pleaser. It is now possible to walk the entire way around the Bay Area taking in all the various & diverse buildings & attractions along with the atmosphere.

Visitors to Singapore should put Marina Bay on their bucket list. It depicts modern Singapore in one sight. It has different identities one at day time & another one at night time. Both are soothing & attractive. This very systematically developed bay gives a clear picture about Singapore skyline, spectacular view of famous landmarks like the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade, the Singapore flyer, the Helix Bridge, the Art Science Museum, the iconic Merlion, super-tree groves & so on. Total Marina Bay area is surrounded by near about 06 MRT stations so it is very easy for excess. At night, the whole area becomes magical, colorful & blissful. Laser show, spectra the light & water show, colorful tree groves bring life to the area.

The whole area is very wide so it's better to go there in the afternoon & then continue up to evening to have both views. During midday scorching light may directly lead to discomfort. The Marina Bay Museum and ArtScience Museum could be visited for learning about Singapore's history and its advancement in the new era.

I went to Marina Bay again to take photos for my review. The whole place was jam-packed with tourists and locals. I then realized it was a Sunday and the rehearsal for the National Day Parade (NPD) will be held in the late afternoon towards early evening. So I waited like everyone else and in time to capture some unique photos.

Marina Bay is a bay located in the of Central Area of business Singapore surrounded by the perimeters of the four different areas. The entire area surrounding the bay itself is an extension of reclaimed land to the adjacent of the CBD (Central Business District).

In the early days of sailing ships the whole bay area was called the Inner Roads where a detached mole was built for safe anchorage of merchant shipping. With redevelopment and reclamation the whole area was transformed and the mole took the area where the Marina Sands Hotel and Gardens By The Bay now stands.

The Marina Barrage, a integrated work of gates and machinery was built on the mouth of the Bay towards the sea. Completed in 2008 it cut sea water from the Bay and transforming Marina Bay and the Kallang Basin into a fresh water reservoir that will in future provide another source of drinking water. The Marina Barrage also prevent flooding in the downtown area including Chinatown. Both the Kallang River and the Singapore River empty their waters into the bay. The crafts that use the waterways now are boats carrying tourists for the Singapore River Cruises and boats for water sports such a dragon boats, kayaks and sailing boats races.

Marina Bay was transformed into a mix of uses for this area, including commercial, residential, hotel and entertainment, including 3.5 km Waterfront Promenade around the perimeter of the bay. Both locals and tourists can be found hiking, cycling or jogging along the walkways. There an interim event space and public space used for activities such as theatres, bands and carnival shows. A floating platform rightfully called the Float is currently used to house the National Day Parade.

The whole area is well served by several MRT stations, bus stops and taxi stands are well placed As the Bay area spills in to the adjacent CBD many banks have set up head offices and 5/6 star hotels such as Marina Sands, Fullerton, Pan Pacific and the Orient hug the other shores of the bay. Concert Halls and Museums too compete for space. The year end F1 races where Singapore is credited for its night races hug the areas around the Anderson Bridge and the Esplanade Bridge section of the bay.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-29 22:55:30.121481

For those who like shopping there is a complete mall presents famous brand.
For those who like culinary there is also a restaurant that serves a variety of menus that can meet your tastes.
For those who like others please visit Art Science Museum at the Marina Bay Sands.
Or you can sit and relax while enjoying the beach at parks and gardens.
Or.... If you want the easy way enjoying The Marina Bay just go with Singapore Night Sightseeing Tour with Singapore River Boat Cruise.
But for those who want stay much longer please stay at the luxurious hotel located around the Marina Bay.

It also has a food mall and an internal river which tries to ape the Venice concept of the Gondola but ends up being very expensive so avoid that.
The best part is when you arrive at the viewing area and can see the entire skyline with the Marina Bay Sands hotel behind you.
Go during evening around 6 pm and stay till 8:30 pm, that way you can see the skyline and the city go from day to night and catch many stunning views in the backdrop while getting yourself clicked.
They also have a sound and light show which is not as good as the one in Gardens by the Bay but if you have time then go. There is a lot of walking involved so get a pram if you are with a child and once on the viewing area - sit, relax, take in the sights and sound while savoring the experience of Singapore. All this at no charge since everything that you see and sit is free unless you want to purchase something from the shops or the food vendors nearby.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-29 22:56:34.735217

However - it is always jam packed with people who actually don't seem to shop. And forget trying to get something to eat in the food courts....you will never get a table unless you pick a table and stand by it until the occupants have finished eating. I find this awkward to do!

There is a gondola that goes up and down the length of one of the malls. A very cheesy attempt to replicate similar rides in Las Vegas. Not sure how much it was as we gave that a miss.

You can access the MBS Skydeck from here, but this is also a very expensive attraction that has restrictions placed upon tourists and those not guests of the hotel.

Furthermore, the MRT station is also always packed and there is always a long line to get tickets.

,1,15,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Rupert1200,437272669,15-11-2016,4,A great place to soak up the 'new Singapore',"If you want to get a sense of how much Singapore has changed in the last 15 years or so, then a trip to the Marina Bay area is a must. Firstly, you will find yourself pretty much in the middle of the Grand Prix road circuit and if you take a close look at certain street you will see how the infrastructure has been set up for the night races. In September when the F1 show comes to town the transformation is quite phenomenal. I am a great fan of motor racing in general although I have to say that the road course is a bit of a compromise. It is mostly too narrow for real overtaking and and tends to slow the cars down. There is an area just before the end of each lap down at what is called the 'floating platform' where the cars have to make a sharp right followed almost immediately by two sharp left turns and another right angle right. It acts like a kind of chicane and is only there because there is an area of permanently fixed seating facing the bay itself.
For the arts, the area is famous for the Esplanade (lovingly termed 'the Durian"" by locals because of its stunning similarity to a very popular, but stinky, South East Asian fruit). This is a real world class venue and there is always something worth watching either in the theatre or the attached concert hall. Not far away also is the lovingly restored Victoria concert hall.
If you are a foodie, you will enjoy this area and the nearby outlets in the Bras Basah area. It is possible to find pretty much any kind of food and almost anywhere can be considered safe. My wife works in the F&B line and she is pretty happy to dine anywhere. Because this is a major tourist area, the prices are on the steeper side. When we go to the theatre, we tend to grab a bite at one of the outlets adjacent to the Esplanade. Harry's Bar is a favourite and they have definitely improved their food (it wasn't always brilliant). There are some great Japanese restaurants that serve some reasonable fare as well so, once again, choice is not really a problem.
All in all, be prepared for a fair bit of walking. Perhaps start off at a place like MBS (and the attached Shoppes By the Bay - hate the spelling ""shoppes"" by the way!) and then proceed around the edge of the bay. Have your camera ready, especially at night, as there are some spectacular pieces of architecture both old and new.
Of course, like anywhere in Singapore, if you are on foot carry an umbrella (I like those neat little fold away ones) because sooner or later you are going to get caught in one of our famous downpours.",10-2016,Family,2020-01-29 22:58:01.926532

Buildings change colour, Nija climbers go up and down the building and sky divers appear from the top. You will be standing for more than an hour but get there early and there are some seats and lots of cafes that fill quickly.
Another popular thing to do is the sea boat and river boat rides. Some include meals ,some just drinks and the cheapest you take your own water. Water is vital in Singapore. If there is rain people don't use umbrellas but cool down. It's hot in the morning , boiling midday and hot at night. When you first get off the airplane you will gasp for air. This is a sauna. All year round it's mostly the same.
Marina Bay has the Singapore Flyer, like the London eye. Museum's, shops and the aquarium. It's full of glamour and you may find musicians, dancers, shows. You will find hawkers lots and lots selling laser pens and fake watches. This is the bottom of the market so don't expect them to last.

If you're a tourist and have just a few days in Singapore , please make time to visit the Marina Bay. Go in the evening, see the Merlion, drop by the Esplanade, walk round the bay in full circle and take in the views. There's a food centre showcasing the best of our street foods-- Glutton by the Bay (right after the Esplanade). Set aside 3 to to 4 hours here.

,1,15,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/rodrigoelp,563279866,28-02-2018,4,"Whenever you see images of Singapore, you are looking at Marina Bay","Singapore has an interesting mixture of architecture and functional decisions all around the city, this can give you beautiful contrasts between classical design and modern practical spaces and there is no better example to this than Marina Bay.

It would be a lie to say Marina Bay is the most beautiful place in the world or Singapore, but at night it shines with its own light (sort of speaking... in reality, it shines with lasers and light beams coming from lots of different buildings )

I have mentioned in a different review that, areas around Marina Bay are particularly void of commercial activity in the morning, activating itself slowly throughout the day becoming a beaming spot and the centre of attention of the city at night. Sort of like a frat boy that parties through the night and crashes before dawn, sleeping all morning and waking up for a brunch at 3 pm, just to repeat everything once more as the days go by.

What does it offer?

- Stunning views of the most iconic buildings in Singapore.
- Art and culture expressed by several theatres and some museums.
- Amazing shopping experience with a gigantic (the definition of gigantic is subjective) shopping mall ready to take you in.
- Good restaurants.
- A relaxing atmosphere
- A bit of the fusion of cultures composing the picture of current Singapore.
- Did I mention the views?

What does not offer?

- The classical/traditional Singapore, for that you need to go to little India, China town or the Arabic town.
- The history behind this organised and super clean place.
- The nature as almost everything around here is completely artificial... and I got to tell you, Singapore has some beautiful views of their landscape and natural places. The natural Singapore is well reduced to small pockets spread around but quite beautiful and well worth visiting.

Have this in mind, is hard to describe the experience without rambling for too long and it will depend on what you appreciate the most. I liked the food and atmosphere around. Took photos like crazy of the Marina Bay Sands and the bridges, but a nature lover could easily get bored of these views quite quickly.

To get here, get out of the subway at Raffles Place, City Hall or Bay Front stations and enjoy.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 23:09:14.084021

From seeing the marina area as an empty space of recently reclaimed land to what it is now is truly astonishing. Even the Merlion has moved a few yards further out, as it was previously in the other side of the road which previously didn't exist.

The Sands Hotel, part of the skyscraper skyline and the barrage didn't exist 11 years ago, and the marina has changed from sea water to a freshwater lake. You will never be bored here, especially with the extra entertainment, fireworks and music at the River Hongboa during the Chinese New Year period.

I would recommend starting in the early evening around 6:30pm when it starts to cool. There are many possible starting points and routes. Following is one suggestion.

Start at Raffles Place (take the train there) and walk to UOB Plaza to start your walk along the Singapore River. You will see Botero's Bird Sculpture. Walk south (downstream) towards Cavenagh Bridge. You should see some local sculptures (see if you can spot Kucinta and her kittens). Cross the pedestrian bridge and turn right to head towards an underpass leading to Queen Elizabeth Walk. Walk along the bay (on your right) and head towards the Esplanade (locals call it the Durian as it resembles the fruit). You may wish to go into the Esplanade for some cool air-conditioning and grab an early dinner in one of the many food outlets/restaurants such that when you continue on the rest of the walk later the sun would have set and the buildings in the area would be lit up.

The second part of the walk along the bay would be from the Esplanade to Marina Bay via the Helix (pedestrian) Bridge. If you prefer the outdoors you may continue your walk to Gardens by the Bay else you may stroll into the Marina Bay shopping area as an alternative place to find dinner. To complete the round trip, take a boat taxi from Marina Bay to cross back to Fullerton Bay. The Clifford Pier restaurant at Fullerton Bay is also a great place to have a nice dinner. At Clifford Pier, walk towards your right and you will reach the Merlion Park. On this side of the bay you will be well positioned to watch the free 15-minute light and water show courtesy of Marina Bay Sands every night at 8pm and 9pm (and additionally at 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays).",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 23:10:35.084920

What we did and what worked out really well;

We arrived at 5.30pm to the bayfront station and got a view outside the marina bay sands hotel in daylight. We then headed back into the mall, enjoyed the christmas decor and shops and had some dinner.

There are plenty of food places on B2 and B1 right at either end of the mall.

By the time we finished dinner we heades outside and it was dark. I was mesmorised with the tall skyscrapers and lights across the marina bay. It was a spectacular view!! Take some photos with a proper camera here as your phone may not capture the light action!

We headed east out of the mall towards the helix bridge. Have some fresh coconut ice cream or melon ice cream from the 2 stalls located just before the outdoor theatre.

The first fountain light show starts at 8pm and lasts 15mins. Either watch this right outside the mall or from the seating area just before the theatre by the bay. Spectacular lights and music.

Wall further across jubilee bridge to see the merlion statue which is better at night than day i believe. You can complete a full circular walk along the bay back to bayfront station.",11-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 23:10:55.504741

Everyone has a sales spiel and it is a typical tourist trap with sales people trying to snare you into their shop. Look but don't take up the invitation to sit down! They sell boat rides at $10 per person (including young children) on the very short boat trip along the artificial canal in the shopping centre. Big queues show that some people have more $$ than sense. Some pleasant parks to stroll through but not in the rain and a lot of interesting architecture for photo opportunities.,10-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 23:11:30.397298

Check in was chaotic & extremely slow & staff did not advise customers that they would need to tap their room card in the lifts in order to access floors above level 5. Additionally, when we checked in, our room was not ready & altho' we had no issue with that, we were not told the room number allocated & were therefore unable to book our lunch at Aquamarine to our room. Later, we returned to Reception with the 'Handy' electronic device that had been set-up in our room. It did not work & required re-setting, but staff did not offer to do this or provide a replacement. They just told us to take it back to the room (the next room user will also be inconvenienced). The gym facilities are terrific, altho' the loud & repetitive music nearly drove us to distraction. Fortunately this only happened twice! The pool is very aesthetic, but no shade over it & no change room facilities either. As for the bars, very difficult to find staff to serve you & there did not seem to be any smiles to be found anywhere. Whilst the quality of the hotel is very good, I think the staff need to interact & care for their customers much more than we saw during our 3 days.

And try to have a wirlpool in the club where u can enjoy relax time while having a spectacular view with not too much crowd like @the pool.
The food just normal. Nothi g special. And 1 thing that makes me not feeling this is a 5stars hotel is their lobby. So crowded. When my 1st visit on christmast n new year vacation with family it was also sooo crowded i thought we are not in hotel but in public market. And my hubby told me probably because it was a high season. Then we visit again on april still same just a bit less crowd.

From Esplanade, there will be an outdoor free live band usually from fridays and the weekends. Walking down the Promenade to the Floating Platform, it's a nice stroll.
After which there is the mini park with some wall murals before reaching the DNA helix bridge, Magnificent photo stop. Then go on down to the ""Lotus Flower"" Art Science Museum which marks the start of the MBS promenade walk.
On the weekends, at about 9 or 10pm, there is a free outdoor light show, a little like Hong Kong's light show. It's not bad, worth to watch once.
Then if u need a break, can walk around MBS, go up to the sky observatory or you can just go to any celebrity restaurants/cafes in MBS for a short stop. Then you can walk on to the Fullerton Bay hotel, Fullerton Hotel where there is the Merlion Park (One Fullerton).
There are nice bars and restaurants here as well, as well as the famed Merlion of Singapore.
From there, it's very near Raffles Place MRT if you need public transport, if not that place is filled with cabs. :)",06-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 23:19:05.390659

Easily accessible by public transport with several MRT Stations in the vicinity and with pedestrian walkways, jogging areas and bicycle areas.

They have kept some interesting things along the way to play with to keep the crowd active, like 4D lights, kids fare etc. This place is also known for it's fountain show. Make sure you reach well enough if you want to grad a place to sit, otherwise people dont mind sitting down on the deck as well. Also in my opinion watching the show from the upper section gives you better view, although crowd will run to grab a place downwards. The show is about history and culture of Singapore and someone like me wouldnt be able to connect more other than for it's graphics and little water drops that fall on you. Akshardham's fountain show is much better. :P

You can see all the commercial banks from here. The auditorim which looks like their national fruit Durian, some high budget showrooms like 'louis vuitton' and it also has a mall connected to it.

The gardens by the bay, botanic gardens, zoos and other attractions are much better.

Also worth noting we did not stay at the hotel - I am sure the roof top infinity pool would be rediculous.

You have an amazing shopping centre, where you can shop until you drop, or you can pop into a little coffee shop or wine bar and enjoy the splendours they have to offer.

You can see the Singapore Flyer which looks so pretty. They do a lazer show which is amazing, so make sure you take your camera. Along the broadwalk you can find many places to eat and drink until early hours of the morning if you want.

One more thing which is amazing is the Sky Park which is a boat on the top of three towers, and its actually a hotel. You can actually go to the top, and see some spectactular views over singapore.

It is also a great place to escape the heat for a while too.

Outside you can walk all the way around the bay and pass by some jaw dropping hotels that are definitely for those on a few dollars more than me! Gorgeous and stunning doesn’t do them justice. The Marina Bay Sands is a spectacle but the Fullerton around the other side looks breathtaking too. Checkout the lobby. Wow!

The business sector skyline looks great at night alongside the Sands hotel and the whole area is a place where you can take so many pictures - night or day. The bay also has museums, boat trips and the light and water shows add to the atmosphere. Add the F1 event and the buzz is off the scale.

A great area to wander about, people watch, eat, drink, take 100s of the same pictures, keep fit and suck in the views!",09-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 23:24:20.871321

Well serviced by the MRT, but there is a bit of a 5-10 min walk involved no matter what station you alight. For great city views, come at sunrise or at dusk. During the day, the walkway along the bay is not sheltered and you will get the brunt of the sun. Better yet, do your research and book a hotel room overlooking the bay, city side.

The entrances aren't that well signposted, once I'd found it it was obvious but I missed it the first time I looked.
The city doesn't seem to encourage pedestrians above ground, I had to take a long detour to find a way around the barriers and cross the road.

Once at Marina Bay we arrive on the back side and rode around almost the whole way to the Bread Street Kitchen.

I would recommend combining a visit here with the nearby civic district (comprising the National Gallery, Asian Civilisations Musuem - see picture of map), perhaps starting with the museums in the late afternoon. To get from the civic district to One Fullerton and the Merlion, you need to take the underpass located under the Fullerton Hotel (I've noticed this isn't sign posted at all or perhaps I missed it).

The light show is not in my view particularly spectacular; a bit cheesy. The restaurants at One Fullerton are also not fantastic. From One Fullerton, you get the money shot of Marina Bay Sands hotel.

It is a pleasant and warmth welcome. Best time to land in Singapore would be in the late morning to mid afternoon where the ride is a breeze avoiding any form of traffic.
It is a Shopping Paradise for those whom wants to check out the latest fashion and to source for the latest electronic gadgets and hardware, etc. or, to dine in the many eateries / restaurants found located along the famous 'Orchard Road'. .
U can download 'Grab' App onto your mobile phone to book a car conveniently, to bring u anywhere efficiently. . from just about anywhere in Singapore.
After Shopping, in the evening at +_7.30pm.,
It would be great to take a few nice photos from the Boat Ride, starting from 'Clarke Quay' in the City, and end up having dinner along the Quay, and u can enjoy some night life and listen to various music offered there, as well.
If u r with your Family,
Please bring them to Sentosa Island for a day trip. . U may even decide to book a hotel room there. I found the 'Hard Rock Hotel' to be decent and value for money. The number of activities available at Sentosa are far too long for me to state formerly in Trip Advisor... and please don't forget the Singapore Zoological Gardens at Mandai. Your kids will love it. Please dress casually to enjoy the stroll.
Do also bring your kids for the 'Duck Tour' ride, located at Suntec City at the Exhibition and Convention Tower Block of Marina Centre in the City. They will love the ride on the amphibious vehicle. There again, more shopping and food....
For the Solo Traveler like myself,
I urge u to try and reside in the 'Fullerton Hotel' and spend some time at the Marina Bay Sands'. It is comforting and beautiful. Remember to take the Lift up to the Rooftop 'Pool Deck Level' and have yourself a well deserved rest and a drink absorbing the panaromic view from up there at +_5.30pm.
Singapore has many other areas of interests. . from which u may discover them on your own, when u collect the brochures from one of the Top Airports in the World, at Changi International Airport
Prior to your departure, do drop by at East Coast Park, 'Jumbo' and or, 'Long Beach' Seafood Restaurant' and try out the Black Pepper or, Chilli Sri Lankan 2kg Crabs'!!. Super juicy""!!
At the Airport,
you may even decide to check-in earlier before your departure, just to enjoy the facilities and any last minute shopping, if required.
There r 03 terminals linked by mono-rail ride for free, to bring you around. U can even taste some local food at B2 of Terminal 03. Many other restaurants r also found on Level 02 of Terminal 02. And much more to Offer. . Just for your info only;
There is a future mall being constructed in front of Terminal 01, and Terminal 04 to be opened soon.
Meanwhile,
Wishing u a most pleasant flight and stay whilst in Singapore.

The Flyer is set there also as is the mouth of the Singapore River. You can tour the Bay by boat, recommended as well as you can walk around the entire area, also recommended.

Twice a night, there is a light and laser show in the Bay which is shown against the Marina Bay Sands complex. It is a 15 minute show (reviewed separately) but part of the Bay experience once for sure. Tons of restaurants and famous hotels nearby also.

I enjoyed taking in the Bay from several viewpoints on both sides as well as from the Helix Bridge and also from high atop the Sands at the View Point some 56 floors up. This area makes for some great photo ops too from several viewpoints each with slightly different breathtaking views.

The boatride gives you pretty much a view of the Bay from the water so you get to see all the buildings up close including Merlion.

The daily Lights Show in front of MBS coupled with the audio effects is beautiful to behold. The added bonus is that it comes free if charge! With the Sgp National Day parades floating platform nearby, it simply adds to the magical atmosphere.

A great place to walk around the bay to take in a 360 degree view of everything in n around it.

But if you prefer the hot weather of average 31 to 33 degrees then go ahead to enjoy the sunny weather.
You can also go to the Casino and enjoy a game or two but do not get carried away. If you win some monies it’s fine and better to stop while you can.
If you lost, set an targeted amount and gracefully exit before you regret losing all your monies. Hahaha. Enjoy and have a great time.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 23:35:55.185758

There's a hawker (Satay by the bay) where you can stop for food / drinks.

It gets pretty dark at the Barrage (not much light from nearby buildings and very dim lights to guide your path) and as it can be quite windy, you will see some people flying kites. It is peaceful there and it's quite nice to just sit there and enjoy the city from afar or stare into the still water / darkness.

A circle around the bay goes through Merlion Park (can be reached via Raffle Place Station), Julibee bridge with corlorful flowers, Esplanade Theater, Helix bridge and finally The shoppes at Marina Bay. Highly recommend to walk if anyone want to enjoy the view easily. It takes around 45 to one hour to walk without stopping the whole circle. Be aware of people near Merlion as there are so many of them anytime any day. Also, there is a watershow performed each night and can be seen on both sides.

While daytime strolls form a good perspective and show off some of the visual treats on offer, a twilight and night walk can really emphasise the experience.

Eitherway, there are a range of eateries and cafes - but the seating is limited and its recommended that the Light show schedule is checked and tables reserved accordingly.

Walking around the perimeters of Marina Bay will take you to some of the most stunning, exciting, scenic, historic, beautiful and entertaining attractions in Singapore.

First of all is the Marina itself, an artificial bay created by the damming of the Singapore River to provide water supply, flood control, and water-based entertainment and activities.

Then there are the Gardens by the Bay, the Marina Barrage, the Marina Sands, Raffles Place, the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, Merlion Park, the ArtScience Museum, the Fullerton Hotel, Clifford Pier, Theatre on the Bay ... I could go on an on.

The reality is that Marina Bay is an amalgam of both historic Singapore and the modern City State.

Walk towards the Marina Bay Sands building . You can go into Shoppes (pronounced shoppies!) , the mall at the base of MBS and walk past all the designer shops and expensive cafes, enjoying the respite from the heat. Note: Twice nightly there is a sound and laser show across the Bay. Watch it from the tiers of steps outside Shoppes for the best view of the images projected onto screens of water. To get the best view of the lasers, watch from the other side of the Bay....the rooftop bar at The Fullerton Bay Hotel is a good spot or there is a Starbucks open until gone 11pm. Returning to the walk, leaving Shoppes pass the white lotus shaped building (a science exhibition centre) and follow the Bay around, crossing over the celebrated Helix bridge which gives great views of MBS and the CBD. Pass the Mandarin Oriental hotel and the floating sports pitch and head for the Merlion statue, always surrounded by crowds of tourists. Note the splendid Fullerton Hotel on your right which was the old Post Office. Carrying on round the Bay you pass bars and restaurants and eventually you find yourself by the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Walk through the Lobby of the hotel and back to Raffles Place. The circuit of the Bay takes around an hour at a leisurely pace.",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 23:40:45.856519
