We were asked at the first video to remove our child as the tour guide “had received a complaint”. We were 10mins into the tour, our group consisted of 3 other people - just to put things into perspective.

My advice would be don’t spend your money on this tour unless your children are of an age where they fully comprehend ‘don’t utter a sound’. Otherwise there’s a fair chance you’ll be asked to leave the tour and therefore miss interesting information about the war. Something that is not mentioned when booking the tour but definitely worth knowing.

Granted, we were predisposed because of more than a passing interest in military history, and I also had a Great Uncle who was an Australian POW at Changi. We got so much out of it and the context of the Japanese advance into SE Asia (talk about a Blitzkreig - it only took 55 days!) and the Fall of Singapore really came together for us. The tour guide (I've forgotten her name) was amazing - so friendly and enthusiastic, and she made it come alive. Honestly, if you like a good story, the arc of General Percival's wartime tale is fascinating. My son paid extra attention to everything, memorising all the details as we went, because the tour guide said there'd be a quiz at the end! He knew the answer and his hand shot up, but unfortunately for him another kid was picked to answer first and got it right. The prize was a reproduction of the Japanese surrender document (another fascinating story in itself) - my son bought a copy with his own money, and I noticed it's now sitting proudly above his bed. We also enjoyed the lush grounds, where it would have been nice just to walk around there admiring the greenery. Just outside the Battlebox entrance is a frangipani tree with flowers in a gorgeous shade I'd never seen before -- solid butter yellow.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 04:29:07.192242

The maps, historical artifacts, wax statues of the important figures to this story, the interesting story angles coupled with the great story-telling skill of the guide helped guests in immersing in the experience. I'm sure they've selected trained their guides well --- we've especially enjoyed Joanna's tour and her thorough and lively explanations of events.

Our main gripes were that this tour is conducted entirely in English. Our guest who was a true blue war veteran but non-English speaker, still enjoyed the tour, but we had to literally memorize everything on the spot and translate for him only after each section ended. Their older knees couldn't quite take the hour-long standing too. Wonder if it's possible for any improvements?",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 04:29:23.587769

Unlike other museums, Battlebox is an authentic WWII underground command centre in Singapore. It showcased a variety of exhibits in bunkers and relevant old videos were shared of what happened to Singapore under British ruling then. We learnt about the strategies used by the British commanders before Singapore was surrendered to the Japanese.

Our tour guide, Esther was knowledgeable and we had a better understanding of what had happened to Singapore during WWII after the tour. However, it would be better if we could be given more time to look at the exhibits especially the prints on the photos displayed on the walls.

The tour is only an hour and fifteen minutes which is definitely insufficient for one to explore further and take a closer look at the artefacts and displays in order to have a deeper understanding of the happenings.

Moving forward, the management could consider allowing visitors and tourists to take pics at selected sections in the bunkers as they could be kept as fond memories.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 04:29:24.907283

With our tour guide telling us the story of the area and history of the surrounds.
There are short videos played in some of the rooms of the fall of Singapore to the Japanese army in WW2.
This underground bunker with about 27 rooms was facinating and beyond believe 300 plus men living down there with the attacking Japanese army on the door step.

The infamous attack on Pearl Harbour often overshadows the story of Singapore when telling the story of the war in the Pacific. By visiting this informative and atmospheric relic of WWII my adult son and I learnt that Japan's intentions for domination of south east Asia were deliberate and immediate with the invasion of Malaya begining the day after Pearl Harbour and ending with the surrender of Singapore and 100,000 allied soldiers two months later. This solemn representation of the decisions made by the allied commanders and the subsequent impact on Singapore's civilian population (300,000 people disappeared over the next 3 years) was an eye opener and had far reaching impacts on the war. As an Australian it is part of our history that more should be aware of and shows how woefully prepared the allies were. The only thing that would have been an improvement was if the knowledgeable presenter had allowed us to ask more questions rather than being pushed from room to room.

The tour was a mixture of talks and videos on the build up to the Japanese invasion, the tactics they used and the way that the allied forces were forced back into Singapore and finally to capitulation.

Artefacts and photographs give a real sense of the desperation of the British in the final days of the battle and the eventual end of the war.

Amid today’s commercial and financial frenzy, you forget that Malaya and Singapura were the British Empire’s military hub in Asia and hold important pages in the history of WW2 for the Commonwealth.

We took 11am guided tour with our two kids (7,5) and their two friends, also 7. Would definitely recommended the guided tour with kids as it keeps the information crisp and focused for the little ones over 75-90 minutes. Special highlights for the boys being the soldiers’ toilets and everything that comes with that. Older kids can probably self guide but I always recommend using the knowledge that is available from people who have actually studied this stuff rather than guessing.

The tour is a walk through the various rooms of the underground bunker, 9 meters/3 storeys down, with artefacts, maps, recreations of the decision making moments and obviously the story of what unfolded so swiftly in the Battle of Singapore in 1942. I don’t think it is wheelchair friendly, did not see any elevators.

Book tickets ahead as the BattleBox is small and underground and they obviously keep group sizes small otherwise it would get loud.

Tour guide was no nonsense, military style, kept the kids in check. They will ask noisy or uncontrolled children to leave as it is a bunker and the sound echoes. Note the dad with toddler who was asked to step out of the room several times and missed a lot of the commentary. Put a bit of a downer on the morning and made me as a parent a little more anxious of my kids’ behaviour.

But if your kids are well mannered and can listen to direction, you’ll be fine. The reception building has souvenirs, drinks and ice creams for the well-behaved ones (and for adults too).",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 04:31:02.057605

I knew a bit about the surrender of Singapore, but I learnt a lot more, and of course you are actually in the place where the decisions were made. They also show you some interesting films of the invasion of the Malay peninsula and the surrender of Singapore itself. So if you have an interest in WW2 this is a must. We got there just before opening and beat the rush for the tickets.

The tour is really good because you get a good overview of the history of Singapore as well as an understanding of the forces that were at play in South East Asia during WW2. But don't think this tour is for history buffs; it is for anyone who wants to get an understanding of the history of Singapore including the decline of the British Empire in the Far East. Perhaps the strongest element was the way the guide brought to life the narrative of the people who worked in the Battle Box, those affected by the Japanese invasion and the terrible dilemma with which Percival and Simmons wrestled.

With Britain struggling to fight on two fronts and Europe being the priority, it left Singapore very defenceless when the Japanese invasion came.

Our tour group consisted of about 20 visitors and our delightful and very informative tour guide Nancy. Adult tickets are $18 and good value. To enter the BattleBox, you have to descend a number of steps down into the bunker, from then on you are guided through the many underground rooms where the British commanders plotted strategy and defence against the Japanese invasion. There are very lifelike full-size models of the military commanders who made the decision to surrender to the Japanese, it is quite a poignant and sobering recreation.

Despite being urged by Churchill to fight to the last man, this is where where Lt-Gen Percival and his allied commanders decided that they had no option but to surrender to the Japanese, a signal defeat that marked the beginning of the end of the British Empire. Percival was not the greatest of generals but we learnt from our excellent guide, Anu, that he faced overwhelming odds. He had no air cover, no naval back-up, no tanks and was running out of food, ammunition and water. The room where the last meeting took place is enlivened with realistic figures of Percival and his men gathered around a large table.

It is a guided tour through the rooms of the bunker that moves fairly fast through each of the rooms, and combines photos, staged props and short films. Our group included a 5 year old and his 70 year old grandparents. Our guide Sharul was knowledgeable about the events, and was able to convey history in an engaging and easy to understand way.

Request to management: please do not replace guided tours with audio. It is more enriching to have great guides to lead you through. Perhaps provide the option of both instead?

This tour in Fort Canning park is terrific. There are no graphic images, but it is moving, especially for those who were directly impacted by these events or had relatives who were fighting here.

No special fitness required, is well lit, and has a.c.! Tours are capped at a certain amount. Recommend booking online or get there 30 mins prior to tour. Our 1.30pm tour on wed was full.

I went a second time with visitors recently and enjoyed it even more. The guests were very impressed with the tour and the information given. The re-creation of the people involved is so well done.
I heard that they may discontinue the guided tours and make it a self guided tour instead. I think this would be a mistake. Part of the appeal is that the tour guide takes you along through history, telling you the story of what happened. It is a relaxing easy tour and you walk away with more knowledge than if you simply walked through reading plaques. I would happily bring any visitors to Singapore we have, though if it becomes a self guided tour I would hesitate. We could get the same information walking through a museum reading. I recommend this tour for anyone, even if history is not your thing. I do hope they continue the guided tours as this is no ordinary museum.

My son is big on WWII stuff now so we brought him for his birthday and we had real fun. Our guide, Joanne, was friendly and informative and addressed the questions of his curious audience, which mostly consisted of Caucasian tourists. We took a short 3-minute walk to the start of the air-conditioned tunnels. It's definitely not a tour for screaming kids or those who might be inclined to claustrophobia. The tour was a mixture of presentation by Joanne and watching three videos. The best part of the tour was the parts of the tunnels which were from the time of the war (doors which were sliced to allow for more ventilation, Japanese writing etched on the wall, a generator of sorts). There are a lot of realistic wax sculptures and interesting production design to recreate the final days of WWII. Our guide told us about how they might be changing it to allow for a self-guided tour, though I kind of like the personal human-element of the tour. I craved more WWII artefacts to be on displayed within the tunnels. There's a nice store which sells interesting books at the end of the tour.

My whole family thoroughly enjoyed this tour; it was interesting, informative and very well presented, as well as being comfortable (air conditioned and with seats for when you were watching one of the short videos).

The tour should have been 1-1.25 hours; in fact, we ended up spending 1.5 hours as there was so much to talk about. The tour was an interesting mix of short videos, looking at replica and real artefacts and photos and the talks given by Eisen.

Since our hotel was close to Fort Canning Park we wandered through the grounds and to the top for the view. We noticed a few signs along the way about the battle box, not having heard of it before didn't dwell on it. We entered the air conditioned information centre and were asked if we were there for the tour, with a few details explained we had signed up for this new tour and were eager to start. What a tour. Great tour guide, full of information and patience.

I also had with me a teenager who is studying history (WW2) at school. I have to say that the tour and the guide were most impressive. There is a lot more audio visual material than before and a lot of historical fact but not so much as to bewilder or confuse. The group was small - only 4 of us - but that helped with the personal approach of the young guide. All of the questions from the group were answered smartly and the little quiz at the end was a good way for the guides to see if they had got their message across. It is still a work in progress but it is well worth visit and the agonising and exhausting climb up the steps from Dhoby Ghaut MRT in the 30 plus temperatures. To avoid this, approach from the east along Coleman Street and veer left on to the more gently sloping road which runs behind the National Museum.",04-2016,Family,2020-01-30 04:33:40.204799

The tour includes photographic displays, artefacts, short films and life like models of the main participants in the fateful decision to surrender. It is well worth the visit and is easily accessible from Dhoby Ghaut Metro Station. From there, it’s a short uphill walk to the Battlebox. If it’s wet, take a short, inexpensive taxi ride.

We didn't know, that Britisch troups had to surrender. So we really were surprised about the great and very engaged introduction, we got from the guide at Battle Box. Questions were answered completely and professionaly, which showed a solid knowledge of this part of history. Additional video spots completed this all and gave a good overview to the historical background. It was also amazing, that the dedication was given to the'bave men' - british soldiers - who handled this critical situation in a very good and moderate way. It is great to see, how the people of Singapore include these events as an integral part of their own history. This fits to the care with that architecture of British origin is kept and maintained in the city of Singapure.without withholding the new things, which point into future. That's what makes me liking Singapore so much. The Battle Box is part of this great tradition!

1) You may, as we did, go there by taxi, as the ticket office and the facility itself is high up on Fort Canning Hill and Park. The best way to get there is by taxi. But one problem. Getting a taxi to return is very very difficult. The Battlebox office team called repeatedly for a taxi for us and none arrived. So we decided to brave it and walk down lengthy steep public stairs down the hill and then find our way to the nearest bus stop. At least we were going down, not up.
2) Absolutely mandatory: if you are interested in seeing where the British high command actually surrendered Singapore to the Japanese, you must visit the Former Ford Factory (that's what it is called) on Bukit Timah Road. There the Singapore authorities have created an extensive exhibit detailing the horror of the surrender and the Japanese occupation --with film, interactive displays, and a reconstituted boardroom where the surrender documents were signed. This visit is an absolute must

I’m ashamed now to realise how little I knew about what happened in WWII in this part of the world. The tour was an eye-opener - informative, most interesting, and also very moving. I just wish it was better and more widely promoted for more people to know about it and visit.

I’d read on T.A. that you couldn’t pre-book, but phoned the visitors’ centre in the morning and they reserved places for us on the 1.30pm tour; we paid when we got there. Glad we did, as the tour, which can only be about 20 people (as rooms in the bunkers are small), was fully booked.

Our guide (or docent), Matt, led us through the rooms, set up as they would have been during the war. He explained how the war strategy and tactics were developed, how information was received and analysed, how communications worked (or didn’t), and what everyday life was like down in the bunker. We learnt the tragic events that unfolded, and watched short films, with footage I had certainly never seen before - final shots of the surrender of Singapore to the Japanese and gathering up of prisoners were very moving. Matt was a great guide, very knowledgeable, and answered all sorts of questions from us. We thought this 90 minute tour was very well organised, interestingly presented and fascinating. It really brought events to life.

Practical tips
We arrived quite early, thinking we would grab a cold drink and sandwich at one of the two places on the Fort Canning Park map we took to be cafes. Unfortunately these turned out to be the Fort Canning Hotel and the Lewin Terrace (both very plush upmarket restaurants! ). So, if you need to, grab lunch at a cafe outside the park. The visitors’ centre sells a few cold drinks and crisps. Nearest loos are in the Fort Canning Exchange House, about five minutes from the visitors’ centre.

We also had a very pleasant walk afterwards round Fort Canning Park...really lovely place with loads of shade from all the trees and some good views down over modern Singapore. We ended up walking through the park to Clarke Quay (about ten minutes ) and catching a boat trip on the river to Marina Bay, and then having food at Lau Pa Sat hawker court, which all together made a great day trip out in Singapore.....reliving the past and looking at the future of this great city we love coming to!

The underground tunnel and the communication system used by the allies was toured and our guide gave a detailed account of the workings and eventually the very difficult decision to surrender.

Our guide, Diah, was really friendly and very knowledgable during the tour. You are walked through the bunker areas, including strategic rooms and living spaces, and there are also some video presentations about the invasion of Malaya and the defence of Singapore before its invasion. I will say that the tour is quite lenient and sympathetic to the British army officers' situation, and focuses purely on the Japanese invasion and the surrender of the British. Due to the bunker's original purpose, of course the tour does not go into depth about the Japanese occupation of Singapore, or the eventual liberation of the island. This is a good overview of the start of the war in Singapore, and then there are other places to go to learn about the later war years.

The vast majority of reviews were positive so i thought that it might be a worthwhile trip and I'm glad I went. Although my wife and I had a little difficulty finding where to get tickets to the attraction and just missing the compulsory guided tour in the morning we eventually got on the tour in the afternoon. The young lady who guided us was enthusiastic, cheerful and very knowledgable. I had not long before read a book about the Singapore capitulation and the young lady recounted these facts accurately and with some passion. The tour through the underground military operations complex was very enlightening and certainly gave me a different perspective on what the people in there may have experienced during the period immediately before the surrender of Singapore - particularly the vast number of people who eventually ended up in there - and the lack of adequate sanitary facilities for these numbers. The lack of air conditioning on its own would have been challenging in the heat of Singapore and in close, cramped quarters. Luckily today the air conditioning works admirably and gives visitors a respite from Singapore's heat. One item that stands out for us was the mannequins representing the main senior officers of the time. We found them very lifelike and they really added to the atmosphere being generated by the guide and the story behind the surrender. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the guided tour and would certainly recommend it to others who may have an interest in this tragic period for Singapore.

Our guide was one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides that I have ever come across. He was ex Singapore Army with the rank of Sergeant and his knowledge of the campaign was, as you would expect, extensive.
The command centre is extensive, consisting of some 29 rooms or thereabouts with some period equipment, numerable cameos and films taken at the time depicting the run up to events on the final day of the battle when the decision to surrender was taken.
Clearly from the British point of view it was a total shambles from beginning to end with a lack of equipment, resources and adequate prior planning the overriding factors.
This was all clearly presented and it was very much a case of 'all of us' versus the Japanese.
Leaving the tour left you with a very sad feeling that we let down not only ourselves but also all of the people of Malay and Singapore. We knew a fair bit about this period of history but learnt a great deal more on the tour.

Our two young guides were able to explain how the situation developed and what life was like in the underground command centre in an accessible and interesting way. They had an in-depth knowledge of the subject and despite being assessed by their more senior colleagues spoke clearly and confidently.
The underground bunker has some confined spaces so it is recommended to book a tour in advance.

Very well informed, articulate guide. A huge amount of fascinating detail, leaving a completely different perspective of Percival.
The tour provided a mass of fascinating information, and brought to life the terrible position the army leaders were left in, with no air cover or sea power.
The tour itself takes about an hour and a half - and if there are items you missed, ask at the end of the tour. S$18 and two hours really well spent.

The Attraction is centred around the fall of Singapore to the Japanese in World War Two.
In fact it consists of viewing the underground bunker where all the important decisions were made. As so, it takes in all the various strategies and plans which resulted in the eventual surrender of the country.
You have to take a conducted tour with a guide who explains all of the important decisions which led to the downfall of the country and which eventually dictated the future of Singapore.
The tour was fascinating but possibly a little expensive as it cost us thirty six Singapore dollars (about twenty five pounds) for just over an hour.
Overall, I would say it is well worth experiencing this Trip whilst in Singapore.

Anyway we picked the first tour of the day which we were pleased to have done as there were only 12 of us on it. The next one had at least 20 and spaces down there are tight.

The guide Mel was excellent and gave great insight into the events around the surrender of Singapore. Lots of pictures, a couple of short films and rooms recreated for how they would have been.

You can't take photos down there, however I guess that preserves some of the detail for the day.

An excellent tour that brings history to life and certainly makes you think.

A 5 min walk from the MRT so easy to get to too.",08-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 04:44:52.288687

My reservations about the tour however, were quickly forgotten. the tour was insightful and so interesting. I learned a lot about WWII that I never knew I even wanted to know. Our tour was led by a lovely woman (I believe her name was Jen). She was insightful and made learning fun.

The battlebox itself has been restored as much as possible, with the inclusion of photos and information along the walls, as well as some displays. It tells the story of the surrender of Singapore during WWII.

The only downside was, we were ushered into rooms to watch videos (which were fascinating), but not given enough time after to look at the photos and read the information in the walls.

The Battlebox Tour isn't really about the rooms there, although they're fascinating of course. The Tour is about telling a story, the fall of Singapore, something we thought we knew but found we didn't.

S$18 gets you a look inside the actual bunker where the British made the decision to surrender to Japan on 15th February 1942. [ I found out it was the same day that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbour.] Our tour leader was brilliant. He was a well informed young Singaporean man who had recently served in the Singapore Army. He was a real font of knowledge. The Battlebox is a different kind of museum that explains the true causes behind “the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history”. The tour guide was brilliant but you should go soon as we were told that the guides are about to be replaced by the inferior 'recorded, self guided tours'. It won't be as good as hearing it from a local.
When you look on the map BattleBoxt looks a bit difficult to reach by public transport but it is just stones throw from Orchard Road.

If you are doing a tour of WWII history, this is a must for your list. You walk through a number of rooms with wall displays as well as an explanation from your guide.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 04:46:13.115383

Then it was self guided and each room told a story with the characters of the day telling a narrative in the form of automated mannequins. 10 years later and much has changed for the better - this time we were guided by a very informative guide called Shar. Ex Singapore Army Infantry officer and now guide of the newly renovated Battle Box, Shar shared with us his incredible knowledge of this facility, the events leading up to the invasion of Singapore and the final surrender to the Japanese. Have a guide share his knowledge of the events that took place in this area and also the historical events of the time was brilliant. The museum needs to continue using guides for this experience.

The tour is performed with qualified and certificated historians who have a passionate link with their country's past and prove to be excellent ambassadors for Singapore when relating the history to visitors.

Parents traveling with children must consider this really isn't an interactive tour as children cannot touch or play with the exhibits. Realistically, children under the age of 8 or 9 would not find a great deal of entertainment on this tour as there is a lot of historical 'fact and information' related to Singapore and as we all know - kids hate schooling at the best of times !

On top of that, instead of being a crusty old historian, he's young and full of enormous enthusiasm. I think the tours go at 11a.m. and around 2 in the afternoon. We didn't book and although we did easily get onto the morning tour, we discovered it's probably best to do so.",01-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 04:47:36.358287

Included are some audiovisuals that help to explain the story. The bunker is air conditioned and is easy to walk around. My only reason for giving an overall score of 4 out of 5 is that the guided tour is compulsory and there is not enough time to fully read the many excellent information panels and appreciate all of the images. Our guide definitely deserves 5 out of 5 ! Two points to note: the signage in Fort Canning does not make it very easy to find the ticket office and entrance.

My partner and I decided to take a tour of the historical Singapore Battlebox during our stay in the city November 2016. Whilst we were aware of the major points of Singapore history whilst under British Governance the Battlebox tour focuses on the fall of the city during World War 2.

With this in mind, I'd break my review up into two distinct parts; the Battlebox fortification itself and the company behind the tour Singapore History Consultants.

Firstly on the fort itself, this tour doesn't take you to a building that's survived the test of time expecting it to tell you a story on its own. The Battlebox doesn't do this as it has been preserved and repaired to such a state that modern day visitors can freely visit. To enchance this, each room with historical significance has been fleshed out with mannequins and furniture so that it's relevance will be understood when encountered. Small details like British and Japanese graffiti have been preserved too.

Moving onto the Tour Operators, I can only offer the highest praise to both the shop staff and the tour guide provided by Singapore History Consultants. The shop staff were welcoming and full of suggestions on things to do during our stay. Jerome our guide for the morning was a perfect dichotomy of manners, knowledge and charm. His sphere of knowledge wasn't just limited to the Singapore campaign but expanded to the entire Japanese theatre of war across the Pacific region. For those that might be doing their family research or know military participation in this part of the world, you'll gain a little bit more value.

Ps. There were 2x arrogant fat old men on our tour- one of which interrupted our guide to inappropriately boast his knowledge - which she was going to be covering in the next room...

Just turn up at the visitor's office at Canning Fort - we talk a short walk uphill from Dhoby Ghaut MRT station - and if there isn't a tour starting soon you can kill some time in the nearby Art Centre or its cafes.

Our guide Jey (which he explained means ""victory"" in Sanksrit) was knowledgeable and passionate in equal measure. The tour was scheduled for 90 minutes but took 15 minutes longer - it didn't feel like it, fascinating throughout.

The best thing you can do in Singapore

Plus you can spend a lot more time walking round Canning Hill. We didn't - too hot. And lazy.",10-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 04:48:58.009669

The restoration has been done to an exacting standard and the tour is presented in a
totally non judgmental way......you form your own opinion.

Our tour although advertised to be 90 minutes actually took over two hours becasue
we were all so interested and asked so many questions of poor Jerome.

Current:
- More video clip is available.
- More room are open to member of public.
- Some pictures on the wall . (pls remove those screw so that avoid further damage on the wall).
- More cooling compare 20yrs ago

Different:
- Tour guide was wear those kaki uniform.
- Last time the souvenir shop was inside the battle box.

suggestion /improvement :
- Create sound effect in the planning rm /sighted plane rm . example : voice of communication and siren sound. Type writer sound in the room. Ppl walking hurry along the corridor.
- create of unqiue souvenir. Buy a yellow metal dring cup with a engrave of battle box logo on it. I have one of such item which got it during opening of Johor battery around earlier year 2000.
- place seat at tourist visiting centre. it seems not enough seat and we have to stand around.
- change the voice of narrator in the video clip. Perhaps get hoarse and deep sound to present it. At least sound like a military officer present video.
- Put a dummy soldier near the entrance with a stop sign. At least tourist can feel the start of the tour.(last time got this display soldier)

No prohibition of any photos or filming there, too. Interestingly, one would think that from the opening of Japan to the West in the 1850’s.The whole entire country underwent in less than 2 generations, underwent a thorough modernization and massive industrialization, in a very short time. This very important OVERLOOKED oversight should have made the British government very aware of what the potential talent and ability of the Imperial Japanese military could accomplish in outperforming and easily defeating their British adversaries. Especially, during the Russo-Japanese war 1904-05! Another thing, the Imperial Japanese army had a very easy time handling the British military from the get-go in North Malaya.

At the beginning of our tour our guide (unfortunately forgot her name) said we would be quizzed at the end!

We walked a short way to the bunker entrance and got a bit of history on Fort Canning and some of the remaining above ground attractions. After walking into the bunker our guide closed the heavy entrance door behind us.

The museum did a great job recreating the settings, both artifacts and figures, in various rooms to represent the key people and activities on the final days before Singapore’s fall to the Japanese in WWII. The movies and our guides great knowledge helped us better under the events and definitely made this one of the best guided tours I’ve joined to date. Well worth the admission.

I was awed by the conditions that these soldiers had to endure to stay protected and keep lines of communication going through out the war.

At the end of our tour we had a wrap up back in the gift shop and our guide followed through with her quiz. One prize for children and one for the adults.

The tour was already full but the tour guide was gracious to include us. The rooms in the bunker were decently mocked up, and in some rooms the guide gave us a few minutes to browse the maps and posters on the walls. The tour was well paced and the guide was engaging and interactive.

It was a fulfilling 1hour and 15min experience at SGD20, although I would have loved to hang around a bit longer in the bunker to let the story and experience sink in.

I’m not absolutely sure why it’s guided, as there seemed to be plenty to read and see (which we didn't always get a chance to fully read), and the a/v elements filled in the gaps.

Nevertheless it was a pleasant tour despite the subject matter. It added another layer of detail on the short war experience of Singapore on 8 Feb, 1942 to a week after that. We saw the room where Percival apparently capitulated although he supposedly went into that room looking for ideas on how to counter-attack. If our guide was to be believed, it was the pesky Aussies in the room who wanted to wave the white flag and who am I to doubt her.

There were only 5 of us, which gives us the luxury of asking questions and taking a slower pace. Before the tour start, we were given a bottle of cold mineral water (thanks!)

Our guide, Poh was very knowledgeable and experienced. She was also attentive to all our questions and answer them patiently. I enjoyed listening to the stories she shared about challenges of the British Army when the Imperial Japanese invaded Malaya and Singapore during WWII.

This is such a meaningful tour because it gives you a comprehensive background of how Singapore became what she is today. The influence from colonisation and war is deeply engraved in the roots of this country. Looking at the current Singapore, from being such a vulnerable place, to a strong and peaceful first world country, one can only feel proud of how resilient the people here are. Personally, I feel grateful and indebted to those who sacrificed during the war. We have much to learn from these brave men and women.

Tips for your visit: Apply mosquito repellent if you’re not used to the tropics. Bring a hat, and an umbrella (for the erratic hot and rainy weather), comfortable shoes.

It was used as an emergency, bomb-proof command centre during the Malayan Campaign and the Battle of Singapore. The Battlebox is definitely worth visiting if you are in Singapore. Note, however, that visits are by organised tour so tickets need booking. The tour is interesting for two principal reasons: 1) Entering the Battlebox provides a unique insight into the cramped and intense conditions the army operated under during the Battle of Singapore which, in the end, was won by the Japanese; but, 2) The tour itself is very interesting. Wan Jun conducted my tour and provided a detailed history of the strategic issues faced by the British in defending Singapore while Britain was already heavily engaged on the Eastern front. I would allow 90 mins for the tour and perhaps another 30-45 mins to explore Fort Canning itself, which provides peaceful, green surroundings and some old fort ruins.

Battlebox is easy to get to and sits near several MRT stations. I travelled to Dhoby Ghaut (CC1) but Bras Basah (CC2) and Fort Canning (DT20) are also close by. In fact, it is probably walkable from City Hall too.

I would suggest visiting the WC before arriving at the Battlebox, perhaps at the nearby Singapure shopping complex if you alight at Dhoby Ghaut, as there is no toilet at the Battlebox. The nearby ex-Pinacothèque de Paris building (unsure what it is called now) provides a single WC for gents, but was queued when I tried.",09-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 04:52:25.746288

Although I am actually not a war junkie, to understand the history of Singapore, you need to understand Singapore's involvement in WWII.

Ryan was our tour guide on the day I popped in and was able to pay the $18SGD to jump on the 4PM tour. I am so glad I did. Your ticket price helps take care of the Battle Box and you cannot step foot inside without a ticket and without going on a tour. The tour takes about an hour and 15 minutes. The Battle Box itself is directly behind the Fort Canning hotel. It is also located into Fort Canning Park, which is a lovely place to simply walk around, enjoy the greenery and take in the history of this area. The Battle Box is located within maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the Fort Canning MRT station, but do note that a good chunk of that walk is vertically up a hill or up stairs.

Ryan was an excellent guide. Not exactly jovial, but absolutely well versed in his docent skills and pays excellent attention to the historical details and information he is giving you. There is a lot of information to understand to understand the significance of the Battle Box and he really did a professional job in disseminating that information in a laid out manner that was easy to understand.

The tour itself involve walking down a set of stairs into the Battle Box, walking around the 20 or so rooms encased in this Fort Canning hill and some occasional stops to sit and view short videos. There are no restrooms down there for public use. The temperature is cool, for there is air conditioning. The space itself is very impressive and although there are replicas of furniture and stuff, the structure is very well maintained and preserved.

Along with the old Ford Factory museum, I found the Battle Box Museum and the tour to be absolutely excellent.",08-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 04:52:52.928344

Like the other reviewers suggested, generally speaking, the pacific side of war is less covered in the literature.

I was glad I found this tour, as it gave me an insight on the side of war that I never investigated into.

I recommend taking a walk here since the walk is beautiful. I also recommend arriving about ten minutes earlier because the tour starts on the dot.

The artifacts inside the bunker are well preserved. As an engineer, I was really interested in seeing the systems that ran this underground bunker.

It was also interesting to learn that this was the biggest capitulation (in numbers) by the British army in recorded history. I got to see Japan’s propaganda for the first time, too.

It truly was an amazing tour and our tour guide ""Chin"" was great. He was very informative and made the tour very interesting. I learnt alot from this tour so much that I went to visit the other war history site at the Old Ford Factory at Upper Bukit Timah Road. Which is another exhibition that recounts the events of the British surrender, and the Japanese occupation of Singapore. I was not aware of this being linked to what was happening at the Battle Box during that time. Truly Amazing.

They also have a small gift store which has some great books about Fort Canning and other sites.

Transport to Fort Canning to visit the BattleBox is very easy as there is now a ""Fort Canning MRT Station"" on the Blue line and from here its only a few minutes walk through the Fort Canning Park to get to the entrance. The park is a beautiful place to walk around, heaps of trees.

The Battlebox runs daily tours (I took the shorter of the two) and was suitably impressed by the guide, the interior of the bunker (incl. the statues, materials, videos etc.) and the overall experience. The bunker is also very well-kept and the air-conditioning is excellent - there were about 20+ participants and it never once felt stuffy.

My tour lasted slightly over an hour and during that time, I learned a lot of Singapore's history and in particular, the role and importance of the Battlebox (and Fort Canning). It was an eye-opener and made all the better by the very informative and pleasant guide. The tour itself was interesting as we explored several rooms within the Battlebox and saw depictions of what life must have been like for the British commanders and officers during the end of their rule in Singapore.

I would definitely recommend a visit to Fort Canning Park to anyone who has some interest in Singapore's history and its strategic importance (especially around World War II).

The hill was converted into a fort in 1860 and renamed Fort Canning in honour of Viscount Charles John Canning, Governor-General and first Vicerory of India. Around 1920s–1930s, the hill was transformed into an artillery fort with barracks, officers’ quarters, old gunpowder magazine and a hospital. An underground bunker called the Battle Box was also constructed during this time.

Key historic events also took place on Fort Canning Hill. Most notably, Lt-General Percival’s crucial decision to surrender to the Japanese was made in the Battle Box at Fort Canning Hill.",01-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 04:53:55.178553

Currently the only way to see this museum (the WW2 underground command centre of the British in Singapore) is via a tour although as I understand it, this might change in the future.
There was small group of us on the tour and our guide was the excellent ""Shar"", he had been in the Singapore army and his genuine insight and interest in the actions and decisions that led to the ""biggest surrender of British led forces"" was compelling. I knew little of what happened before this tour but a sort of ""British Pearl Harbor"" really was an eye opener and would certainly interest anyone with even a vague awareness of such matters.
Whilst still allowing plenty of opportunities for questions, ""Shar"" spoke quickly but it never felt rushed as we moved from room to room gradually gaining a greater understanding of what actually happened leading up to 'surrender'. In some rooms we watched short Pathe type videos in others we were shown real items of interest e.g. graffiti from service personnel of the time, many rooms also had ""Tussauds type models""; everything was fascinating.
My only regrets were not being allowed to take photos (although in a tour like this it was understandable) and not having sufficient time to read the plethora of display materials: still that does mean that there's a reason to go back when the museum 'opens up' more although it would be a shame to put ""Shar""out of a job!",11-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 04:54:12.140397

The Battle Box in Fort Canning Park is one of the most fascinating, professional, and poignant guided tours I have ever been on. Do not visit Singapore without seeing it. I was nearly in tears by the end.
Our guide Shural was ex-Singapore military, obviously enormously professionally and personally invested in telling the strategic story of Singapore's fall through the physical artifacts to hand in the Battlebox. He succeeded magnificently. A beautiful balance of detail and wider significance, setting Singapore's tragedy in the context of the second half of the war, unpacking the personal turmoil of the military commanders while describing the physical conditions of the bunker itself. This is what military history needs to be - so that our children, and their children, do not forget.

The guided tour takes you to the significant events from the start of the war until Singapore surrenders to the invading forces, which is roughly 2 months apart.

The tour is held right inside the underground command center where the Malaya Command monitored and directed the war efforts of the British, Australian, Indian, Singaporean and Malayan troops.
The command center is a bombproof bunker, previously not accessible by the public, which adds to the mystery surrounding the Battle Box.

The tour tells the story of how this command center functioned during the war. With a combination of walking tour (of different rooms with wax figures, mock up, photos, maps, diagrams), tour guide explanation and videos, you will definitely understand and somehow visualize much of the struggles that went on during that dark phase in Singapore history.

Price is not at all high for this type of tour - very engaging indeed. It's value for money. Plus, it was a huge help to be guided by a knowledgeable person - perfect know-how and delivery of explanation. She also made it interactive by asking questions and patiently waiting for replies from the tour participants. I learned much from the 1.5-hour tour; my time wasn't wasted.

Very informative guide took us through many rooms within the bunker under the Fort Canning hill, each room with its own story. 2 short videos are also presented giving the build-up to invasion by Japanese, and the ill-equipped allied navy and air force.
Hard to imagine how 300 to 400 men coped in these corridors 75 years ago.
My only criticisms are: The group size was a little too large so we could not always see the posters etc. the guide was pointing to. Most rooms have interesting artifacts or detailed descriptions of activities during the battles however we did not have enough time allocated to read anything.

It is a relatively new museum, located in an underground bunker compound in Fort Canning originally built as a British combined military command centre emergency shelter in case of war. It was deemed too small for its purpose, but shortly after the Japanese invasion of Singapore 500 personnel moved back into the bunker, including the commanders. The bunker was abandoned after the war and very few people remembered its existence as it was well hidden from view until it was rediscovered in 1988 by a curious journalist.

In this Battle Box the military commanders directed the war effort against the Japanese but ultimately had to make the fateful decision to surrender. It is this heartbreaking moment in time that is captured in the museum.

The tour lasts about 60 minutes as a guide takes you from room to room and expains the history through video and old pictures on the wall as well as props and wax figures of the commanders and other personnel.

Our guide Jerome (?) was excellent, well versed in history and well spoken. The underground bunker is cool compared to the oppressive heat and humidity outside. This tour may be a little too advanced for children under 6, and I suggest that you not take your small children as they might get bored and/or start crying which is very disruptive as we found out during our tour. Our guide had to escort a parent with a crying child outside, leaving us alone in one room for a few minutes. There are no bathroom facilities inside the bunker, and no benches or chairs to rest.

Right now the tours are led by a guide, and although there is talk about self-guided tours, it may take a while before this becomes reality.

Word has gotten out about this attraction, so either buy tickets in advance or be at the ticket office half an hour before the tour to ensure you get a ticket.",04-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 04:54:58.818218

Positives
- our tour guide Mel was great. Humorous, knowledgeable and unbiased in her sharing of information
- the tour has a great deal of history on display (not just the Battlebox history but also other important battles during WWII)
- learnt a lot more about the invasion of the Japanese and what really happened
- it was great to be able to walk around the bunkers and be in the rooms where the action took place.
- you can also walk around the other building on the site to give you a real sense of history
- the shop had a lot of different books and historical information that you could purchase

- the tour group was a little large and it was hard to see everything in the rooms because of this.
- on a Sunday the grounds on the site (not the museum) seem to attract a lot of groups of young people. They were drinking alcohol, smoking and playing loud music. A little disrespectful. There should be some policing of this.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 04:55:24.581300

Battlebox provides a closer perspective of what one aspect of life was like during that time - this time from the view of the commanders who decided to surrender Singapore to Japan. Right now (Feb 2017) you have to join a tour to be able to go in the bunkers, but there are plans later on to allow self-guided tours. I see the value though, in having a guide lead you through the place initially, as there are historical stories that I appreciate more when told in person, rather than from reading a description or listening to an audio guide. There are specific times for the tour, so it's best to check if they have slots for when you want to visit, as some days may be busy. I went on a weekend, and only the short tour was available. There is a longer tour that they do on weekdays.

It is in Fort Canning park, also a good place to visit to take a breather from urban Singapore. Battlebox is right next to Fort Canning Hotel, you get your tickets from the Battlebox Visitor Center.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 04:55:32.793143

When you arrive at Fort Canning head towards the Visitors' Centre. When you're facing The Centre turn towards your left hand side and keep walking!

It's well worth the visit when you eventually get there though. The exhibit is well thought out and is facilitated by a guide. It's so helpful to have the guide rather than just have headphones - it all adds to the atmosphere.

It will take you about 2 hours to get around the exhibit. It's quite a small space so perhaps not for the claustrophobic, though I was OK and it I suffer from it so.....

Once you've visited Battlebox make sure you have a nice walkaround Fort Canning and visit the old barracks and park. You can have a nice, cool drink at Fort Canning Hotel.

During each stop, he talked about the events leading up to the Japanese occupation of Singapore. The batch that I toured with was very engaged, and had some good questions for our guide, which he answered throughout the tour. The tour lasts 1 to 1.5 hours depending on the group's pace.

Other tips:
Photography is not allowed inside the bunker.
I would not recommend this tour for those travelling with young children or babies as they might get restless during the tour.
The Battlebox visitor center is situated a short walk from the Fort Canning exit of The National Museum of Singapore. You could visit the National Museum for a few hours, exit at its topmost level and walk up to Fort Canning Park in time for one of the afternoon tours.

Blending a smorgasbord of history, the timeless art of story-telling, combined with visual and audio treats, you descend 30 feet into the heart of a legendary hill which played a crucial part in the ill-fated battle of Singapore.
Discovered by accident not too long ago as workers were clearing up dense foliage on Fort Canning, the Battlebox served as an uber-bunker for the Allied command during the siege of Singapore by the advancing Japanese. Battles around the island were monitored from here and till this day you see reminders of the men that served within, ranging from ventilation slates crudely cut into the reinforced doors to graffiti in the toilets. Thankfully it is now fully-airconditioned and comfortable to walk around, a far cry from the sweltering, over-crowded days of its wartime usage.
I'm an avid follower of history, primarily military history and had visited the previous Battlebox which had since closed. When I read in the newspapers that the Battlebox has been revamped by a company known for its historical tours, I contacted them and attended one of their soft-launch tours.
While on the tour you will see the actual rooms defined by their use, historical artifacts and a movie clip with rarely seen footage. I have to say, the bunker itself is a sight to behold. Solid engineering for its time.
Physical attributes aside, the Battlebox tells an amazing story of Singapore's darkest hours. Led by experienced guides with interesting anecdotes along the way, they start the story at the entrance of the bunker and as you go deeper underground, room to room, the story too weaves its way with tales of tragedy and heroism. Such is the pull of a good story-teller and few places have them.
Even if history is not your thing, I highly recommend it to any tourist or local for half a day or even a full day visit; besides the Battlebox and its lovely visitor centre, there's Fort Canning and its historical grounds, a hotel beside it that was also a building of WW2 significance and a short walk away leads you to the other historical places and eateries in the Civic district
The tour ends back at the surface, where you come out of bomb-proof doors into the peaceful greenery of the park. By then you will be filled with a sense of awe and respect for what happened to our little island in 1942, and pray that war never comes to anyone or any country.",07-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 04:56:28.689558

Battle box suffers from all of these problems - there are only a few tours a day (not much demand though and it seems like you can show up a minute before the tour and get a ticket), it costs $18, the guide was slow and uninformed, the tour took twice as long as it needs to (some of the kids were just running around the place because they were so bored), and the displays are very limited, so it's more like a droning 1.5 hour stand-up lecture (with THREE films during the tour, only two of which you get to sit down for).

If they fixed the exhibits and allowed general entry, they might be able to create something as good as Churchill's War Rooms in London and really allow the history of the battle to be told properly.",05-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 04:56:37.931948

The guided tours last just over an hour, with the first tour starting at 9:45am. Adult ticket price of $18. The entire duration of the tour is in the underground bunker, so take note if you are not comfortable with confined spaces. Also, there is no cell phone reception in the bunker, which is quite fitting so you do appreciate when the guides describe the difficulties created by the poor communications between the bunker and the outside world during the war.

There are many interesting posters on the walls, but limited time to read all the posters while keeping up with the tour. Interesting to take note of the times on the clocks in the various rooms which are set to the times of the significant event that is being portrayed in the room. That the lives of so many soldiers and civilians were so irreparably changed by the decision of the few men in a bunker is a sobering thought.

Would have been interesting to have more information on how the bunker was built, or how the bunker received its supplies of water, fuel, etc... The tour only visits a few of the rooms in the bunker, maybe more rooms will be included when the tour officially opens in June 2016.

If interested to trace the steps following the decision to surrender, you can also visit The Ford Factory at Bukit Timah (site of the surrender).",04-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 04:56:45.921063

I took the longer of the two tours offered, the ""Guns, Graves, and Battles"" tour, which covers both the Battlebox and Fort Canning. It ran a little over 2.5 hours and was time well spent. My guide, Shar, was knowledgeable and kept us fully engaged, asking us questions. We didn't just listen to him tell us about what we were seeing, we also were asked what we thought about things, why we thought things happened, etc. He was also able to answer questions about history in Singapore and Malaysia and how it was all related to what we were seeing, which I considered really helpful in understanding the bigger picture. I got so much more out of this tour than many I've been on.

It was inconceivable to imagine so many soldiers cramped together in the dank, poorly ventilated accommodation.

As you go down into the Bunker its almost like going into a time warp and you can imagine that you are there back in 1942 making the desperate decision to surrender not knowing what will happen but feeling that there is no other option.The story is brought alive in a variety of ways; old footage of real events, wax figures, and genuine sights and even musty smells from the past. Its a sad story of mistakes and very human personality clashes that perhaps altered the true picture. But wouldn't those commanders be proud of what Singapore has become today?

Great for history buffs and people who want to understand what Singapore and the allied forces went through on the Pacific side of the war. I’ve done this tour at least 3 or 4 times and have brought many overseas friends and family to do it as it’s fabulous. They love it every single time. One comment though, children under 12 shouldn’t be allowed as they can be very distracting and disruptive. The walls of the bunkers are very echoey and any movement or noise really affects the quality of the experience. For visitors, I would advice to avoid groups with children if you have a choice as it could ruin your experience.",01-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 04:58:52.823909

I had booked tickets for the 2.45pm tour online. The instrucions to the venue on the website were easy to follow- we caught the MRT to Dhouby- Ghaut station and walked from there. The last part of the walk is up 4 flights of stairs. We did get there very early to collect our tickets ( they recommend 20 minutes) and were able to slot us into an earlier tour. On arrival I found that we were able to use our Singapore Explorer Pass to pay for the entry ( $18 adult).

You are not able to take photos inside- this may have been because it would slow down the tour group. The tour takes place underground and we were standing most of the time. The tour guides are very knowledgable and take the tour group through the area where the allied forces managed WW2 prior to the Fall of Singapore. Short video clips with historical original footage were interspersed with visits to different rooms within the Battlebox. This is a relatively new attraction and I believe it will only get better with more money invested in it.

* Pluses - Easy to book online. Air conditioned. Only takes an hour. Cheap at $18. Good reception area and little shop.
* Minuses - bathrooms are quite a schlep up the hill. Not easy in the heat though partially shaded. Rushed.

I self-toured this site 3 years ago at a fraction of the current price and learned almost as much useful information as you now get from a 45 minute tour. Honestly, the tour was too long. Now that there are more rooms open to view, I really fell they added over 20 minutes of unnecessary and often uninteresting information was added to the tour guide spiel just to fill in the additional time it takes to walk thru the bunker.

What my group all quickly picked up on the tour was the defensive tenor of the spiel, a continual verbal defense of General Percival’s decision to surrender Singapore. All main discussions led to ‘explanations’ of the surrender, over and over, as if the whole tour dialogue was written by his descendants trying to clear his name! The waste was that there was no reason for the excessive defense of Percival’s action and no blemish on the family to erase – the surrender was a logical decision by a honorable man that is unquestioned by history.

Despite the deficiencies of the new tour set up, the Fort Canning bunker site is worth the visit as one of the few solid pieces of the WWII history left in Singapore.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:00:21.005375

The tour 'A Story of Strategy and Surrender' led by Jerome was fantastic. Giving the visitor excellent insight into the creation of the bunker, the outbreak of the war, the key figures who worked within those walls and the outcome of surrender.

The tour flowed seamlessly, moving us through the bunker with visual aids, historic artifacts, mannequin displays and videos. Without the tour guide, Jerome, keeping us informed and entertained at every stop, even providing additional precise information for any questions asked, the Battlebox would not have become such a fond memory of my travels to Singapore.

We were not disappointed and found the tour very informative and learnt many important points about the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. The tour guide, Kamaliah, was very professional and knowledgeable and she explained that a new company had taken over the renovation and upkeep of the Battlebox in 2016.
We took the 'Story of Strategy and Surrender' tour and had the circumstances behind the Japanese invasion and subsequent surrender of Singapore by the British explained to us. There were many details that we were not aware of including the valiant defence of the vital NW coast of Singapore by the Australian 8th Division against the far superior Japanese forces led by the infamous General Yamashita.

As an amateur military historian I could not fault the guide (Hazeerah) who obviously knew her history. It was a little curious to hear a young Muslim woman consistently refer to the British Empire defenders as ""we"": ""we withdrew across the Causeway"", ""we were forced to surrender"" but it made it much more personal, as it was young people of her age - British, Australian, Indian, Malay and local Chinese volunteers - who did die and suffer.

There are a few stairs, but generally it is flat walking in a cool environment. I get the impression it is not on most tourists' itineraries, and whilst it is not a cultural show, it gives an essential insight into the history of Singapore.

The historical dialogue, videos and presentation of the wax figures in their original positions transported us back to the reality of the fall of Singapore. This is the best tour of its type we have experienced.",03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:01:35.426242

In the last weeks of World War 2 the Defence of Singapore was masterminded in this very bunker which has just been reopened to the public. The tour ( which runs 4 times a day) is a bit pricy at $18 but for slightly more than an hour you step back in time and get immersed into the tense atmosphere as British commanders unsuccessfully tried to defend Singapore and finally decided to surrender unconditionally. The guide was able to maintain interest and brought us through the dimly lit rooms explaining what each was used for and how it would have been 70 years ago... What it might have felt like and even smelt like. The reasons behind the surrender were well explained and I found it fascinating. Apart from the tour there is just a small shop on site with toilets and a cafe a few steps further into the park.,03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:01:41.231873
