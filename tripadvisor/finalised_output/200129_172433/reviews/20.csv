Its head represents Singapore’s original name, Singapura, or ‘lion city’ in Malay.

Merlion Park : Singapore landmark, a major tourist attraction and a super hit picture on almost all the magnets and souvenirs found in Singapore is Merlion Park. It depicts a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish. It’s wide courtyard just like the Manhattan’s courtyard near the river where almost everyone including me get their picture clicked with there hands folded, begging for the water to fall from its wide open mouth on once hand is really a nice place to be when you are in Singapore.

Of course, you have to visit this place when you go to Singapore since this is one of your tour/trip's highlight. No entrance fee required. Wear a cap/hat/bandana, sunglass, and put sunblock lotion since Mr. Sunshine or Mr. Rain will unexpectedly say hello once in a while.

It is a bit crowded, but it is natural to expect a crowd, for it offers a very good photo opportunity. People take photos, cupping their hands together and making it appear in the photos that the water is falling straight into the cupped hands.

The place is known as The Merlion Park and is quite popular among the visitors; in fact, visit to Singapore is incomplete without posing for a picture with the Merlion in the background. Tourist throng to this park and get themselves clicked, especially in trick poses, from the viewing deck in front of the statue – it appears in the picture as if the spouted water is falling straight into one’s open mouth.

We too had clicked many such happy pictures, tricked ones and otherwise, with Merlion, and also with three-towered Marina Bay Sands Hotel and the cityscape in the background. The park also offers boat-ride over the Singapore river and also houses several high-end restaurants and eateries to dine-in.

Its name combines ""mer"", meaning the sea, and ""lion"". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means ""sea town"" in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name—Singapura—meaning ""lion city"" or ""kota singa"".

The Merlion Park is one than a sculpture of the Merlion which in itself is magnificent and iconic. Take the time to enjoy the surrounding views as well especially Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands right across. These views are especially breath taking at night with the Merlion elegantly lighted up. Think about this, just a little over 4 decades ago, when the Merlion was erected, there was no Marina Bay as it exists today, no tall skyscrapers behind, where Marina Bay Sands now stand was just reclaimed land. The Merlion would be proud of the progress it sees over time which is now made available for all to enjoy.

If you can spend an afternoon to an evening at Marina Bay, start at the Helix Bridge and walk towards Marina Bay Sands, then keep walking all the way to the Merlion Park, it will be one of the most unforgettable and enjoyable strolls you will ever have.

Also visit it in the twilight from where you can get a boat ride for around 25 SGD and visit the entire sights of Singapore as evening settles and day changes to night to get so many wonderful images.

It symbolizes Singapore's humble start as a fishing town while also representing the country's original name, Singapura, which in Malay means lion city.
The park is not big with nothing much to see and is often crowded with people wanting to take photos of Merlion. There's however a lovely view of the bay with boats passing by and the unique looking Marina Bay Sands hotel across.
It's nice to walk around. You can cross the pedestrian bridge towards the Esplanade Theatre where you can watch shows, relax on the open platform by the bay, eat at the restaurants or hawkers foodcourt nearby (Makan Sutra).
You can also cross the street towards the Fullerton Hotel, walk on the historic Cavenagh Bridge to the Asian Civilisation Museum or take a boat around the Singapore River or to Clarke Quay for dinner.

As we had other plans after taking lots of pictures with the Merlion we walked to the other side via Jubilee bridge and walked on the path to Helix bridge which connects to the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre.

The coconut ice cream is great, you will see a stall on the way. They put a scoop of coconut ice cream in half a coconut shell and also offer a free glass of coconut water.

After a little walk you'll get to the helix bridge where you can enjoy ice cream sandwiches made at the spot by an old man. It's quite famous and yummy. You have great views from the helix bridge; you'll be able to see a lotus shaped building which is the science museum, marina bay sands building, Merlion, the financial hub.

My sister and I took a tour package from the airport for like $85 each, (it comes with the city tour, boat ride and the Singapore zoo entrance ticket as well, and a train card each) not knowing that its a walking tour, I was just shocked,coz we're a bit tired of walking, coming from our place to go anywhere, bus here, and ride a train then transfer to another and another train again (and I've never try to have a walking tour :) ) And every place we go, the tour guide will just give us 10 mins to take picture and then move to another destination! So yeah, 10 minutes won't be enough for you not just to take pictures but to appreciate and roam around a bit on that certain place. and the thing is, its hard to find room to have a picture in front of the Merlion! it took us around 5 mins to get a good spot! ''long queue'' seriously! :) and there was an old man (his Chinese) while my sister is taking my photo he just get near of me and touch my arm and tell me to move! because he wants to take lots of photos again! (knowing we waited for them to finished first) and my camera is a Polaroid what a waste of film!, he did it like thrice :) but we just ignored him and then leave! We need to hurry coz we we're the only missing from our group and proceed to the boat ride! and that's he best part of the tour!
The Tour Guide is really nice tho,

But yeah, I suggest if you'll come to SG just search where you wanna go! Coz as I said, its a small country so, and all the train stations are connected and usually downstairs there'll be a bus station, you just need to check the number, coz each number travels different ways, and yeah, before I forget better visit SG on 2020 coz when we went there last June (2016) and there are a lot of road works there, and he said that those road workers are planned to be tunnels, for train, coz the gov't. wants to make a train that would bring their people home in just 7 mins, in other words they'll have train station near their houses. Amazing aye?! Hope we can go there again! So we can see the difference
All in all, it was really nice experience, but I think, its kinda pricey there, but my sister and I are good with budgeting our money, so yeah, we usually eat in the food stands in train station to save money! For just like $2.5-$4 each we got rice and dish already its yummy and healthy! and we're full! Rather than eating in fast foods and restos which is way expensive!

if you stay at the Fairmont hotel or swissHotel Stamford, Rafles or other of the multitude of Hotels in singapore then the merlion is pretty well within walking distance either over land or past the multitude of underground shopping enroute to the MRT [mass rapid transit] system. [read train].
the Merlion park is always crowded. I ahve been there a couple of times now and other than very late at night or early in the morning it alwasy has people and cameras. Include merlion Park on your walk around the Boardwalk cirumnavigation of the singapore river mouth (bay?). the distance is about 4 k and takes about an hour. stopping at the Merlion, the Helix bridge and the Marina Bay Shopping complex makes the trip take a bit longer and providies points of interest to make the walk worthwhile.

I was pleasantly surprised when we got there to see that they do NOT charge entrance fees. And that the best way to reach Merlion Park is through a cab (especially if you're traveling with your family/children).

Check out the weather should you wish to visit there. It is always best to be there on a perfect hot weather.

""The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means ""sea town"" in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name—Singapura—meaning ""lion city"" or ""kota singa"".""

When we got to the Park, the giant statute was under wraps for renovation. Still the area and view of the bay is nice. Plenty of tourist were taking photos of the small statute. We waited five minutes for our turn to do the same and had a nice walk along the shore looking for the bus to take us to our next stop.",03-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 01:49:15.162062

Others describe it in detail, so I’m concentrating on the problems I faced.
Took a bus to Fullerton Square, that was the easy bit. Now we had to cross the road. There’s an underpass from the Fullerton, but there’s no elevator for the disabled, just escalators. We walked some distance to find a suitable surface road crossing. 2 sets of traffic lights, so it took some time.
Now we were faced with flights of steps to get to the viewing area. My wife found, after a goodly walk, one smaller flight of steps, with a wheelchair lift (you have to phone to get the staff to help). In the end, we had to walk half across the river and back again on a different bridge to avoid steps.
By now we needed the toilet. Full marks, there are two disabled toilets, but oh dear they’re not suitable for many disabled people, because there are no handrails around the toilet.
Things were worse than normal when we visited, because there were a lot of ramps to get over power leads for the New Year Display. At least that’s only temporary.
The final problem is the many tourists walking around not watching where they are, looking for that perfect picture. It just made things more difficult.
Be alert for some steps which are very difficult to spot. No warnings bumps in the pavement for the blind, and no obvious yellow paint to show the edges.
If you’re disabled, there are so many good places to visit in Singapore, I think it’s best to give this one a miss. See the Merlion from across the river, or from other places around the Marina.",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 01:49:39.648463

I am sure you have heard of centaurs, unicorns, dragons and even phoenixes before. In Singapore, we have our very own mythical creature too and it's none other than the Merlion!

Born with the head of a lion and the body of a mermaid (don't ask me how that happened, we're still trying to figure that out), the Merlion is the tourism ambassador of Singapore. The official Merlion can be found at the centre of the city-state, between the Marina Bay tourist area.

It guards the entrance to the Singapore river, overlooking popular tourist destinations like the Marina Bay Sands, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer and is within a short walk away from the Fullerton Hotel and the National Gallery Singapore.

The Merlion enjoys spewing water out from its mouth most of the day, for reasons we are also still unsure of. Maybe it's because of all the partying nights. Legends say that in the night, the Merlion will quietly slip to Clarke Quay, Singapore's premier clubbing and drinking district to wind down after a tough day of being a tourist attraction.

Clarke Quay is also not that far too, only around 1-kilometre walk along the river.

Jokes aside, if you are considering to visit the Merlion, bear in mind that it's only a statue overlooking the Marina Bay area. There are some cafes nearby for you to sit down and enjoy the view, or you can choose to sit near the steps of the Merlion, but there's not much else to do here other than to take photos and enjoy the view.

If you fully want to enjoy the Marina Bay experience and see the Merlion from a different angle, I suggest taking the river cruise that allows you to tour the different landmarks along Singapore River. If I remember correctly, you can also embark and disembark at different pickup points. But check with the counter first.

Or if you're feeling adventurous and don't mind a little walking, you can choose to walk along the bay area and visit several landmarks at one go. There's the Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, the Art Science Museum and Marina Bay Sands all within walking distance. Might take you half a day to one full day to cover everything.

Singapore's weather can get quite hot or rainy so bring an umbrella just in case.",10-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 01:50:16.625964

Certainly we wanted to see other parts of the city, but this was one I couldn’t miss... or so I thought.

I can’t tell you what I was expecting, but I can say that I was disappointed. It’s a very crowded waterfront park with a large cement sculpture spitting water. The sculpture isn’t overly detailed or that impressive. There’s no information about what it represents or why it’s ever there. The one nice feature is that there’s a slightly nicer, smaller version of the sculpture behind the large Merlion that’s worth seeing.

The park is very popular with tourists and with crowds of people trying to photos with this statue. You can also see the Merlion by taking one of the boat tours of which the main pier/booking office is only situated about 50 metres away. We were fortunate to do both and got some great photos.

Merlion can be seen spouting water from its location in a park that bears its name. This mythical statue’s body is said to symbolize Singapore’s beginnings as a fishing village and the head represents Singapore’s original name “lion city”. Originally, the statue was located at the mouth of the Singapore River but it was moved to its present location in 2002 to allow it to be viewed from the waterfront away from the bridge that was blocking the view. It was created in the 1990’s around the time Singapore was not longer a British colony. Merlion is a “must see”",11-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 01:52:34.241894

However, it was whilst peering over the edge of the Infinity Pool of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel that we spotted it.

So we resolved to go see it prior to heading to the airport on our final day in Singapore.

Unfortunately, on that final day, it was CHUCKING it down with rain. It was a good few hours (spent wholly at The Shoppes shopping centre at Marina Bay Sands) before the rain died down enough for us to venture out.

We crossed the Helix Bridge (arguably an attraction in it's own right - if you're into bridges and architecture), which took us by various other sights such as The Float (world's largest floating stadium and stage), The Bay Grandstand, The Esplanade Outdoor Theatre, The Waterfront Promenade, and the Esplanade Bridge, before we reached the Merlion situated in Merlion Park.

Now, I've read reviews of how busy the place it, however, we went around lunchtime on a Tuesday, and it wasn't nearly as rammed as I've been led to believe that it could get. We easily took our pictures of and with the Merlion, and helped others take theirs without much bother.

Was it worth waiting out the rain to visit? I want to an emphatic ""yes"", but I can't. I can't say that its worth spending a great day of time or effort to get to, but that said, I am glad that we went, if only to tick something off our list.

The park itself is quite nice, and you can see some stunning views, but after visiting something like The Garden by the Bay, most other park type areas pale in comparison.",11-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 01:53:10.286413

What? You don't know the legend of the lion? Ok, no problem, here it is: ""In the 14th century, the prince of Sumatra of the hindu Kingdom Sri Vjaya married the princess of the buddhist Kingdom of Mjapahir. Later on he got in trouble because of it and had to flee from Sumatra to Temasek (the city at the sea). On his way, he met a lion in the jungle. He was scared and he was ready to fight him, but after a while staring at themselves, they saw themselves at equal, turned around and passed each other. The prince was so fascinated of that encounter, he decided to rename the city of Temasek to Singapore (Singha = Lion; pura = city). From that moment onwards the landmark of Singapore was the ""Merlion"", half lion because of his strength and half mermaid to show the closeness to the sea. The mistake in that story would be that at this time there were no lions in this area, so it probably was a tiger!""",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 01:55:42.760415

The best part is it's free to go look and take as many photos as you like from the viewing areas.

I will say that there were only a few times we went past that there weren't hoards of tourists there so getting the perfect photo is a challenge.

We also went right by the large Merlion on the night time river cruise. We got to see the Merlion from a different perspective and seeing as we caught a late boat about 9:15pm, there were only a few people onboard. The boat cruise is a paid activity 25$S per person I believe and some counters are cash only.

We got to Merlion Park on bus #10 which stopped just up from the statue, on the esplanade, it was just a short walk from there, but there are several ways to get there via public transport.

The park, or should I say esplanade, rather than a real park, stretches along the waterfront opposite the Marina and is a pleasant hour or so of walking slowly to gather in the whole thing. There are great views of the harbour and the city skyline from the other side towards the F1 pit straight.

The restaurants and bars along the walk are overpriced; don't bother paying $20 for a beer there when you can get one for $8 less than ten minutes away - that is just stupid. Other than that, the walkway was rather pleasant on an afternoon and provided a surprisingly calming trip. The Merlion area itself is obviously a lot busier, but stepping away from the viewing platform and down towards the water offers a different viewpoint that most seem to ignore.

Once you take your photo, don't plan on spending more than 5 minutes to take in the views or your patience will be sorely tested.

The Merlion itself is just a device invented by the Singapore tourist board, don't expect any historic value to be obtained by this park. The Merloin is a recognisable feature on many postcards and t-shirts, hence the keen interest from tourists.

Try and get to this free feature as early as possible (and I mean early) so as to avoid the bus loads of excitable tourists arrive for their 15 minute panic indused stop off.

Half-fish and half-lion, the creature is meant to represent Singapore's national spirit, its roots as a fishing village and its designation as ""lion city"" (Singapura). The current statue was unveiled in 1972 by the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and currently it sits in the Merlion Park, on a promontory in front of The Fullerton Hotel and near the mouth of the Singapore River. There is a viewing platform from where you can see the statue. Since this is the most recognized symbol of Singapore we were prepared for crowds.

As a local, I dont hunt for merlion and somehow this is my first time I purposely find merlion because I go with my foreign friend for photo taking.

Frankly I'm out of words. The scene I see is like all tourists must come to this place if you say you come to Singapore before. Because this kind of scene I see it when I go overseas and I saw many tourists busy taking photos happily to capture the iconic symbol of the country.

Somehow I really like the atmosphere and the Merlion was huge. It is really beautiful spot at the sea and there are nice scenery nearby. I enjoy taking alot photos at Merlion and taking interesting photo spot of holding the water from the merlion.

You will really like here if you enjoy photo-taking. If you are not into photo-taking, maybe this may not be what you like. Because almost all tourist here are taking out their camera and snapping beautiful shots.

Seeing is believing. Hope you all enjoy the trip here.

Set right on the waterfront, this little showcase is a must see when visiting, and this was only my second trip to it since I first saw it way back in November of 2009.

However, this time, I got wonderful night shots (and with a much better camera than the last time).

This installation is cool to see too, because the downtown area of the city creates and awesome backdrop (although I think I'd say it looks cooler at just before sundown with just enough light in the sky plus the statue, plus the lights from the buildings in the background).

However, as previously mentioned by many others, yes, as this IS probably the most emblematic landmark in the country, it's going to attract quite a crowd and thus, there will most likely be many many people there all taking their selfies and group pictures in both the day or night.
However, it's not like you can't get good pictures in between as most were very considerate of others who are also trying to get their own memorable snapshots.

Also, if one gets off at the City Hall MRT, follow maps, and even street signs, you can easily reach the Merlion, is a great place for a photo shoot and admission is completely free!

The big Merlion; named Mama Merlion, is the original one which stood on the waterfront (before the big land reclamation project), standing behind her is The Cub (a female, they say) and the only Merlion facing away from the sea. This is a fun place to take photos, and there are plentiful near-by places where you can get a cool drink.
In reply to the Trip Advisor questions about fees and dress standard: there are no fees to pay at any Merlion venue. Common sense dictates that you dress reasonably wherever you go in Singapore... the locals don't particularly want to see visitors in grubby / skimpy outfits.
What next?! Now that you've met Mama Merlion and The Cub, you should walk up to the top of Mt Faber to meet Elder Brother Merlion... and of course you'll take a trip to Sentosa Island; the ideal opportunity to meet one more member of the family; Papa Merlion.
There's another, rather diminutive, Merlion at the Tourist Info Centre.
If you have an inquiring mind, you can do the research on the computer and find two unofficial Merlions guarding the carpark at Ang Mo Kio Grove, and three unofficial Merlions in Woodlands; two are in front of a garden shop / plant nursery, where you can meet the gent who created them! And one more just around the corner in a sort of Merlion shrine.

It seems that everybody who visits Singapore ends up with a least one photo of the Merlion. Located at Merlion Park on Marina Bay, in front of the Fullerton Hotel, there is a pier extending alongside allowing you to take photos of it from all angles. There tends to be a crowd no matter what time during the day that you visit. If you take a bumboat tour you can even take photos of it from the water.

Nearest MRT station is Raffles Place, however it can be hard to find your way if you are first time in Singapore, so I recommend to check from map beforehand, and maybe upload offline map :)

The Merlion statue has an open mouth spewing out water from its mouth like a fountain into the lake surrounding it. The statue is facing the water on the lake, and the area is surrounded with many tall buildings . The Marina Bay Sands hotel complex, stands out among the tall buildings & I was able to take a photo with the Merlion statue & the Marina Bay Sands hotel on the background.

Sure enough, it was the first on my list of things to see when I landed in this country. Easily accessible by public transportation (I cannot stress enough about how easy it was to travel here and how well-connected the buses in Singapore are. You might have to change 2-3 buses depending on where you are staying, but it's worth it. I was blown away!)

You can view the Esplanade, the Flyer, the ArtScience Museum and Marina Bay Sands from here and it is an amazing photo op!
(Tip: try to take a photo of the Merlion Park from the other side, i.e., from either the top of the Singapore Flyer or the roof of Marina Bay Sands. You can look at other humans flitting about like little ants!)

The only downside I can think of is that the place is going to be crowded no matter what time you go. But do not miss this one for anything.

P.S: Just make sure you carry an umbrella or a raincoat with you. The weather here is unpredictable and the unexpected showers drenched us thoroughly.

There are some great view points in front and around the side of the symbol. There are loads and loads of tourists all wanting the same photo you want too. It works out ok if you are patient, you can always get your favorite shot.

The Park is easy to get to walking or by other transpo, to me it was fun to explore that whole area, including the nearby very well noted hotels. I also tied this visit with a trip to tour the Singapore River, there is a river tour stop within 100 meters of Merlion.

One of the most popular area of Singapore where tourists gather abundantly. One can have very definite and clear view of Singapore skyline from here as it is surrounded with skyscrapers. Merlion symbolizes Singapore. It is easily visible from almost any place at Marina Bay area. More nicely it is cost free attraction. From here very significant attractions and monuments like Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer, Water floating stadium, big Lotus and Durian structure are so nicely visible. So this is a very good spot for taking photographs. In Sentosa Island there is another Merlion which is huge in size. There is a small park surrounding the statue. Water squirts from its mouth to the river at a commendable volume and speed. Color of the statue and squirting water are changed after dusk. So it is recommended to visit there both at day and night time to have different feelings.

Merlion is the iconic symbol and mascot of Singapore & the country and is located at the Marina Bay across the street from the Fullerton Hotel. This is one of THE most popular sites in Singapore that everyone wants a photo & selfie with so expect crowds day or night! Merlion I was told is a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish. You will see it on all travel brochures and advertisements.

BOTTOM LINE: No trip to Singapore is complete without a visit here. The amount of water coming out of Merlion's mouth is like a large high pressure fire-hose. Depending on the wind direction, you might get wet! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! MY RATION: 10/10.

This location is also excellent for taking photos of the Marina Sands Hotel and the skyline. A zoom lens is helpful. Parking is limited close by the park. Taxis can drop you off and come back in 10 minutes or so. A must stop to get a photo here!",03-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 02:13:15.851324

The fountain statue though represents the symbol of Singapore, the Merlion, combining the ties between the island and its people to the sea, as well as the historic name the ""Lion city"" in malayan that is ironically the old name given to a place where lions never existed!
This Merlion was allocated in the mouth of the Singapore river but it was relocated here in 2002 and it sprays the water right back to the bay
As usual in Singapore, you better visit by night to enjoy the lights and the atmosphere and definitely this place is on your way while visiting the Marina Bay, and for sure it is a great idea to get some photos with the fountain in the background sending its water right over your head or directly in your mouth ;)",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 02:14:01.021939

For dining options, you may find PS Cafe a suitable choice for lunch and dinner too. There is a few Starbucks outlets near Merlion Park - one at Waterboat House and another near The Fullerton Bay.

It is also the closest where you get to the Merlion. Instagram worthy but also rather crowded. Light shows on the bay every night - a bit touristy but they love it nonetheless.

I usually take them for dinner at Palm beach Seafood restaurant to enjoy chili crab and pretty good food. A bit more pricey than usual but food is good and it has a great view outside. It’s usually packed. so book in advance to sit outside to enjoy the view.

In the day, nice place to enjoy beer, coffee etc at the many al fresco cafes and take in all the activities in the bay - sports, river boat cruise etc. If it gets too warm or too wet, sit inside the air-conditioned areas. I like the Ps Cafe on Level 2. To get there, take a cab to One Fullerton or walk from the nearest train station or bus stop. It’s also a nice walk from the Marina Bay Shoppes (where the hotel is) to One Fullerton (just follow the Merlin spouting water at the opposite end) - a scenic 15 minute walk.

From One Fullerton you can also take the basement travellator to the Fullerton Hotel - which used to be the General post office, a relic left from the British which was conserved and converted to a spectacular hotel. Around that district, wander around and you find more conserved properties beautifully restored and maintained which are now museums, concert halls and galleries. Bring along a bottle of water and a small towel and wear comfortable shoes. It is hot and humid over in Singapore.",05-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 02:14:28.651085

In the night, you will see a variety of beautiful colourful Merlion depicting various Singapore Places Of interest in the form of light rays shining on the Beautiful Merlion.

first we saw this half fish half lion mythical creature by the river from the boat trip we took at night . Made a mental note to walk back to it after the tour . Which we did . We walked from Clarke Quay to Merlion.... It was too busy even late at night so don't expect a photo alone with it . It's fun and entertaining to watch people trying to get a good shot of themselves trying to pretend drink from the fountain... We did the same and it was a very cool shot actually....
You're in Singapore and this is the city's symbol so you should come and take a few photos at least . There are some beautiful places to drink / eat nearby . The walk from the Clarke Quay was a lovely one too ... As it was a Saturday night it was heaving ....
