More than that, it also does great in portraying the life and culture of everyday Singaporeans. Until Mar 2020, they are also having ‘An Old New World’ exhibition covering the 700 years of history leading up to Britain’s discovery.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 19:27:48.938830

The first display was a sinuous curve of very detailed text about the trades unions and their part in independence - I tried, but it was far too much to read. We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.

The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.

Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem! We were only in Singapore for a few days, but it was worth seeing the dome from the inside first and then seeing the façade from the road last. Truly a treasure worth maintaining but it struggles to compete on the world stage of national museums.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-29 19:27:51.964219

The museum is beautifully laid out and presented - some really interesting exhibits and just enough information. The exhibitions are all good - on the first floor the exhibition dealing with the history of Singapore is probably the main one and definitely worth visiting, taking you from the 12c ? through the main different cultures that make up Singapore, through the 2WW with some very interesting artefacts if not gruesome reminders and then on to independence and the subsequent growth of Singapore into where it is today.

The current theme is very suitable for kids (just curious).

My girls aged 8 and 10 loved all the 4 themes. They had fun with the gigantic puzzles, weighing the anchor, fixing back the vases and of course the bouncy castle and interactive in the Stories of Forest. I forgot to mentioned they loved drawing and colouring their toy and get to play some of the traditional games.

I have also bought the interactive guidebook which they enjoyed working on it and reading it whenever they saw the artefact in the permanent gallery. We have not finished with the entire book in the musuem and do intent to visit the musuem once again to finish up the remaining activies.

Was very pleased to find that the history of Singapore had additional and interesting information on the surrender of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Even more gratified to find the presentation of facts objective and non-controversial, very fair to all parties and countries involved, but details certainly giving rise to individual responses eg presentation of the Tiger of Malaya, General Yamashita, his trial and execution, the Sook Ching Massacre, Lee Kuan Yew's arguments for merger with Malaysia. There was a very good docent guiding at 11am and while not part of the group, overheard her insightful and humorous commentary which was much appreciated by the visitors.
Found the temporary exhibition on 'Packaging' nostalgic, and the items, eg F n N bottles, posters well-sourced and preserved. Also enjoyed again the Enchanted Forest with the digitalized walk imaginatively put together with lovable small creatures, colorful flora and even tropical rain and melodic sounds.
However, it's rather confusing finding your way around and the restrooms' signage is incredibly difficult to identify especially as the one near the entrance has been usurped by ' Food for Thought' , this food outlet looking rather uninviting with over-priced Western fare.

,1,12,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/dheersanghi13,667512893,19-04-2019,5,"National Museum of Singapore - Magic and Menace Gallery, Glass Rotunda exhibition, and 700 Years of Singapore History","With a history dating back to its inception in 1887, the National Museum of Singapore is the nation’s oldest and biggest museum. The famous big rotunda with a stunning dome is just a part of the great architecture that makes the building so special. Located on the bustling Orchard Road, this museum is right at the center of Singapore. NMS is designed like a British colonial building, as it was built for Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee.

I visited 2 tours with an FOM docent during my time at the National Museum. The first one was a gallery called Magic and Menace. This gallery contained watercolor paintings that were commissioned by Singapore’s first British Resident, William Farquhar. He was so amazed at the tropical landscape, that he commissioned Chinese artists to draw/paint the flora and fauna of the Malay archipelago. There are also tribal tools, products, and artifacts, even dead animals, from Farquhar’s collection. The reason the gallery is named “Magic and Menace”, is because of the supernatural beliefs of the locals at that time. They believed in spirits, especially in animals and plants. So, depending on whether there were good or evil spirits, they could create magic or be a menace! Another interesting feature of this gallery were the “smell jars” in which you could smell Jasmine, Durian, Nutmeg, and the Yellow Champaka flower. This made the tour a multi-sensory discovery experience of the religions, customs, and cultures of the local Malays in the 1800s.

We continued on into another mesmerizing experience titled “Story of the Forest”. Sixty-nine of Farquhar’s paintings have been converted into a large, 3D digital panorama, creating a view of the Jungles of Melaka. The lifelikeness of the displays is complete with animation, music, and sound, and invites you to interact with the wildlife of the Malay peninsula in the 19th century up close.

The second tour on “The 700 Year History Of Singapore” was about the journey of Singapore to get where it is today. As our docent said, “Most Singaporeans think their history is 200 years old, but in actuality, they will be surprised as to how long the formation of Singapore has taken”.

This tour takes us through four distinct periods in Singapore’s life: Singapura (1299 – 1818), Crown Colony (1819 – 1941), Syonan-To (1942 – 1945), and Singapore (1945 – present). From being a sleepy fishing town to a British colony to part of the Japanese Pacific expansion, to finally getting freedom, the tour highlights the culture, trade, political situation at each stage. It tells you what it means to be a Singaporean, and Singapore’s national identity. Complete with life-sized models, this tour is completely immersive and takes you right to the nation’s defining moments in history. We were told that “nothing in Singapore’s history happened by chance; every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.”

The NMS is a museum central to Singapore and is custodian of the 11 National Treasures. It is supported by a wide range of facilities and services including F&B, retail, and a Resource Centre. A cultural and architectural landmark in Singapore, the Museum hosts festivals and events all year round—the Night Festival, performances and film screenings, and more—in addition to presenting interesting exhibitions involving important collections of artifacts. This museum is one you shouldn’t miss!

Some interesting quotes by the tour guides:

“Nothing in Singapore’s history happened by chance, and every move was thought out and well planned. That is how Singapore came to where it is today.”

“Through the eye of William Farquhar, we are able to see the beauty of Melaka and the Malay Peninsula, geographically, and biologically.”",04-2019,Family,2020-01-29 19:28:07.091079

The museum is housed in a beautiful building - and reminds you of the colonial splendor of British architecture.. It is the oldest museum in Singapore and dates back to 1887.

It is open daily from 10am to 7pm - and the last admission is at 6.15pm. I enjoyed the Story of the Forest. It was a clever technological display that has to be seen to be believed - as it transforms drawings into 3D animation.

There are other exhibitions about Singapore's past - the Japanese occupation was interesting.

Every last Saturday of the month - there are ""family time"" activities.

I spent half a day in this museum - and still felt that i could go round again.

However the reason why doesn't get 5 stars is that, permanent residents get in for free here and unlike London where most of the museum's are free - surely this would benefit Singapore more greatly as tourists would learn about the country's history.
Another point is that the museum has discretely side tracked a important part of start of the country's history in that the outbreaks of the racial riots in 1964 were some of the important contributing factors which led to the eventual separation of Singapore from the Malayan, paving the way for Singapore’s independence in June 1965.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-29 19:29:21.227538

We had a one hour tour with an English speaking guide who was very good even though English was her second language. There was a very large group of children visiting the museum which made hearing the guide very difficult but she did try her best. If you have a few hours and want to get out of the heat this is a good place to visit.,02-2017,Family,2020-01-29 19:29:55.607573

I must say, I was proven wrong. The museum was much better than expected.

The museum sits in a quiet corner in between the central business and shopping districts next to our Singapore Management University. The rustic building brings a sense of nostalgic feeling and stands out among the more modern buildings surrounding it.

Going into the museum takes you to a world different from the hustle and bustle of the city around it. I do applaud the wonderfully informative exhibits on Singapore's history and our road to being a developed nation. There is a mix of audio, video and displays which will keep you relatively entertained for a good 90 to 120mins.

I especially like (and this is for all locals), the new exhibit on our ""modern founding father"", the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. It may have been a year but it still touches a chord and you get to see actual artifacts (clothes, bicycle, the famous red briefcase) of Mr Lee's life.

And as you would expect from the Singaporean customer service standards, the staff of the museum are friendly and helpful.

I came across such facts and many more in our 4 hours of visit to National Museum.

How to get there: We took Red line mrt. Got down at Dhoby Ghat and took Exit A. It is 5 minutes walk to National museum from mrt.

Tickets: We bought tickets from there, 10 SGD/ per head. Not required for kids below 3. Free for PR/ Singaporeans.

As we entered the building, architectural marvel welcomed us. As we walked further, we passed through a souvenir shop. On the left was a cafe but he head straight to the gallery at level 1. At the start are some rocks dating back few centuries, big wooden ship, some earthen vessels, jewellery and a wall playing a video.

As we proceeded further, things became far more interesting. There are various information boards, pictures, paintings. It starts when the land was Singapora to Crown Jewel (of British) to Syonan To (Japanese rule), Independence, merger with Malaysia, separation and a new identity.

The whole museum is amazing conceptualized and built. If somebody want to know how a nation is built from nothing to a great developed and powerful one within a generation - this is the story. Study everything, absorb and understand.

You will come out as an enriched person known much more about history, people, culture. Post separation with Malaysia and the way LKY (there is a 7 minutes video on a big screen) lead the country is only to be admired and learnt from.

Museum is blend of keeping things old rustic and at the same time embracing technology and modern depictions when time move to present one. Historical events are unfolded via pictures and few animations.

At one section in level 2, it is amazing to see how the evolution in society happened. How films were promoted, when theatres were built. They also have clothes and cutlery on display. Family values, example there were campaigns like 'Girl or Boy, two are enough' OR 'Second can wait' OR 'Teenage marriage means pushing into problems - depicting a young couple with two kids and a messy house; in 1970s. I found these fascinating. This tells what the society went through and how government played great role in building a mature society.

There are many more interesting stories to absorb here in the museum. You should have 6+ hours if you have great interest in knowing Singapore's history.

As for kids go, there is nothing much to offer. Our 3 years old son enjoyed at the begining but after 2 hours, he was kind of bored. Though we kept his interests alive by showing new new things, like range of camera, fighter tanks, clothes, etc that were on display.

You can take some really nice pics of yours at Level 2 with sun falling directly on you from the glass ceiling with amazing architectural walls and windows. Overall, we had an enriching time and it was worth a visit.

If you are a tourist with handful of days in hand to roam around, you may keep this at a lower priority. This is for those who enjoy and appreciate history, wants to know about Singapore and has ample patience.",09-2016,Family,2020-01-29 19:30:23.471620

I'm just going to share two examples from my visit: 1) The Social Table. At the National Gallery, before entering any of the art exhibits, I stood at a large table with moving photos of various art works in the collection. It was a wonderful way to preview and familiarize yourself with the displayed originals. You could touch the screen and learn all about the piece, the artist, the school. . . It made viewing the gallery a personal experience. I'd turn a corner or enter a new room and immediately recognize one of ""my"" pieces.
But that's not all.
Also at the social table, you could tag the works you liked. For example, I started a file on Women in Singaporean Art. With a simple touch, I saved images in my folder. AND THEN I was able to open my folder and CREATE a poster of the works I selected. THIS I emailed to myself.
2) Children's art. This interactive feature was in the Children's section of the Museum. Titled ""Who's in the Woods?"" it invited children to design and them bring to life an animal. I went with four year-old Lauren who was perfectly able to design her elephant.
Once Lauren was happy with her creation, she could send it to live in the woods. It would appear on the enormous screen, walking, sitting, and interacting with other animals. I loved this. So did Lauren. She loved it so much, she created another animal, then another, and another. The woods were full of her colorful inventions.
Actually, I loved this exhibit so much, I created my own sweet elephant. She had a plaid bow on her head.
And if all of that wasn't enough, when I got home and logged in to my gmail, a 3-D copy of my elephant was waiting for me to cut out and assemble.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-29 19:32:23.477775

I want to also mention that I needed a wheelchair (I came on a knee scooter and wasn’t allowed to take it inside). The staff provided a wheelchair and were really helpful and friendly. This was perhaps my 8-10th visit to Singapore but first to the museum. I would return happily. It is large and could take a full day. 2 restaurants on site.,11-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 19:33:36.304444

I enjoy finding out about the history of the places I visit , especially how they came to be. We were fortunate that the new exhibition tracing Singapore’s origins from the 16th Century began the day we wanted to visit the museum. Even more fortunate that for the first two days, entry was free.
The exhibition , is excellent and the most interactive part for children. I learnt so much about the role of the Dutch East Indies Company in founding trading places such places in Malay and Singapore.
The exhibition uses original maps, artefacts, information boards, audio accounts and paintings. Also a large prow of a ship to stand on and I learned to tie sailors knots.
We spent about two hours in this exhibition and then had lunch in the cafeteria which was very good. Prices as you would expect for this type of venue.
We then ‘did’ the rest of the museum which took another four hours. I now feel so much better informed about everything.
If you really love history spend all day here. If you just have a passing interest there are many other specific areas to focus on, such as the Japanese occupation or the changes to the lives of women.

,1,12,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,652275715,14-02-2019,4,"Worth a Visit, Perhaps","I have good news and bad news. The good news is the National Museum of Singapore’s historic precedence over every other national museum in Southeast Asia. The NMS, then called the Raffles Museum, was founded in 1849. Its closest competitor, Indonesia’s museum, dates from 1862. The Thais opened theirs in 1874; the Cambodians in 1920; the Burmese and Vietnamese in the 1950s; the Malaysians in the ‘60s, and the Lao in the ‘70s. (I’ve been to all of them, and some, more than once.) So the NMS’s institutional history goes back much further than any of these other museums.

The bad news is that it’s the exact opposite when it comes to the actual histories of the nations themselves. The Rangoon museum has a large gallery full of Pyu-period Buddhas going back 2,000 years. The Phnom Penh museum has magnificent Khmer artefacts going back 1,300 years. The Bangkok museum has a complete Siamese chess set and KL’s has a Perak bronze Bodhisattva, both created while Europe was still in its Dark Ages. Jakarta has a courtyard packed with stacks of thousand-year-old stone carvings, apparently because they ran out of space inside the building. Hanoi has fabulous artefacts going back 3,000 years, and even Vientiane has Megalithic standing stones. Singapore, on the other hand, was an insignificant backwater until 200 years ago. Don’t expect thousand-year-old Singaporean bronzes, weapons, tapestries, ceramics, jade necklaces or ivory carvings in the NMS: you’re as likely to find ancient Singaporean ice skates.

For a brief period, 700 years ago, the island may (or may not) have had a modest trading settlement, as “confirmed” by a handful of gold armlets and rings found on Fort Canning Hill, and as romanticized in a book of Malay Annals that are about as historically trustworthy as the tales of Sindbad’s voyages. With a straight face, the Annals’ author assures us that the mighty founder of this long-lost Kingdom of Singapura, Sang Nila Utama, was a direct descendant of Alexander the Great (who lived 1600 years earlier) and that Singapura was finally destroyed after a siege that rivalled that of Troy, when the Javanese attacked it (with an army of 200,000 warriors)! Though this story is patently preposterous, you can nevertheless find a brand-new government-issued heroic statue of Sang Nila Utama down on Boat Quay near where Sir Stamford Raffles landed, Raffles himself being a direct descendant of King Agamemnon—oops, sorry, check that; I meant to say of Ben and Annie Raffles.

So we’re left with an absolutely splendid national history museum building, but a history that only goes back 10% or so of the historical time-lines of every other SE Asian country. The NMS’s curators are up to this challenge, however: they give a tip o’ the hat to the pre-1818 history of the islands, and then realistically focus on the last 200 years.

The Building: The colonial government opened a grand neo-Palladian museum in 1887, on the tail end of Queen Victoria’s Golden Jubilee year, and the building’s immense facade resonates with Imperial pomp and pride. On either end of the facade, pediments bear the United Kingdom’s royal coat of arms, and between them is a grand dome, trumping the Roman model with stained glass all around its base. Inside, the gleaming white rotunda is spectacular; its Roman arches, half-pillars, and black wrought-iron balustrades make for some obvious photo-ops. However, the museum’s interior isn’t at all hidebound and Victorian: you’ll walk along stunning 21st century glass-roofed passageways and courtyards, and many of the exhibits themselves employ cutting-edge technology (see Pediment, Rotunda, Balustrade, and 21st Century photos).

You should find enough interesting exhibits to last you for several hours. There’s a large room full of fashionable clothing from the 1900s to 1930s, including a formal dress uniform, a white linen tropical suit, flapper dresses, formal gowns, and my favourite: a set of khakis —pith helmet and all—that the famous Singapore-based zoo-collector Frank Buck might have worn when he was off trapping tigers and pythons. These aren’t re-creations: they were all dug out from old family cedar chests. (see Dress Uniform, Tropical Suit, and Khakis photos). On the opposite end of the social scale, you can find grim 1890s-era photographs taken inside an opium den (see Opium Den and Opium Den 2 photos: on the first photo the opium den door appears to be bolted and padlocked, never a good sign if you’re a paying customer).

One artefact might be of particular interest to Americans and older Britons: the Revere Bell. This bell was cast in Boston by the Revere family, and donated to St Andrews by the daughter of Paul Revere (the silversmith whose “Midnight Ride” precipitated America’s Revolutionary War and Declaration of Independence), with her stipulation that the bell must be rung every night at eight o’clock sharp to alert every sailor in town to immediately finish his grog and re-board his ship (being a proper Bostonian, she was rather puritanical about drunken sailors). Older Britons will of course immediately realize that (1) having a single church-bell shut down every pub in town simultaneously is much more efficient than expecting every publican in Singapore to be equipped with both a reliable timepiece and a small bell to ring as he calls out “time, gentlemen, time please” and (2) having to close pubs at 8:00 pm is even worse than those aggravating tavern times under the Defence of the Realm Act. Unfortunately, the Revere Bell had a fatal flaw and is no longer in operation. Fortunately, the same is true of the Defence of the Realm Act. (See Revere Bell and Bell Inscription photos).

The materials on Singapore during the 1942-1945 Japanese occupation were extremely interesting, bringing home what daily life was like to regular Singaporean citizens. I particularly admired the Japanese movie poster in English about a blockbuster new movie coming to a Singapore theatre near you, which will use “actual battle footage” to show Singaporeans “how the invincible Imperial Army brought THE FALL OF SINGAPORE.” This action-packed thriller was produced by the Press Section of the Yamashita Corps itself. I’d be interested in seeing that film, even though I know how the sequel ends: the Imperial Army turns out to be vincible after all, and Yamashita himself gets hanged for war crimes (though the Manila ones, not the Singapore ones; see the Fall of Singapore Poster photo).

Finally, there are the ten national treasures. Don’t expect Lion Thrones or Jade Buddhas, but NMS is doing the best it can. One of the treasures is that Javanese gold jewellery. At the time they were probably buried, the Strait offshore had a serious piracy problem: nearby Bintan Island alone was said to have harboured 300 pirate ships (perhaps another fabulous exaggeration). No Javanese jewellery is Singapore-made of course, and it might well be buried pirate loot rather than proof of a long-lost trading centre on Singapura Island, but as the only ancient gold horde ever discovered in Singapore, it will have to do.

Of the other national treasures, two stand out in my opinion:

First, a full-length portrait of Sir Frank Swettenham, done by John Singer Sargent. It’s a splendid painting, and Swettenham was a remarkable man. As a national treasure, it would have been equally or even more appropriate for Malaysia’s national museum (which does have an imposing statue of him in front of it). Swettenham was one of about three dozen governors that Singapore had over 140 years of British rule, and his 4-year term was about par. However, during his tenure, he pursued a policy of trying to pry away Siam’s tributary states of Kelantan and Trengganu and absorb them into the British Empire. His immediate success was limited to King Rama the Great reluctantly agreeing to appoint British advisers to these provinces, but the eventual result was to transfer sovereignty of both provinces, as well as Kedah, to the British, and hence to modern Malaysia. (To the credit of the Thai monarchy, however, Siam was the only Asian coastal nation from the Mediterranean to the South China Sea, that was never under either European rule or European occupation). Sargent’s heroic portrait shows Swettenham in a dress uniform that is identical to the one mentioned above, but with the addition of the star of St. Michael and St. George, and a dress sword. If you think Sargent depicts him as a strong-willed man, an uncompromising imperialist, and perhaps a bit of a cad, both you and the artist might be correct.

Second, the William Farquhar Collection of Natural History Drawings. William Farquhar was the military engineer who blew the historic walls of Malacca to smithereens (on strict orders) prior to Malacca’s restoration to the Dutch, though Raffles urged him not to; when the Brits and Dutch then negotiated a treaty under which Britain wound up keeping Malacca after all, Farquhar was the goat, and Raffles got the credit for having been right. Farquhar spoke Malay fluently and negotiated the treaty that ceded the rights to Singapore to the UK, at which point Raffles sailed in, signed the treaty and got full credit for it. Farquhar was the Resident who built up Singapore during its first four formative years, at which point Raffles sailed in and promptly dismissed Farquhar. Farquhar formally complained of his treatment, and the Company directors sided with Raffles. Raffles and Farquhar both had roads named after them in Singapore; nowadays there’s both a Raffles Blvd and a Raffles Avenue, while Farquhar’s road was obliterated 15 years ago, and no Singapore road now bears his name. There’s a Raffles Place and a Raffles Hotel; you’ll look in vain for Farquhar counterparts. There actually still is a Farquhar Terrace on one edge of Fort Canning Hill; I never sit downhill from it, expecting the freak landslide any day now. Every time they interacted, Raffles wound up coming out on top, and Farquhar on the bottom. Both men were avid naturalists; the largest flower on Earth is named after Raffles; Farquhar never even got a weed named after him. Both men commissioned drawings of flora and fauna. Farquhar’s collection of natural history drawings wasn’t bad, not bad at all; but Raffles’ collection was bigger and better and also included Java, so he even came out on top for natural history drawing collections. Sir Stamford Raffles then sailed back home to high honours in England. But hold on; what’s this? Before arriving back in Blighty, Raffles’ ship caught fire and his collection of natural history drawings went up in flames, leaving only Farquhar’s as a unique collection dating from the birth of Singapore. A great loss to the field of natural history, of course, much to be regretted; but finally, FINALLY something worked out with Farquhar on top of Raffles! The Chinese artists Farquhar used were quite good, and the drawings, like those of Audubon, are works of art. Of all ten national treasures, this is the one you’ll probably spend the most time looking at. You could actually spend more time on these beautiful drawings, than the other nine treasures combined.

I’m giving the National Museum of Singapore 4 stars, which might not be fair, but if I rated it 5, that would mean that I think it’s as worthwhile as the Singapore Zoo, the Southern Ridges, the Botanical Gardens, Sultan Mosque, Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Gardens by the Bay, and Clarke Quay (I could add more). My instinct is that if you’re spending two weeks or so as a tourist in Singapore, you should by all means visit the NMS. But if you’re only here for a week or less, the NMS should be lower down on your agenda, particularly if this is your first visit to Asia, because then Kampong Glam, Chinatown, Little India, and the Museum of Asian Civilizations might all be more worthwhile and memorable. I do think the NMS is the best curated and most innovative national history museum in SE Asia; architecturally the museum is second only to Bangkok’s. But its collection cannot compete against those other countries, each with a rich and long history. Even some smaller museums, such as the Cham Sculpture Museum in Da Nang, beat the NMS on that score. So: Very Good, yes; but Essential, no.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 19:34:29.167980

The exhibition gives the impression that life under Japanese rule wasn’t too bad as long as you followed the rules and got the right permits. There is no mention of Sook Ching which was the systematic killing of members of the Chinese population. Officially Japan claims that fewer than 5,000 deaths occurred, while Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, said ""verifiable numbers would be about 70,000"". In 1966 Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. They did not make an official apology.
I do not understand how this could not be mentioned in the exhibition or is it that the museum authorities do not wish to offend anyone. Whitewashing history is wrong.",04-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 19:35:43.358686

Well, one important reason is that while the other museums and galleries provide narratives about the South East Asia and Asia, NMS is unapologetically and exclusively about the nation's narrative from the 13th to the 21st century, at least up to the passing of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015.

The modest size of the museum, relative to the British Museum and the national museums of many nations, suits the relatively short history of Singapore (Tumasik, Dan maxi). The galleries span three floors and are thoughtfully curated to provide a fluid narrative of the nation. If Singaporeans think they know and understand their nation's story from the history and National Education (or Character & Citizenship Education) lessons in school, then they are very much mistaken. The exhibits offer intimate insights into the narratives through visual and auditory stimuli that no teacher or textbook can provide. The museum context also means that viewers are focused on engaging the themes for understanding rather than scoring in tests and examinations.

For visitors to Singapore, the galleries will help them better appreciate the significance of the various landmarks they visit. It is in the context of the past that the present Singapore is better understood. Otherwise, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Singapore River, China Town, Little India, Geylang Serai, etc, are no more than tourist traps meant to bring in the tourist dollar.

NMS provides a coherent visual narrative of Singapore from its days as a trading post, Crown Colony, Syonan-to, through to a modern independent city-nation. It is perhaps, at the time of this review, the only such establishment to do so.

Expect to spend up to 3hours at NMS, longer if you intend to have a meal at one of its two restaurants.

From the Malay princes through to Chinese traders, Indian migrants, Stamford Raffles, two World Wars, a brief union with Malaysia and the shiny modern metropolis of today, there's a lot to take in. Thankfully, the National Museum does a very good job of this.

The main gallery is the absolute key here. It starts with pre-history and gradually steps the visitor through every important piece of the story, with good amounts of focus on the key players - Raffles, of course, but also figures of high local importance like Tan Tock Seng and Omar al-Junied, who perhaps aren't as well-known outside of the island.
As well as the customary collection of exhibits behind glass, there are also some audio-visual elements, including a rather over-acted video detailing Raffles' machinations in claiming Singapore for London, and some reminiscences of locals describing the smell of the Singapore River in the 1960s (one of these is delivered in very thick Singlish, and could almost benefit from a translation).

The split from Malaysia is described - naturally from the Singaporean side of that dispute - and this time around I even saw the original television appearance of the teary Lee Kuan Yew announcing that momentous piece of news, which I didn't remember from a previous visit.

There are a couple of other significant museums to visit elsewhere in Singapore - the various Heritage Centres for the three major ethnic groups provide very important pieces of the story as well - but this should be on everyone's itinerary if they're interested in understanding the whys and wherefores of this remarkable little country.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:37:38.480867

Like many museums it is a quiet place but is filled with information and displays on the many people who have contributed to making Singapore what it is today. travelling in time from the early settlers and the eventual British involvement gives a good understanding of how Singapore has become the multi-cultural hub it is today.
The building itself is exceptionally well maintained and provides a glimpse of colonial times.
There is an entry fee but don't be put off by this - the experience is well worth the cost.
The forest display is another not to miss. the domed theatre is used to project images of thousands of flowers falling with occasional comets passing through. Certainly one your children would love almost as much as you will.
I would personally give the museum restaurant a miss as service is incredibly slow and staff could be described as disinterested at best.
When you finish take a walk through the nearby Fort Canning Park for more history and some great gardens (again give the food here a miss)",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 19:37:38.806290

One is a museum of art with changing exhibitions and in the other the history of the city-state of Singapore is presented. We visited the latter.
The emergence of Singapore is in an alternating manner shown by means of film images, slide projections, documents, photographs and objects with a story. We think that it is therefore also suitable for children over 8 years, but then as parents you can spend less time in the galleries. In that case you get less information about the background of the history of this city-state, and why things have gone as they have gone. The exposés about that we found fascinating.
In addition, we had the impression that as the history becomes more recent, this is dealt with more superficial (such as the union, and thereafter the break with Malaysia). This is logical when you consider that former choices and interests can still play a role in the current political situation.

For visitors who are interested in how the unique Singapore has arisen, we can recommend this museum. Expect a visit time of 30 minutes (with children) to 1.5 hours or longer if you want to take note of all backgrounds .",10-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 19:39:17.313386

Some of the exhibits take the visitor through the personal journey of individual Singaporeans and uses that as a tool to explain the history of the country, spanning over a thousand years, with more focus on the last two hundred years of course. This is certainly a rather unusual way of presenting history, and made it all the more interesting.

For anyone with an interest in history generally or in Singapore's history particularly, this is a very good place to start. The building is nice as well, and there are couple of places to eat on site, including a fine dining restaurant and a casual cafe style place (Food for Thought) where we had a late lunch.

It is a unique experience to visit it and the tour is well worth the time and money.

However, two caveats: there are many stairs and it's not always possible to use elevators to get from one place to another; given all the space, I thought there were surprisingly few works of art displayed. The latter may have been because they were redoing some areas and there other kinds of exhibits to see.

After the war was also covered nicely if briefly showing the 2 year dalliance with, and subsequent divorce of, Malaysian unification, gaining its own national identity and the whole HDB slash green area initiatives by first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew that has made Singapore the green concrete jungle (in both senses of that word) that it is today.

Actually it kind of started out on a bit of a (I'm really struggling for a word here) unexpected note. After purchasing my ticket, I was directed to an escalator that took me to the the top of the building's rotonda where you wind your way back down viewing a digital display of a forest (which I guess is Singapore back in the day). It was certainly colorful, visually pleasing, and the kids running back and forth seemed to love it. I guess for me, when I go to a museum (especially a national one), I'm expecting to see realia as opposed to basically digital animation. Then again, it's a nice wow factor for the kids. That didn't last long as you find yourself on the bottom floor in the main historical gallery of the museum covering the breadth of Singapore's history. Here is where I found the great displays and information panels I wanted. Too much to go into about what is displayed, but my visit to the museum today left me a question in my mind. A big part of the main historical gallery covers both the British colonial period as well as the Japanese occupation during WWII. There is even a separate display about the Japanese occupation; I believe it was on the second floor of the museum. What I found interesting was that these displays on the Japanese occupation really bring to life the horror that occurred during this period. Yet for the most part, the British colonial is sort of viewed through rose-colored glasses. Yes there are disturbing displays about things such as how the colonial British ""encouraged"" opium addiction, but I would think colonial occupation to be just as horrific, maybe even more debilitating, and certainly more insidious then a much shorter period of wartime occupation. I am certainly not trying to minimize the responsibility of the Japanese for their war crimes, it's just that I left the museum wondering why the scope of the British colonial period is not viewed in a similar manner.",05-2019,Solo,2020-01-29 19:41:34.154084

I spent 90 minutes walking through this exhibit and didn’t touch on a lot of it. There was also a neat exhibit regarding conservation, which I didn’t take any photos of but did take a number of videos. Singapore is definitely onboard with saving the planet! This exhibit used film and animation to produce it’s intended effect and it did not disappoint. I would highly recommend a visit here if you are interested in the history of Singapore!

I didn’t bother with the special exhibitions. But the main ones tell the story of Singapore from the 14th century through to the present day. The surprise surrender of the British in 1941 and the tough period of Japanese occupation until the end of World War II, which eventually culminated in full independence in 1965, is well told.

Upstairs, there are four smaller galleries which tell you how the people of Singapore experienced different periods of history - from the lively 1920s and 30s, through to the explosion of modernity in the 1970s and 80s.

A big part of the museum is devoted to the WWII period and the life and suffering under Syonan, the Japanese occupation from 1942-45. And even a bigger part to the political, societal, cultural and economic development of the city state post WWII and Singapore successful strive for independence in 1965 and becoming one of the richest countries in the world under the leadership of its premier minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and his PAP party. A little propaganda-ish but hard to argue with their achievements today.

I'm a huge sucker for old maps; coins & paper money and historical posters exhibits, and there are some to enjoy.

Plus, Singapore, being promoted as the ""garden"" city, you must visit the audiovisual feast of flowers falling inside the glass rotunda in the modern wing of the museum. It is amazing and worth to experience it just laying down on the floor. You feel almost just like inside the movie Avatar. It's called ""The story of the forest"" and I'm pretty sure it's just a temporary exhibit. So, don't miss it;)

It is a little hard though not to get lost if you want to follow the exhibits chronologically. Devote at least 2 hours to enjoy it, or much more if you like to ponder over every exhibit details.

Recommended for kids, too... They will definitely like the Glass Rotunda exhibit.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 19:42:57.987142

It was oddly relaxing. Afterwards there was Singapore, Very Old Tree, which is an installation of photos in light boxes of people with their favorite trees, inspired by an old post card that simply read ""Singapore, Very Old Tree.""

The lady on the desk was very helpful and advised me that a tour would begin at 1 p.m. if I would like to join it. She pointed to the spot where I was to meet the guide. As I had an hour to wait, I went and had a fish and chips lunch (S$16.00 ++) at the Terrace Café. Unfortunately the fish, covered in thick batter, was almost inedible because the fillets under the batter were dark and slimy.

At 12.50 p.m. I returned to the place which had been pointed out to me but when no-one else had turned up by 1.20 p.m. I left and explored the exhibits by myself.

I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the exhibit which explains the history of Singapore is like a maze. I found it disjointed with no clear indication of the pathway to follow in order to view the displays. Therefore, I often found myself out of sequence with the timeline.

Started with a tour of the Singapore history section (free admission for citizens but tourist has to pay a fee for entry) and spent 2.5hours here. Unfortunately, they were closing soon, so had to rush a few parts. As a citizen here, it was very informative, engaging and has some beautiful places to take a few pictures with/of (thou, as per norm, no flash allowed).

Currently, they are holding ""The More We Get Together: Singapore's Playgrounds 1930 – 2030"" exhibition showcasing the experience of growing up in Singapore, which ends on September 2018.

It took us about 4 hours to go through the museum and we ate lunch there. This is a good quality museum and I recommend going to see it.

Then as I explored, there was one after another piece of art or object, or even the interior of the building that attracted my attention.

They had a number of temporary exhibitions - which I enjoyed thoroughly, it was about 'Forest' - how the exhibition ensured that visitors get the chance to interact with what was exhibited. The exhibition made me got so interested and immersed in what they want us to know.

It was like in every part of the museum, they make sure that we stay attracted, and stimulated our way of thinking, making sure we think beyond our normal day-to-day thinking, deeper in thoughts.

The exhibits are all presented ever so creatively, with props and visual aids that really bring out the atmosphere and allow you to immerse yourself into the past. Of course, for many of us, the different exhibits also present opportunities for us to take our photos and OOTDs.

There are many different exhibits in the museum, spread across different floors. The permanent ones include exhibits like Singapore History Gallery, Growing Up (where you get to see the kampung life of the 1950s and 60s), Surviving Syonan (where you can listen to stories of those who have been through the Japanese Occupation in Singapore during World War II).

My favourite from the permanent exhibits would be the Glass Rotunda, which has been furnished and reopened recently, this time with an installation known as the Story of the Forest. It was really amazing, as you could almost immerse yourself entirely into this fantasy world with lights and images of the forest and the magical creatures.

Right now, there is also a temporary exhibit called What is Not Visible is not Invisible, which is pretty interesting with its many installations. And yes, these are the exhibits that make good photo opportunities for your Instagram or Facebook feed.

It's free for Singapore citizens and PRs, and even for tourists, the admission fee is worth paying for, because the museum is really a masterpiece.

To get there, take the train to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station, and take any exit from the North-South Line (red line). Then, walk towards Rendezvous Hotel and Singapore Management University (SMU). Behind SMU, you would see a building with the words ""YMCA"" on it. The National Museum of Singapore is just next to it.",01-2017,Friends,2020-01-29 19:48:25.603157

The British Museum exhibit was a selection of artifacts covering the globe, mostly ancient history -- a well chosen cross section, nicely written up and displayed.

The Singapore history and culture galleries cover various eras right up to the modern age and have been creatively put together -- a wide selection of exhibits has been painstakingly collected and displayed .

The Museum also has a good shop and restaurants -- we ate lunch at the cafe and it was excellent.

All in all, a very pleasant half day visit. And like everything else in Singapore, very well organized including great accessibility especially since I took my mother on a wheelchair.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 19:49:09.823220

Their website states that limited parking is available. I did provide feedback directly to the museum recommending the website be corrected to state that NO PARKING is available. Even if you arrive before the museum opens, you'll find that the few parking spaces at the front of the building are all occupied by staff.
The British Museum currently has an exhibit on loan in the basement. The permanent collections provide a history of Singapore.

Free entrance for Singaporeans.
Chargeable for the special exhibitions that change periodically.

You need to get your tickets at the entrance, so just re-cap with the staff which are the free/chargeable exhibits.

Gorgeous historical building that's been renovated. Interior looks spanking new, modern touch with lots of natural light.

My fav was the ""Voices of Singapore , 1975 - 1985"" exhibition. Takes you back in time, with items on display that remain true to how things were back in the day, including a re-creation of a small drive-in theatre and old-school movies. You'll smile and cringe all at once (in a good way of course!). There's also a bicycle on display that once belonged to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during his youth - a nice touch that adds depth and authenticity to the exhibition.

Not sure if the younger kids below 10 years old will enjoy visiting the museum as some of the themes / exhibits may be a tad adult for them but still worth walking around. I bet some of the young ones will enjoy the ""Voices of Singapore"" exhibit like me :)

Lots of photo opp: natural light | dome-shaped ceiling at the entrance | spiral staircase on Level 2.

Small souvenir store on Level 2; items with a local flavour that Singaporeans and tourists alike will appreciate (think small pouches and coasters stitched with the Sarong Kebaya motif). A tad pricey but makes for a nice souvenir.

I used this visit to explore the surrounding Stamford Road / Beach Road area and nearby museums (eg: Singapore Art Museum) - all within walking distance. A good map is all you need. Start early at 10am or 11am and keep walking!
