The park is open every day of the year and about 20 minutes from Marina Bay. We took a grab (like uber) and it was under $10USD. A favorite area was the Wings of Asia where a person can observe the birds in their natural habitat up close. In the park make sure to see the unusual: Edward’s pheasant, Philippine eagle and the Mindanao bleeding heart. A person of any age could easily spend a day here with bird shows, feeding the birds and wildlife tours.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:22.185121

If you love birds, a place to go with family especially when you have children. The place is educational for the children. There are penguins, emu, stork, vultures, macaws and many more.

If you don wan to walk too much, you can also opt for tram ride. There are different shows too, do refer to the brochure, they are worth stopping over to watch and hear the explanation by the park staff.

With stopping to take pictures and rest stop for the legs, it takes about 2-3 hour slow leisure to complete the visit.

Do have a good pair of walking shoes and bring water bottle with you to stay hydrated. There is no shelter in most of the exhibits so if you come during a rainy season, you may want to bring an umbrella",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:23.658053

Got to know that only after reaching the park. We contacted Ms.Priya (Ticketing in charge) of jurong bird park and told our concern. She immediately discussed the issue with the official there and allowed all of us to enter the park, and asked us to send tickets through WhatsApp later when we reach the hotel. That was a great help for us, as kids were very eager to see the birds and we would've been really disappointed if we had missed the bird park. Had she not acted spontaneously with concern for us we would have missed the wonderful bird park. We all enjoyed both the shows and happen to see many new species of birds. It was the most memorable day.

Thanks to Priya madam & the entire team.",10-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:31.009314

There are beautiful birds like flamingos at the entrance & various other rare birds also.The Chimpanzees hopping on the tree brances is most enjoyed by both children & adults alike. There are few eateries also inside for the hungry stomachs. You can take photos also at the entrance with big colourful birds by professional photographers & ofcourse with some fees.
On the whole it is a most enjoyable & memorable visit for the whole family & must see visit for the tourists. The cleanliness & tidiness of the attraction inspite of so many visitors is amazing and kudos to the staff there.",12-2018,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:32.906503

Buy the unlimited tram ride then hop on off as the park is quite extensive especially if it’s hot.

I wouldn’t stay for lunch as I’ve had enough if birds after 4-5 hours close by is the science museum or IMM factory outlet store.

I’d recommend it as a pretty good tourist attraction. Well kept clean and the staff are helpful. Most of the shows were pretty entertaining",09-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:39.836879

The place itself is designed mainly for young children. Like any zoo, the poor birds look miserable in their cages, unable to fly anywhere. I did not enjoy this place.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:42.852537

Time your visit well so that you don't miss the feeding and bird shows. You can use the tram but I don't think it's required as it can be covered on foot if you have time/energy. Kids will certainly love the place. Don't miss the waterfall aviary.

We reached there around 11 am. A nice place to visit especially with children and better if you like birds. Large array of birds are kept including penguins. It’s good if you walk around and cover the place on foot. Many varieties of hornbills which you won’t find anywhere else. A small tram which costs 5 dollars extra, but must try. It covers the whole park. Few food joints are available near the entrance as well as outside. But the show stopper was bird feeding area. We enjoyed this activity the most especially my daughter. Nectars are available at 2 dollars which you can buy and feed the birds. They will come and sit on your hands and eat the nectar. Bird lovers will definitely love it. There are some other live shows also take place which you can attend. Overall an interesting place to visit. Keep 3 to 4 hours to complete it.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:49.100234

The park is not as spread out as the Zoo, so no real need to take the tram.

Go early in the day to avoid the heat and larger crowds.

Attend all the shows that you can, they are free, educational, and very entertaining.

If you have young kids (under 10), bring swimsuits so they can use the wet playground.

If you are in good health and do not have very young kids, a tram ticket is not necessary. The park is not huge and is very walkable.

Bring a picnic, outside food is allowed, and the food options in the park are just ok.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:25:49.864443

We then went back to the animals we wanted to see more closely. The park has a nice kids water play area - recommend that they have a supervisor at all times as some parents were not watching their kids. The shows were the highlight of our visit.

It's difficult to see the birds through the old-fashioned cages and difficult to take their pictures. Also, the park is on a hill so it's really hard in the heat to walk up and down constantly to see the birds. The little train that takes people around stops too far from the trees we want to see.

It came to rain but we still wondered around the whole place.
If I’m honest I think the pace is really run down and not worth a visit. Birds didn’t look great and especially the avary part where peacocks roam freely etc. The place was filthy. Yes birds are messy but when there are cafes near by etc it was full of poo and just felt old.

To top it off o sent my kids to buy bird food. Advertises $2. My son came back with 2 and no change. The guys don’t have change here be warned and stick the whole lot into a donation box.

Very meticulously planned.
Buy tickets for Jurong park with tram ride.
There are 4-5 small blocks to be visited in the park. The tram has 4 stops and it takes you around. You can get down at any stop of your interest and visit that area.
Recommended method.
First sit in the tram and resist your temptation to get down at every stop.
See all the stops in one circuit and then get down to doing each segment one by one.
One section has a mini splash park for kids. Owing to the weather of Singapore, the kids are giong to love this.....but be careful....get into it only if you have a full day for the Park, else avoid it.
Recommended to start the tour in the morning and definitely dont miss the BIRD SHOW at the AMPHITHEATER. 11:00 & 3;00 pm everyday.
Worth a visit for all age groups.
Has a limited variety of restaurants also. For Indians, soth indian cuisine available in a restaurant just outside the park.",06-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:26:00.628823

They have interactive bird shows like ‘Kings of the skies’ showing prey animals and a Parrot show at the Pools Amphitheatre. Many more shows I guess which I couldn’t explore. These shows are a must watch for all ages as they are very entertaining. You can roam around the park on a tram which halts at stations designated for specific bird enclosure.

The Entrance itself already features lots of eatery and well design garden and clean toilets, Upon entry, the penguin is just next to it on the right, where you can enjoy the cool aircondition away from the heat before or after the walk about.
Walking further in is where you buy the tram ticket, which is for whole day ride, priced at SGD $5 for adult and $3 for children. As this place is not as crowded as zoo, the wait is quick, only 4 stops and every stops deserve a visit.
Station 2 is where you can feed the birds, walk the hanging bridge, see horbill and their beautiful song, walking further down the road is the HUGE birds of prey, vultures and eagles.
Station 3 is a man made waterfall, you come in contact with birds and lots of peacock roaming around you, just keep your kids hand to themselves please.
Station 4 is where you visit the beautiful parrots, touted as the only one in the world, their call is loud and you may even get to hear them speak. walking further down is the flamingo valley, at least a hundred of them standing together.
The timing not to miss are the feeding of birds of prey 10am and 4pm, feeding of penguin 10:30am and 3:30pm, bird show at 3 and 4pm, parrot show at 1pm. Sorry I am not too sure about the timing, please check with the park rangers at the park.
So your kids can enjoy bird feeding and penguin feeding, don't miss visiting during the right hour.

We were wondering if there would be something to see for more than 2 hours and we were so wrong! Once can spend a day entirely in this bird park. The park itself is spread across a huge area and is divided into bird exhibits from various parts of the world.

The enclosures are not suffocating for the birds and in many of those enclosures, you can actually get inside to spot the birds, some of them friendly and some shy away. It is a fun exercise to do with young children.

Birds not to miss
- Penguins at the entrance (I felt a bit of pity to see that they had the least space as it requires cooling)
- Lory Loft
- Hornbills an Toucans
- High flyers Show (at 11:00am in the Pools Amphitheater)
- Waterfall Aviary - Definitely a Must See
- Parrot Paradise

Make sure to take the Tram ticket as it can be convenient to go from one place to another at times

25 years later, I'm back with a little bub of my own who loves birds, and I am very impressed with how much the park has changed since then. The bird shows were fun, with interactive segments. There's a water playground -- a favourite with children, so bring your swimsuits, sunblock & a change of clothes! You can actually walk around the whole park with some rest in between, but it can get very hot, so purchasing those tram tickets can help those with movement challenges / elderly / with babies. For parents, bring your strollers, the paths are generally wide & flat - although there's a few exhibits where you'll need to fold-up your stroller and carry it up some stairs and/or the paths are narrower and it's just easier to park your stroller outside & carry your kid around.

Unless you're a bird fanatic, half a day will be adequate for covering all the exhibits. Pack your own lunches, there're sitting areas with tables where you can have a picnic, though bear in mind that many are unshaded. There're water refill stations all around, so bring your own water bottles.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-29 17:26:24.779766

The first thing we found out that the discounted seniors price advertised only applies to Singapore residents all other countries pay full price.
We paid the extra five dollars for the tram ride. At station one we were told to take a seat because we are disabled. We waited for ages and still told to take a seat. After waiting for a long time we got up and walked off. They ignored us.
The bird show happens twice a day and we watched that. A show not to be missed. Very well done.
The park is well set out and if you can get the tram to high spots and walk back down looking at all the enclosures. There are shops and food outlets around the park and plenty of rest rooms/toilets around the park.
They also have water bottle refill stations at the tram stops.
There are a vast number of birds on display and in the middle a fantastic water park for the children. Bring their costumes and towels.
The walk in enclosures gets you up and close to the birds.
It takes about 4 hours to see it all and well worth it.
Bus tours turn up in the morning but they are gone by lunch time.
In 2020 the park allegedly moves to the Singapore Zoo we were told.
A special thanks to Annie in the shop at the Kids Water Park and Sun Win who works with her. Annie was great in serving up and is a credit to the Bird Park. Well done.

Still there are a few excellent shows but not up to the standard of my previous visits this is my 4th one.

The park is amazing – hundreds of varieties of birds from all over the world, many of which are critically endangered or on the verge of extinction in their natural habitats. Be warned it is huge, with some ‘must sees’ too – ours were the waterfall aviary, wings of Asia and parrot paradise, but we are slightly biased as we are hyacinth macaw fans!
The High Flyers show was great although we were very concerned as to the number of group tours there, but they seemed to ‘disappear’ after the show so guess they were on a ‘whirlwind tour’ of Singapore which included a couple of hours here.
We took our time – we are animal and bird enthusiasts – we sat regularly and also drank plenty as it got hotter as the day went on. Including eating lunch (but not visiting the kids play park) we spent five hours here!

That said the bird park is still wort the time. getting there is no more difficult that the zoo though the bus connection at the train stop is not quite so obvious. The entry way with its arch of orchids is truly impressive. The lay out is not quite as efficient as the night safari at the zoo and we found we did some doubling back at times. We saw some spectacular birds and the bird show we saw was quite excellent. What disappointed us was that, at times, there was no information about the origin of these birds. Generally the huge walk in aviaries had notice boards that helped identify the birds within and we found ourselves trotting back and forth to do just that. But, at times we had no idea which countries were the natural habitat of these great.creatures. In one aviary we met an attendant willing to talk and we had a very informative conversation about the birds close by.

Grace is very welcoming and heart warming and Denver got really comfortable with her quickly and they both chatted away taking about the different kinds of birds and Grace was so patient with Denver’s queries, answering each of them with love. It was a memorable experience and we got to get up close with some of Denver’s favourite birds like the Hornbill, Hawk, Vulture and Owl. We even got to see a baby owl that was one month old at the time of our visit and it was so cute and fluffy.

In some, you can walk through the habitats and see the birds in the various enclosures. Some have a large number of the birds roaming free within the glasshouse so they can fly past you or walk past you on the path as you are looking around and exploring. It's great to be able to see most of the birds up close with the open enclosures for some.

At the Lory feeding area, there is a large suspension bridge that is great for walking and taking pictures.

There are also bird shows conducted at various areas in the park.

Food choices are very simple as compared to other wildlife attractions in Singapore.

The large playground and waterplay area is great for kids and looks to be a newer developed section of the park. There is a place to eat as well as a store that sells gear and accessories required for waterplay.

The displays are large enough with several birds that make it easy to spot them while in the shuttle.Kid and husband enjoyed feeding the birds a lot. Unfortunately by the time I got my turn the birds had been given a snack of grapes and thus non were around. Witnessing the interaction with birds during this feeding left me speechless. The birds communicated with movements and it was clear what they were trying to convey. This is an experience that shall forever stay with me.The park has a very interesting water play area, where the kid spend well over 3 hours and had to be coerced out at closing.While he was enjoying the cold splash I got to chat with Maggie on staff, who was studying lightening data for the park system.

Pigeons, doves, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, hornbills - you are going to surely have a great time amidst nature.

I recommend buying tickets online, for there is a long queue at the ticketing counters at the park and thus, it costs time. Taxi is the best way to come to Jurong Bird Park, since the MRT-Bus Combo takes a very long time and is inconvenient, too.

Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, Wings of Asia, Royal Ramble, the show, Flamingo and Pelican Lakes, Hornbills, are some of the many sights worth visiting. Not to forget the beautiful Penguin Coast just at the entrance.

There are many dining options there, with Pizza Hut Express being inside the premises of Jurong Bird Park. I recommend buying the ticket for the unlimited Tram Ride too, if travelling with elderly or small children. Very convenient and not expensive.

Being a pigeon lover, I loved the aviary ""Wings of Asia"", where there was a large variety of friendly-pigeons.

Even though we were there with our 3 year old son we still covered most parts of the park. The varieties of birds is immense and the resplendent colours a joy for the viewer.

In half a day we could manage only one of the two shows and two feedings. the penguin feeding turned out to be a dud for us as we are vegetarians and couldn't get around to feeding fish to the penguins with our hands. The lory feeding was much more fun. For SGD 3 you get a small glass of nectar to feed the birds. The lory loft has various levels and criss cross wooden bridges which itself give you an adventure feel. The birds hardly have any nectar - in fact you will find it difficult to finish even half the glass. But they hop on to your hands, shoulders, head and that itself is so much fun. A pair of lories stuck to my head for a good 7-8 minutes before my child shooed them away forcibly.

The Waterfall Aviary was the best area of the lot as you could walk around freely with the birds. My son chased quite a few of them and in general had an amazing time looking for birds hidden in bushes.

The entire park is well planned out though they could have avoided some of the uphill walking. Most enclosures and the birds in them are beautiful especially the penguins and the pelicans.

The birds couldn't complete their performance. One of the parrots didn't speak and one bird didn't fishish the flying performance through the circles. The host said that 'cause they were old. They were too old then why were the forced to work??? I don't support this kind of entertainment.

We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then took the bus 194, which took us right in front of the bird park.
After the high flyers show, we walked around the park and had some lunch. It was very hot. My children spent a long time at the waterplay so we ran out of time to see some of the birds. On leaving the park, we enquired about converting the day tickets to membership and it was a straightforward process after a SGD8 top up (as one of us is a Singaporean, we paid less on the day ticket). We went again the next day and as it was a weekday, we could go on the tram for free as members (otherwise, we would have to pay SGD16 for the whole family). We went to the Rory loft and other places.

We enjoyed the new features (as what we saw previously were no longer around), and also the shows. We saw many tourists visiting the park but sadly, we the locals were very little. We hope JBP continue to work hard attracting our own peoples to visit the park.",08-2018,Family,2020-01-29 17:30:05.260513

Getting there - we took the MRT (Boon Lay MRT) and then crossed over to the bus terminal and got the 194 bus which drops you off just outside the park (this is contrary to what Google Maps will tell you - it says to catch the bus from a different location; this is incorrect). It takes about 70-80 minutes to get to Jurong Bird Park from central Singapore.

Layout - The park is well laid out and as it is situated on the side of a hill you do quite a bit of uphill and downhill walking. For those who do not want to walk around the park there is a tram that circles the park and costs $5 per adult for unlimited hop on hop off.

The Park - We loved the shows, especially the High Flyers Show (sit in the middle just below half way if you want to have a good chance of being selected for audience participation), the Lory Loft where the birds sit on your arm, shoulders and head to get food or nibble at your cap and the Hornbills & Toucans display. The Parrot Paradise is also worthwhile. The Breeding & Research Centre and Bird Discovery Centre are also good (both are air conditioned and also provide interesting educational material and the chance to see birds being incubated and new hatchlings).

We found the park to be clean and the bird cages were well maintained. There were plenty of staff all over the park ensuring that the surrounds were kept neat and tidy.

Food & Water - There are a number of food outlets across the park and free water refill stations across the park so make sure you bring a water bottle with you. We had lunch at the Hawk Cafe which has a range of local food for around $8 - just remember to get a stamp to come back in after lunch as you access the cafe through the exit shop.",07-2018,Family,2020-01-29 17:30:25.393933

It is a full day activity and do not club any thing else with this.
The best part is that you can rent prams and an. Electric scooter so my father aged 75 did not need to walk at all
He could move in it every where even the pram was acessable thorough out the park

Went to Lory Loft where we donated $3 to buy nectar water to feed the birds, staff on duty were very honest to let us know that it’s either there’s not many birds around or the birds were fully fed, but we still go ahead.. managed to feed a few birds.

Yes, my friend may be in the wrong to try taking a photo, but she could have polite ask him not to do so, and if he did, ask him to delete the photo. She should not use physical action. My friend was nice enough to smile at her.. when I approached her to check out what had happened (my sis witnessed the scene and informed me), Fatin was rude and defended herself aggressively! Throwing her belongings into the cupboard unhappily, banging things here and there. I believe she called her superior who came shortly and approached me. He explained to me about her personal issue, apologised on behalf and gave us a card to access the photo online. Logan was professional in handling the situation.

We could have stayed much longer than 6 hours, but we were limited by the little one's energy level. We enjoyed the penguin feeding and the birds of flight show, highlighting the macaws, toucan, pelicans, flamingos etc.
The Lory Loft was our highlight where we could purchase a liquid feed and feed the colourful lorikeets, which often landed on our outstretched arms without fear!
Personally I enjoyed the flamboyant flamingos with their long skinny legs.

They also had a water theme park area where little ones could cool down and regain energy and enthusiasm to continue with the park. A definite place to stop and cool down if travelling with kids.

A must for anyone who loves birds.

Finally on 3rd day of our trip we went to Jurong bird park.... Took a cab to reach this place as it was the most convenient option... No direct metro service was available and we had to shift from metro to a bus after reaching a point... Didn't want to do any sort of adventure so took a cab...

Reached this place around 2pm.... I would recommend people to visit much earlier... As soon as you enter there are people who will take a family snap with birds on your hand... Sounded like fun so went for it. It was a rip off... One picture they charge 30SHD... Also they will block your view so that nobody can click with their personal camera.

There are 2 ways of visiting this place... One you can walk around or take a bus trip. We took the bus trip which lasted for 20mins and didn't get to see any birds properly... Visiting this place by feet is the best option....

Now coming back to the bird park... You will get to see some amazing birds that you would have never heard of... They have maintained the place so well. The best part of Jurong is their bird shows... It happens every alternate hour. So plan your visit in such a way that you will cover most bird shows... It's incredible to see how well the birds are trained and how the performers keep the audience glued to their seats... The best thing to do in Jurong is to watch the bird shows...

Many magnificent and varying types of birds with good interaction with visitors. Get there early as can get crowded later in the day - opens at 8.30am which would be a good time to arrive. Cost is Sg$30 + $5 for the train. As a lot of walking is involved, I would recommend hiring an electric wheelchair for $20. Taxis turn up often for departing also a van service (10 seater) is available outside near taxi rank for $50 anywhere in Singapore - good value for families and no wait for a taxi.

There is a lot of shade to relax in and multiple places to stop and relax. The only reason that I have not given it a 5/5 is because I think the food choices could be improved on.

We arrived at the park around 12.30 in the afternoon planning to tour the park then do the 15.00 &16.00 shows. Firstly we took the tram to Lory Loft to see the Toucans & hornbills. Next we took the tram to the waterfall Aviary. I fell in love with this place, so tranquil with the sound of water splashing & birds singing in the trees. We spent a lot of time here (more than an hour) so we had to miss the last stop to get back in time for the High flyers show at 15.00. As we sat down we could hear the thunder in the distance. The show started at 15.00, but within 5 minutes the heavens opened & there was a torrential downpour, every one ran for cover & I must give the park staff a round of applause for trying to carry on with the show from under the tent, but in the end they had to cancel the show for safety reasons. The noise of the rain on the Canopy was horrendous. Stopped at the Penguin exhibit as it was inside but the rain did not stop & so the kings of the skies show was also cancelled. Stopped for a bite to eat at the Hawk cafe on the way out hoping the rain would stop but it just kept on coming.

The shows that they have will truly blow your mind and is a fun activity to do while you are in the park. Dont miss the shows and plan your walk around the park accordingly.

You would need 3-5 hours in the park to really cover all the zones and see the shows along the route.

Food in the park isn't great and you must consider carrying some basic food. Particularly Vegetarians.

Elderly will find it difficult to walk and should opt for the electric carts. Call Jurong Bird Park before you book for senior citizens and ensure they are comfortable.

Hope this helps.

Watched the shows and we simply loved both shows. Especially the High flyers show. We watched both the 11 and 3pm show.
Both the presenters did an awesome job. Managed to see different kinds of birds compared from the 11am and 3pm such as the hornbill part.
My kids had too many questions that they went down to ask the presenter. Both the ladies( couldn’t remember their names. Oops) were very patient and answered my children’s ridiculous questions in a kiddy way. Will definitely recommend the bird park and the High flyers show.

Marmosets are about 20 centimetres (8 in) long and are native to South America and have been found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru. They have also been spotted in Central America and Mexico. Marmosets are highly active, living in the upper canopy of forest trees.
The tamarins are squirrel-sized monkeys and their body size ranges from 13 to 30 cm (5.1 to 11.8 in) (plus a 25-to-44 cm-long (9.8-to-17.3 in) tail). Tamarins are native to Southern Central America.

Me along with my family spent very nice time there. This is a family-friendly adventure among various bird species. The entry area is very colorful & beautiful which creates a very positive reaction among the visitors. We took the Panorail for a panoramic look at the bird park. It took long to get into as presence of tourists was huge. The Panorail travels through the park divided into different zones each facilitates with tram station. But walking through pathway is more appropriate to explore the aviary. It is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. There is a huge waterfall which adds different flavor really.

The most memorable part is the Birds & Buddies show which runs twice a day and features characters in colorful costumes. 11 am is the most suitable time. Kids enjoyed a lot. The host of the show Ms. Durga is such expert that she can control the the trained birds while presenting them at a wide pavilion to give super fun to the visitors.

We also fed the birds with foods provided by park authority & birds were found very usual to be seated on our hands in a flock. Another most important part is the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. My kids enjoyed penguins very much. They took some pictures with them.

they also have a really tall human-made waterfall inside the park with the upper walking area, which let you get closer to the birds. some of the free-flying birds are sooo use to humans, that they don't even bother to fly away like the birds we find back at home; in fact, they comfortably walk around and fly off when they feel like. some birds even gives you perfect poses!
like in the zoo, each category of birds have it's own museum sort area and they have really educating bird shows as well. it can get really tiring, so always carry something cool and water with you. also don't forget to take the advantage of their tramp ride... you going to need it!
this a very family experience which can take from good 4-6hrs.. better not schedule anything else till night, because it can get very tiring. Also, go early as possible :)
There is no straight MRT stop. you need to get down from Boon Lay and then get 194.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:33:01.890387

,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/MadhulikaL4,557649503,01-02-2018,4,Birds of different feathers flock together,"One of Singapore’s major wildlife parks, the Jurong Bird Park is a must-see if you’re at all fond of bird life. Set across many acres of well-wooded landscape, with lots of towering trees, water bodies and aviaries of different types and sizes, the bird park gives you a real bird’s eye view of the world’s avifauna. A road (flanked on both sides by beautiful heliconia shrubs with vivid red and yellow flowers) marks the route right through the park, and trams travel along these, stopping at designated tram stops along the way to allow hop-on hop-off travel. There are secondary pathways that you can traverse only on foot.

Among the most intriguing and spectacular sections we saw were the ones that allow visitors to get up close to the birds: the aviaries where you walk right in. The raptors, hornbills, toucans, birds of paradise, parrots, etc are all in cages (all very large, rest assured), but the pelicans and the flamingoes are out in the open on lakes, and two massive aviaries—the Lory Loft (which houses about a thousand lorikeets) and the Waterfall Aviary (the highlight of which is a 35 mt high waterfall)—allow you to really cross paths with some lovely birds. We oohed and aahed over gorgeous crowned pigeons, brilliantly coloured finches, parrots, macaws, peafowl, and more, watched them feeding just an arm’s length away, and got a chance to see many species we’d never even heard about before.

One of the most informative sections is the Bird Discovery Centre, a small and compact space that, across a handful of rooms, uses text, pictures, stuffed specimens and more to explain birds: their beaks, their bodies, their feeding and reproduction, human inventions inspired by birds, and more.

There is also a children’s play area that is bird-themed (we couldn’t visit this because, due to some corporate function, the park shut early on the day we visited). There are also various souvenir shops, eateries, toilets, etc dotted across the park. Do remember to pick up a park map and brochure (available free at the entrance), which also includes a comprehensive listing of feeding times for different birds—it’s a good way of getting to see them—as well as the timings for different shows at the park.

The only show we were able to go to was the High Flyers one, which showcases some interesting skills—flying/manoeuvring, dexterity, vocal mimicry, etc by an array of birds such as parrots, hornbills, and so on. Our toddler, whose fourth birthday it was in the day we visited, was absolutely thrilled that the parrot on the compere’s wrist actually sang ‘Happy birthday to you’ to all those in the audience (including, of course, our daughter) who were celebrating their birthday on that day. The show ended with a delightful grand finale consisting of dozens of birds of different species waddling into the amphitheatre and filling it with sound and colour.

We loved this place. The only drawback of it being a rainy day (it drizzled throughout, in varying intensity) was that since about 95% of the birds are out in the open (even the aviaries are covered in the top only by mesh), you get wet if you aren’t carrying an umbrella or wearing a raincoat. Either way, taking photos gets a bit difficult.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-29 17:33:11.928347

We were staying at the Westin in the financial district, there is public transportation out to the park, but we took Uber both ways (Uber is a great option in Singapore it was under $20 each way and took 20-25 minutes). Highlights are the 11a bird show, the new Parrot Paradise exhibit (largest exhibit of Macaws in Asia including 3 types of rare blue macaws), and the Lorikeets exhibit which is huge and amazing). There were many other great exhibits as well, this is definitely a venue you should consider if traveling to Singapore.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:33:47.019173

However, you must like birds or it is a waste of time. Go in the morning when it is cool. Take note of the times of the shows. If you go in the morning, you can see the shows that you missed in morning. Shows are repeated in the afternoon. If it rains, shows are cancelled. Take the tram ride though it costs some money.

We took the tram to go to around the park, which was not necessary as the park is fairly small and can be easily covered on foot. Parrot Paradise is the first stop and is absolutely awesome. It houses the largest parrot collection in Asia. I have never seen so many colorful parrots in my life and have never been so close to those beautiful creatures. My son went in with a juice bottle bought from the bird park and a little parrot flew straight onto the bottle and tried to get the juice out. So we ended up with quite a few hilarious pictures.

The bird shows are a must-see, especially the High Flyer Show in the Pools Amphitheatre. It is packed with amazing performances and the interaction with audiences is excellent. One of the parrots can sing and count in different languages, totally unbelievable!

The children’s water playground is my son’s favorite. If we lived nearby, he would definitely want to buy an annual pass and come every day. Next to the playground is a restaurant with a room, where parents can have a break when the kids having fun in the water park. The water playground has safe guards on duty, therefore is very safe.

The only issue I had with the bird park was the demonstration times announced on the tram and displayed on the posters along the road did not match. It was confusing and we missed a pelican feeding session because of that. I think there must be timetables for daily shows/demonstrations at the ticket office, but we were not given any.

Only downsides were that there arent many places to eat inside, only a small cafe kind of thing at the lory loft, the rest we could find were stalls. Let’s be honest, the stalls are overpriced. We also had brought park hopper tickets to go to night safari after, so the tickets in my inbox were in the order of BP,NS,BP,NS etc. Instead of scanning all the bird park tickets, he just scanned the first 5, which included a few of our night safari tickets. When I asked him, he just waved me off and said it didn’t matter. Well it did, we got held up by the night safari staff who couldn’t understand what we were saying and ended being late to one of the shows, missing the whole thing pretty much.

And when further rejected, he said 5 for $50. What is the actual price?? My dad did buy finally but That’s not the kind of attitude I expect of a kids attraction at SG. If u want to build memories, take the pictures of happy guests who love nature and animals, post them on your Facebook and not just think of making quick bucks.

3. Food selection was very limited. Apart from hawk cafe outside (ridiculous pricing) there’s nothing much inside. At least zoo had kfc near the kids play area where parents & kids could grab a seat/ quick bite.

Be sure to take the tram tickets as that will save you a lot of walking, you can use it multiple times and every tram stop is where most of the to do things are.

Larry loft is amazing and do take the feeding cups for 3SGD, the birds will flock onto your hands/ arms to feed & its totally worth it, next I would suggest visiting Waterfall Aviary.

The upkeep of the park is impeccable. If you do not like walking for long periods of time, the tram ride is strongly recommended. But there has to be a better way to check if everyone availing the tram ride has actually paid for it. The tram driver (who doubles as a conductor), at every stop, will check your ticket.

The overall experience was grand and we managed to watch only the Birds of Prey show which was quite enjoyable. The complete experience of the park will consume at least 6 hours of your time.

Due to maintenance work one of the exhibits was closed to tourists. As a gesture of goodwill and courtesy, the management could have gone the extra mile and refunded a part of the entry fee to all tourists who visited the park that day.

It is a place for people who love birds, that is it. Perhaps, it is one of the only bird parks around in the world but then, does it make sense to cage so many birds. Anyways, the highlight of the park are the 2 live events that they have - Kings of the Skies and High Fliers Show. Do check the timings of these events before you step in to the park. They are worth watching (heck, looks like they are the only ones worth watching).
Also, there is a small water play area around in the Jurong Bird Park which kids might love to splash around. It does tend to get a bit monotonous and with so much walking around, kids might enjoy in the water play area, so do remember to take your children's water clothes and a new set of change clothes if they want to go in the water play area. It is nothing fancy but then, getting wet with couple of slides is so much fun for the kids.

There is a single bus that travels from the Boon Lay MRT that goes to the Jurong Bird Park, right up to its gate, Bus No. 194. You need to get down at Boon Lay MRT and take the Exit D and go to the Boon Lay Interchange where in there are numerous stops for various buses with Bus No. 194 at one end for Jurong Bird Park. While coming back, you just need to get out of the Jurong Bird Park, cross the road, under the flyover and get on the other side and take the same bus to reach Boon Lay MRT.

Bus service in Singapore is awesome and it is worth the money one pays for.

Just do remember to buy an EZ Link Card the day you step in to Singapore - it costs about SGD 12 (SGD 5 for the card and SGD 7 for usage). But boy is this card helpful - any bus, MRT you can just tap in and tap out. No need to fish for change and ask for how much is it to travel to the destination. You can top it out at any of the MRT so you are good to go. Alternatively, ask the hotel you are staying at, whether they can provide you with a used EZ Link card - that way you can save that SGD 5 of the cost of the card too.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:34:59.985214

We spent a day at Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari the day before from 11.30am - 10pm. The next day we took Uber to Jurong Bird Park, half hour from our hotel in Tyrwhitt Road.

We arrived around noon. After walking all day yesterday, we opted for the tram, it took us around the park, easiest way to see whole Jurong Bird Park.
The air-con enclosure of Penguin Coast was a welcome to Singapore's humid weather. We checked out the Waterfall Aviary with its suspension bridge and a 30-metre high waterfall, all birds roamed free in there.
The Flamingo Pool was amazing. We cooled down in the Breeding and Research Centre's air-cond room! And of course if you were travelling with the wee ones, splashed around at Birdz of Play.

Our favourite was the High Flyers Show at the Pools Amphitheatre (11am and 3pm).

Food were expensive just like the other three parks. Westgate mall would be cheaper option for food. Westgate, JEM and Big Box were three connected malls about 10 minutes ride by Uber.

Wifi at the park enable us to book Uber to I'm Startice - Korean Premium Shop at Big Box shopping mall at the end of the day.

The bird park opens early and we could easily spent 4-5 hrs at the park before heading to the airport. We had fun feeding the colorful lorries (birds) at the Lorry loft.. We saw many hornbills and tucans flying around in their chambers. The African penguins swimming and feeding was a sight to watch. There are multiple shows that occur at different locations within the park and one can enjoy these to learn more about various birds and their habitat. We had an opportunity to enjoy ""Kings of the Sky"" show that spoke about vultures, eagles, hawks and ospreys. It was a brilliant show.

There is a tram that takes you around the park and stops at 3 different locations to ease mobility for the tourist. You need to buy a separate ticket for that if not included in the entrance ticket.

The park is expansive, beautiful in the middle of hillocks and the flora is thick and that of a rain forest. Many of the plant species we'd encountered in the Indian Subcontinent, but many many others were exclusive and such a treat.

There were birds from all across ... for me, stand outs were the flaming pink flamingos, the birds of prey - not having had the opportunity to meet the himalayan vultures so close at hand! The butterfly park and the museum is engrossing if that's your thing - I dallied there forever.

There's even an iguana you can touch and feel - skip it if you're not a reptile person!
I did not get over my fear of being around reptiles at close quarters.

The shows are exceptional - especially the one on birds of prey - its a treat to watch the keepers' and their wards work in such close unison!

1. Tram is totally waste of money and useless - its a multi bogey fossil fuel driven belching unburnt fuel smell, which has like 3 stops which are useless as you have to walk to each enclosure. They should learn from Delhi zoo, where battery driven single bogey tram continuously move around so you visit one enclosure and then can catch the next one to go farther.
2. there are few trams, so you wait endlessly for one to come, and after the shows or on crowded days, this is quite painful
3. the strollers provided are not ergonomical nor shaded, they should check with Universal studios, as rental charge is almost same",09-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:35:34.332941

You'll surely be amazed by the colors and beauty of the birds in the park ... birds of paradise, hawks, flamingos, parrots, emus, swans, penguins, and much much more!

Aside from a wonderful display of birds, there are also regular shows in the park (like the High Fliers show, the Kings of the Skies, etc.). You also have a chance to feed some of the birds or have your photos taken with them. If you get hungry, just go to one of the eateries in the park (like Pizza Hut).

Jurong Bird Park is fun for both adults and kids. In fact, they have a dry and wet play zone area called the ""Birdz of Play"" for children. For souvenir, drop by the park's gift shop.

However a day was to be had at the Jurong Bird Park as my significant other wanted to go there and also our child to see the birds as well whilst in Singapore for holidays.

The first part of the day was very humid and we spent time walking to see the flamingos, followed by Pelican cove and swan lake We stopped at Waterfall Cafe and whilst I recovered from the steamy day in the cool of the cafe the more energetic went up the stairs to the viewing platform. They told me it was good.

I believe we had lunch at Songbird Terrace where our friend and child left us after eating in the a/c little cafe. Not much seating here when very busy. Little shop located at the other end of the rectangular shaped area where cafe located had some good gifts but on the higher side of pricing, but at least I could see the staff were happy and obviously the money would go to the upkeep of the animals health etc. We purchased some stuffed toys to take home with us and give as gift for friend's child at school (she was thrilled with the bird we purchased incidentally). The toys seemed well made.

By the time we got around near Window on Paradise, we decided to go back to the main entrance after that as we were near the end, however we made the choice to see the toucans and Hornbills located just to the side of the road/walkway. This proved a difficulty to get back as just before we could walk back to the main cover the skies opened up and it rained heavily. The cover we did find nearly met it's match in terms of water on the ground as the water from the rain was almost torrential! However what an experience to watch the rain come down like that and it was just us there, there was a lot of thunder and lightning but we were safe. After what seemed like a fairly long time we managed to get back to one of the tram stops with an umbrella we had in lighter rain.

However we had been going the wrong way on the pathway and would need to go back around the track, virtually around the whole park. However before too long a staff member appeared in a golf cart style vehicle and asked us if we wanted to go back to the entry/exit?! He even apologised for the vehicle not being totally covered up. At this stage I didn't care but it was covered over our heads. In reality as long as it had four wheels and a steering wheel to get us back I didn't mind. I was exhausted from the day as we had walked in the heat which was our own choice as the attractions are fairly close and paved to each other. I asked how much was the lift back to the entry/exit and he said it was at no cost and the park realised that there is not much cover in rain weather. Joseph was the staff member's name and he was extremely polite and friendly to us. I wish to specially commend Joseph in his appearing at just the right moment and his super polite manner. In the end it made a difference to how we felt at the end of the day after being rather exhausted and our child wanting to go back to the hotel.

The kind park staff who directed us around the water that had slightly flooded in the pathway to the entry/exit. They made sure we went the right way to get out and that we didn't get lost in my haze of tiredness.

Once again the Singaporeans have been very kind and giving. They made us very welcome wherever we went like friends. Thank you Jurong Bird Park and staff.

There is a few really good photo opportunities, one is near the Pelican Cove were there is an outdoor gazebo. However take mosquito repellant for around this area or you will get bitten. Especially for small children who may react to the bites.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:35:35.511413

Now some practical stuff:
1) In case you tend to use MRT, come to Boon Lay station, head straight towards the bus terminal on the ground floor and ask for the bus number (i forget now), its 15 minutes then. So if are a group and not on tight budget, might as well as take a cab!
2) Jurong Bird park and Night safari are two different places. First thing, you should ask is when the bus departs from Bird Park to the Jurong Night Safari. We did not ask as we did not know nor was there any board which says the two are different. Hence we missed the 5 pm bus and instead took the cab",08-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:35:54.889584

The zoo was very spread out so you had to walk long ways till you saw something and felt bit lonely in parts- the kids were hot and found it bit hard going.
the only good part was the lorikeet enclosure but the variety in here was not great - they had a few friendly vareitys of lorikeets birds but some of the rainbow lorikeets were bit testy and angry..
was a lovely enclosure but having a good vast variety of birds everywhere would be a brilliant tourist attraction. looking forward to seeing the new location.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:36:29.102767

Try to get to the park by 8:30 or so, we could see only the High Flyers' show and missed the other one. The high flyers' show, lasting for about 30 mins, was excellent, to say the least! The park has a vast collection of birds in their natural habitats. Do visit the aviary loft & parrot paradise... The park however requires quite a bit of walking and you may wish to rent a stroller for the entire day at SGD 9 for your kid. You can also explore the park by tram, though you would miss out on viewing more than half the collection if you choose the tram. There's a pizza hut too inside the park!

The park is organized by sections, depending by the kind of birds. Its size is quite extensive, so if you go with young children, I suggest you take the tram ride. Also dont forget your sunblock!!

It is a great park, even for adults.

I gave the park a 3 stars because it lacks of dining option. When we visited the park, the only option is only at the entrance of the park, or the buffet option inside the park.

The fact that a restaurant is located at the entrance minimized you to dine at you own convenient time, either you eat before or after you tour the park, although this dining place have good selections.

The buffet option however give yourself the convenient timing to dine according to your liking, it also have option for dinining with bird show, which is fun for the children. But the food in this place is really bad, food is bland, selection is limited. Fruit, ice cream, and coffee is available.

Many many different types and varieties of birds. Kept the kids entertained. Colourful birds too. Lory loft was temporarily closed when we visited so didn't get to enter to feed the birds or walk on the bridge there.

Kids spent the last part of the day at the Kidszone wet playground. Area had a dry and wet playground. Kids absolutely love the wet playground which has a huge bucket of water which would periodically pour down on them. The playground also has some youth employed by the park to play or look out for the kids.

Missed the bird shows as it was heavily raining in the afternoon. Few restaurants in the park and a kiosk operated by Pizza Hut. It's called Pizza Hut Express so they may not have a full menu. Can't say more since I didn't patronise the kiosk.

While looking for Easter Fun activities with kids, I spotted smuff Easter egg hunt happening at JBP.
We reached at around 11am, but car park is full(public holiday), we ended up having our lunch elsewhere and returning at 1pm. By then we are able to enter carpark.
We spent most of our time in queue, waiting and waiting. There's a big crowd for purchasing their entrance & tram tickets. We thought that's the only 1 that we have to wait. But no, we had to wait for tram(Long queue). And finally we hopped in to tram and its start to rain. We couldn't get off at any stations( our mistakes- no umbrella, no raincoat), this is a must! We return to main station and get our day pass converted to annual pass (promo pay $29 a day can convert to a year). And is such a mess system, we are required to queue again. After done rain stopped, and we queue again for tram! We reach smuff waterfall aviary station at 3:45pm. Reaching the activities station at 3:50pm, and being informed ""sorry that we are closed for the day"". Such a disappointment that they closed at 4pm and it's only happening for 3days. Waterfall aviary is beautiful, we enjoy our walk and scenery there. So far we visited penguin, parrot and we stranded at pelican cove( raining again). We have yet to watch any shows.

Confirm the timings on the day of your visit. The birds are well cared for and you can get really close to some of them. One disappointment was the parrots of paradise. Unlike my last visit when I could take pics with the birds on my shoulder, they are locked away now. There is talk of moving it to Singapore zoo but I love the current location though it is far from city center. Taxi line is long after the visit and this is something the authorities need to work on.

The cages are big enough to allow the birds to move about, though not nearly as big as they need. The problem with these cages are that the fences are dense, so dense that it's difficult to take pictures of the birds in the cages. You can see them, but when you try to take pictures, the fences become an interference.

The aviaries are a great place to get up-close-and-personal with birds. These are also good places to take pictures, if you are patient enough.

The museum displays are kind of boring, we felt.

We came here in the morning, soon after the park opened (at 8:30am, which is surprisingly early!) During the initial hours, the park is much less crowded, and we enjoyed being able to walk around unhurried, without noise from other visitors, and taking pictures without interference from other visitors. As more visitors showed up, the noise level went up (there were groups that were making so much noise that the birds were scared off), and taking pictures became harder.

Overall this is a park to visit once every few years. But do visit in the morning and on a weekday if you want less crowd.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:38:36.479069

We bought the tram tickets near the entrance. The tram turned out to be useful as it is a bit of work to walk the entire park, especially for senior citizens. The tram has convenient stops and makes the whole day more bearable.
We had decided to watch all the bird shows so our schedule was - penguin feeding, high flyers show, chat with hornbill, lorrie loft, aviary feeding, birds of prey. With this itinerary you need to go around the entire park only once. Lunch can be had at lorrie loft or there are numerous eateries throughout the park.
The park had an offer going on that day, wherein for S$50, you could take pictures at any location in the park and you'd be given all the soft copies. Turned out to be a good deal.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:38:37.497259

The children can play with water slides and other games. The high entrance fee ($29 for adults and $19 for children older than 3) is justified by the high standards of maintenance. You can rent a small cart to pull two young children at a time and/or take a train.

The show in the amphitheatre is exciting and well worth seeing. The large macaws were magnificent and the level of training demonstrated by staff was fantastic. Some of the most awesome birds from around the world that you may have heard of are here and the variety of parrots here is inspiring.

We seemed to have timed it well. We arrived at 10am and saw the park wardens feeding the Penguins. Then we went to sit in the outdoor arena and waited for the bird show to start at 11am. We had a good half hour wait and it was getting hot but thankfully the show arena was well shaded. The bird show was excellent. It kept the children and the adults engaged and was very educational as well as being fun. The children waited in a line at the end of the show to get a photograph with some Flamingos but this wasn't so great.
There rest of the park was lovely. We only spent 3 hours there in total so we chose to visit the Waterfall area and it was spectacular.

Unfortunately, the children's' water splash play area was closed the weekend we visited.
The main criticism I can think of is that it wouldn't be suitable for children younger than 3 as there seemed to be a lot of steps in some areas and not a lot of shade in many other areas either.

Overall though, an excellent visit and we look forward to returning soon.",01-2017,Family,2020-01-29 17:39:14.176690

It is very huge, clean and entertaining!

The shows were great. Feeding the birds is one of the activities that you must do - it's very fun, my kid loves it!

,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/PappanMajumdar,450868127,10-01-2017,5,This is a must if you have kids 6 years and above!!,"This was my second visit, but this time for the first time with my family including my 2 daughters - 6 and 14 years. For both of them, it was an experience of the beauty of nature. Its a must go for kids of this generation as we live in cities and it is impossible to be up close and personal with nature. And yes, at Jurong Bird Park you get to see Penguins!! That too in two different enclosures.

Jurong Bird Park is a little far off and is situated in Jurong Hill. So, you have to plan well to reach on time as the first bird show is at 10 am in the morning. We were staying near Dakota MRT and it took us more than an hour to reach the place. So, please plan well.

There are 3 shows in the morning back to back. The first show is at 10 am which is King of the Skies show. Well, this show is average, to be frank. So, if you want to skip any 1 show, this should be it, especially because its the first one in the morning and if you are running late, then don't fret. The 2nd activity is Penguin Feeding at the Penguin Coast. This is a must attend. First, watch the staff feeding and giving a short discourse on feeding. And then the best part is that you also get to feed the penguins by buying fish for 2 SGD and offering to the ever ready to eat Penguins. It is a lovely experience. Then comes the best show @ Jurong - High Flyers Show. HIGH FLYERS SHOW IS A MUST WATCH. In fact, you should visit Jurong only for this show. Please do see this especially if you have kids. It is really fascinating.

After the 3 back to back shows in the morning, my recommendation is to take the park tram which is not very expensive. It gives you a leisurely ride across the bird park with stops like the Lory Loft and Waterfall Aviary. Do stop over at these places and experience birds in nature. The way they have housed the birds are fascinating. You know for sure that the birds don't feel as if they are in captivity. Waterfall Aviary features the highest manmade waterfall. It is a good place to get pics clicked. So, I would recommend the tram ride. Though we didn't choose to walk around at all, the tram ride will give you the ability to get down at the designated stops and walk around at your own will to see birds of all kinds. And then whenever required you could hop on back to an upcoming tram at any of the designated stops. Kudos to the organisers for this tram arrangement.

Tips/info/things which I experienced:

- If you are using public transport. There are 2 bus stops near Jurong. One is very near (5 minutes walk), the other is little far (15 minutes walk). So, keep this in mind in case you get down on the further bus stand and you have to walk 15 minutes to walk it to reach the place. By MRT, you have to reach Boon Lay MRT on the East West Line. From Boon Lay MRT you need to go to the huge Bus terminus right next to the MRT station and take a bus. Please look up streetdirectory.com for the details.
- I did online booking from the Wildlife Reserves Singapore website. Here you get the option of booking for 4 activities - Jurong Bird Park, River Safari, Night Safari and Singapore Zoo. The more activities you book the more discount you get. I booked for only Jurong and Night Safari. For Jurong, you get the flexibility of visiting on any day for a week. For Night Safari there is a fixed date and time. Though I didn't do the River Safari and Singapore Zoo (I thought of an overdose of wildlife activities), I heard that the River Safari is a good activity. So, do check up on that and see if you want to visit that
- Well, if it rains then I don't know what happens to the shows. Both King of the Skies and High Flyers shows are in the open. So, I guess that the shows get cancelled. Do check on that. If you use the tram then you don't need umbrellas. But, if you do have umbrellas or ponchos then do carry with you to the park as it is largely an open-air activity. We were lucky as we didn't get any rain.
- The bird shows have a morning and an afternoon schedule. So, very simply Jurong Bird Park warrants either a visit from morning till afternoon or from afternoon to evening. So, in total you would roughly require minimum 3 hours here.
- There are not too many eating options here. There is a Pizza Hut and then there are few eateries like Bongo Burgers, etc. And there are no nearby places to eat as it is in a secluded forest area. So, please do not plan to eat elsewhere. If you need to eat then plan to eat at the park from the available options.

To summarise, Jurong Bird Park is a great place and is worth every buck you spend. It is situated at a secluded place which is a forest area. So, you get a nice feeling of going away from the city life and into the wild forest area and then you see the lovely birds almost as if they are in their natural surroundings. A very quiet park with lots of things to see and experience. The staff here is very efficient and courteous. All activities are very well organised and you will surely have a great experience here.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:39:22.132644
,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Ups-up,450450677,08-01-2017,5,Fabulous time at Jurong Bird Park,"Jurong Bird Park, Singapore is one of the most renowned bird sanctuaries with some of the largest free-flying aviaries in the world. Management of the Jurong Bird Park has taken all the steps to provide habitats that mirror their naturalistic environments which spreads over 20.2 hectares of exploratory landscape. Bird Park opening hours are from 8.30am to 6.00pm.

It is advisable to visit the park early in the morning as they have suggested a great itinerary to explore the park where you won’t miss any of the key events for the day. Bird shows are highlights at the park. Check out their show schedule before you start the journey. There are three of them (1) Kings of the Skies Show at Hawk Arena, (2) High Flyers Show, Pools Amphitheatre and (3) Lunch with Parrots at Songbird Terrace.

If you get tired of walking inside the park, you can explore the park at a more relaxed way on their tram rides.

If you are visiting with children, at park entrance you can rent wagons to pull your toddlers around. It would especially useful for the little ones who get tired easily. Also, available renting strollers for infants and toddlers and wheelchairs available free-of-charge for guests with special needs.

During your journey if you are with children, don't forget to visit the Birdz of Play to splash in and get wild and wonderfully wet in it’s fun wonderland. Don’t forget to take an extra set of clothes for the family. Even if you forgot do not fear, you can purchase swimwear and lovely T-shirts at the nearby gift shop.

I guarantee no matter what your age you will get an amazing time to spend at Jurong Bird Park, Singapore. Keep the full day to visit this place.",02-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:39:22.565150

Several reasons contributed to this rating:

a. The place is squalid, and a lot needs to be done to 'improve' the cleanliness- not just the environs, but also the cages where the poor birds thrive

b. We purchased tickets with tram, and hopped on a tram which stopped as a result of a technical failure. This was further exacerbated by the fact that we were refused boarding to hop on another tram.

c. Most of the caged birds were truly 'distressed'- hope someone does take notice !

Make sure you get there early so that you can see the birds of flight shows. If you have trouble walking distances pay $5 to catch the small tram that travels around the park. However it only stops at set locations so have a look when you first enter the park to work out when to get off etc as there is some hills which may be ok for walking down but not so easy coming back up. Make sure you don't miss the penguin display which is an inside attraction. Really cute where you can watch them swimming and just standing around looking at each other. You can walk through some of the cages which is also really good.,12-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:39:51.169320

Our favorite was the Lorry feeding where we fed the birds and they sat on our hands, shoulders and even head!! Among the shows, high flyers show was wonderful. We enjoyed the birds of prey show too.

You can carry food and water inside; though there are water dispensers around. There are a few eateries inside and to our surprise; one had biryani too. Both veg and non-veg biryani were decent (~10 SGD) and the quality was large.

We took a cab to go there because we didn't want to spend time travelling on metro (it would have taken 1.5hrs from Little India after changing lines twice and taking a bus).

Please note that there are lots of male strangers in the play area, so it's not good for girls, especially older girls, to be topless. I'm highlighting this because everyone just associates the Bird Park with birds (naturally) but when kids see the water play area, they will definitely want to head in.

This bird park had been around for more than 45 years and it's showing ... though you can tell a lot of effort still goes to the feather friends to maintain an enjoyable visit. Also u can tell there have been constant upgrading to upkeep the interest of this place. The two shows are alright, some parts are actually quite impressive but pale in comparison to the zoo and night safari. Also little interactive between the birds and visitors. The children water play and playground are loads of fun so do plan extra time. We went at 2pm, watch the two shows, spent an hour in the water play and left with very little time to explore and understand the birds. The park closes at 6pm. Looking forward to the move to Mandai, u can bet it will be exciting. So come back in 2020!",10-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:40:36.135705

You get at discounted price and quite flexible too.

Reaching Jurong park- Suggest to use MRT and Bus combination, quite economic and easy to reach. Taxi would have costed me 30 $ one way, however i spent 5 $ by
MRT and Bus combination and reached the destination in less than 45 minutes.

Nearest attraction near Jurong Bird park- Science center.

Jurong bird park is well maintained bird park with lot of customer friendly facilities, excellent infrastructure, and lots of activities which are thought provocative.
Once you reach park, I suggest you to take a tram ride to understand the geography of the park and shortlist the attractions you would like to focus.
Please go through the activities list and plan your activities in the park.You could walk at leisure and enjoy hopping tram ride to various attractions. Don't miss Wings of Asia, which is very nice and the guide will explain neatly at free of cost.
Food in the park is bit expensive, which is norm in all tourist attractions.
This is in total 3-4 hours activity. Please reach latest by 9 am to park and spend time till 1pm and have lunch to proceed to science center which is 15 minutes drive from taxi at aorund 8-10 $ or by Bus/MRT around 2 $ which takes around 45 minutes.

And easy to reach via public transportation.,"We had visited maybe 15+ years ago and again last week- it's more incredible than ever. The grounds are Gorgeous, and our feathered friends really shine here- stunning photo opportunities. We chose to ride the tram (its $5 Singapore/ (about $3,70U.S.) and a great overview to see the sheer vastness of this place and to give you an idea of how to pace your stay and proximity to the 2 shows- both of which are not to be missed. They had not had the waterpark for kids before so unfortunately we did not have swimwear for our grandson with us but its a huge area and looked amazing (included). Our 6 yr old was dying to go again while we were in Singapore, he loved feeding the lories and every bit of his time here.
Very easy to do on your own, its about 30 min out of town- its a huge area, and easy to take the East West MRT (green line) to the Boon Lay station (EW27). I believe you can actually exit into the bus interchange but we did not spot the sign and came out at street level right on the corner. The Bus #194 is right across the street in the back of the mall. Just go IN the mall (not around it)- tons of buses depart from here and there are permanent lines for each- and signs to let you know when the next one is departing. Since the bus originated here we only waited maybe 6 min and everyone got a seat.
When we went the 1st time the bus stopped right in the parking lot so we were not watching as diligently as we should have, it stops on the street now about a half block before the entrance. Fortunately the Singaporean people are beyond kind and we obviously looked like tourists- camera and go pro were probably a good hint :0). They asked if we were headed for Jurong and the driver paused long enough for us to bolt off, but it was maybe 15 min bus ride. For the return, this was a one way street, if you walk through the covered arch to the street heading in the other direction- you will see the bus stop for the return- could not have been easier. We had the day to spend as much time as we wanted. Definitely one of our favorite things to do in Singapore- we were a family from age 6 to 77.

There are some very good exhibits like the waterfall aviary and the pelican grove but the lory loft and penguin coast were a let down. The Penguins reminiscent of a scene in Happy Feet stuck behind a glass window was rather boring and the lory loft was saturated by far too many people. Like most attractions in the world, visit this place during the week to get the best experience.
The aviary waterfall was amazing and peaceful, also the birds inside were very colourful. There is another exhibit called Jungle Jewels, that is worth visiting too and much more to look at than the lory flora and fauna was exemplary too, lots of lovely trees and flowers to look at and take pictures of.
Overall the place is clean and tidy but the exhibits could, or should, be more spacious for bigger birds. Staff are very friendly, like most of Singapore, and could find smiles out of the grumpiest people.

Took a taxi ride from Little India which cost 20 SGD - 25 mins. The attraction is reasonable priced at 29 SGD for adults and 19 SGD for children.

Recommend getting there early to avoid the unbearable heat off the afternoon. Must dos:--

1. Lorry Loft - The MAIN attraction - Simply loved feeding the Lorry's honey in the Lorry Loft. Very well constructed and a massive collection of Lorikeets. Great opportunities to take photos - they are so colourful and pretty!

2. Waterfall Aviary - Another very well contracted area with a huge waterfall and flying birds which makes it an experience to cherish

3. Parrots Paradise - Great collection of Macaw's (simply love them), different coloured parrots/ Lorikeets. Enjoy!!

4. The two birds show are definitely not to be missed - Enjoyed the High Flyers show more than the King of the Skies Show but both worth watching. How they train these birds is amazing. Get a seat in the middle rows in the High Flyers show and you will get a chance to participate in the fun….

Drink plenty of water/ cold drinks to keep hydrated during the day. The Bird park itself will take around 4-5 hours.

Improvements however need to be made to the provision of taxis from the bird park at the end of the day. Had to wait 40 mins for a taxi as taxi drivers don't like coming to this part..Eventually this site will be closed and the Bird Park will be moved closer to the Zoo but until then the park authorities need to sort this issue out",08-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:41:30.039815

Definitely pay extra for the train ride as it goes around most of the park and is very scenic. We also had a great time at the Birdz of Play area with our 2yo son-such a welcome break from the heat!

If you love birds, you will find every type of bird imaginable here and it's a lovely setting. For us, half a day was enough to see the shows, our favourite birds and play at the waterplay area.

The bus ride was easy.
We ended up taking family pictures as soon as we entered the park. If you do this be sure to ask for different photos (Ex family, parents only, kids only, etc) and ask for the digital copy of the pictures. The park itself was easy to navigate. We missed the first bird show so we hopped on the tram. As we went around the park the driver stopped and told everyone to get off. We were confused, but then he explained that we missed the bird show so we should go into the Lorry Loft while it was not crowded. That was the best advice we could have gotten. We ended up buying 4 cups of the bird food and taking lots of fabulous pictures with the birds. They were all over kids.
We walked around the rest of the park. It was really interesting to read and learn about the birds.
Lots of clean bathrooms spaced around the park. Waterfall Station was outrageously beautiful. Funny-we saw another family eating the same chicken rice packets here!
They have a water play area for kids. They also have an air conditioned room here if you need to get out of the heat.

Loved the large aviaries where birds are flying freely over your head. Saw a few shows which were great, if only to see the birds in full flight. It's a well-organized place, like its sister parks, and easy to navigate. Also like the other parks, the food options inside the park are expensive and probably mediocre in quality, so if you can plan for it, bring lunch (we bought sushi and bento boxes from the ""Japanese Street"" area of the mall (B1 level) where you make the change from the MRT at Boon Lay station to the bus (bus 194)). Taking public transport there could not be easier - at Boon Lay, you follow signs for the bus interchange, which is right through the mall, and then the bus lines are clearly marked.
There is also a water play area for children which is really nice - has a large play structure with slides, spouts, tipping buckets of water, etc. Great way to relax after a long, hot day. Bring bathing suits for this. It's included in the ticket.
We happened to accidentally leave one of our cameras at the park, and miraculously, it showed up at the member services area. We called ahead of time, found out it was there, and picked it up, overjoyed to have retrieved the photos we had taken. Spoke volumes about the excellent service and organization of the place.

Tips:
1. Bring bottled water and refill near the bathrooms. Having actual water refilling stations would be good, and would be in keeping of the Reduce, Reuse, Recycle theme. Plus, water is $2 a bottle there.
2. Bring lunch and some snacks
3. Take public transport, which is easy and comfortable

But I must say that I was dead wrong. I thought the small birds would be far away and unattractive to a young child, but the enclosures were actually well-planned for ease of viewing. Stand-out attractions like the Lory Loft were of great interest to my kid (and me) too. I loved the interactivity of some of their attractions, e.g. penguin feeding (you can donate S$2 to get a tray of small fish to feed the penguins, and even my rather-cautious kid enjoyed it) and lory feeding (again, you pay to get a bowl of nectar mix) - it really engaged the child and the child-in-me. The bird shows are not to be missed. I would put this way up above the River Safari for a young child.

Park space, though small, was well utilised, with many exhibits presented nicely. Do not underestimate the size of the park: there are actually many exhibits to cover amongst the hidden pathways! Over so many years (last I visited was over 10 years ago), much of the flora and fauna have matured, lending a natural touch to the park's atmosphere.

My gripe is that the park is not easily accessible, and that ticket prices are not actually attractive enough to encourage repeated visits, especially for locals. Its a pity that the monorail could not be retained. I could see that the stations have been repurposed though.

Overall, it was a nostalgic visit that allowed me to relive my childhood days. Good for a one off visit, but it will be a while before I return again.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:42:05.579470

If you can't go to Antartica to meet the Penguins then this is the place. It has some fantastic varieties of birds and in separate sections. There is a small train that is available for the lazy ones or people who has taken the group tour option but this is not a place for it. Instead Take a walk and spend time at each section. The most time I spent was at the Predatory Birds. My daughter loves them. If you are with your kids then it would be advisable to carry pen and small writing pad in case they want to jot down something. Though all the info can be googled but the experience of watching them live and taking notes is fun, believe me you won't repent it. The work that has gone into creating the artificial habitat is really commendable.

So it should not come as a surprise that I will be gushing about this place throughout the review.

Location:
Reaching Jurong Bird park is not difficult. However, being located on the outskirts of the city, it requires at least 1.5 hours to reach if you are using MRT and bus service. Simply follow the instructions on the website on how to reach there and you will be fine.

Tickets:
We purchased the park hopper package, which included entry for Jurong Bird Park, River Cruise, Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, which costed us SGD62. I will strongly urge everyone to do the same, as this package is discounted compared to individual tickets (even if you plan on going to two locations, it still works out cheaper)

Zoo Premises:
Zoo itself is vast and large, with a tropical setting. It gets hot and humid during afternoons. Wear light clothes. To go around, you can either walk, or use the tram services, which cost around SGD10 for 2 people. Once you enter, a bunch of noisy parrots greets you, raising all sorts of hell, chattering really loud. For me, their noises were pure music. They sit on a perch with trainers and visitors are encouraged to take pictures with them. You can't have one on your shoulder or anything, but you can hold a branch on which several of these birds are perched. You will also have those red plumed macaws around, but you can't interact with them because they are not used to different people touching them. Once you take the pictures, you can buy them from nearby kiosk at an exorbitant price. That was real money gouging tactic employed by the management of all the zoos in Singapore. We gave it a pass.
There are several enclosures housing amazing exotic birds. My favorite ones were Birds of Paradise and Parrot and macaws enclosures. The zookeepers seem to take great care of the birds and have great love and respect for them.
Zoo also has one of the largest Aviaries in the world, which houses the most talkative of birds I have seen - Lories! You can buy a sugar solution for SGD3 and feed these amazing birds as they perch near you or on you! I enjoyed every waking moment in that place and my wife had to throw a tantrum to get me out of it.
For me, the high point of the visit was the High Flyers show, where i got to interact with a bird when it flew up from its trainer, took a SGD50 note from my palm and flew back to its trainer (money was of course returned by the same bird!) That incident was one of the best moments of my life! The King of the Skies show should also not be missed.

Make sure that you spend an entire day at this amazing place. Anything less, and you are not doing yourself any justice.

Also, if you are on a tight budget, make sure that you come to the place stocked with a few supplies - like water bottles and some food / snacks like sandwiches. The water is upwards of SGD3 (500ml only) and a quick bite for a single person will easily be SGD15. You will find a couple of places in the park where you can stock up on your water supplies, but it won't appear on the map. Ask someone from the staff. One place I definitely remember is the Waterfall Aviary.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:42:51.340641

Feeling so small around all the majestic and colorful spp of birds, never a dull moment.

Truly a wonderful paradise, would be a pity to shift the Bird Park to Mandai when the existing one is so awesome.
The birds are awesome, the show was great, the scenery was amazing with all the landscapes enhancing the whole park.

Everything is so peaceful and grand.

We felt like we have really stepped into the the dinosaur era when we were at the Dino Descendants aviary.

A small letdown was when we realized many guests actually ride the tram for free because no one was checking on them.
It was unfair for those like us who bought it at $5.

Hopefully the management can look into this issue.

Overall an amazing paradise where we will be revisiting again and again!

The larger, walk-in aviaries allow you to feed and get right up close to the birds.

Some of the other aviaries could stand to be a bit bigger though.

Go in the morning, as the feeding trays are removed about an hour before closing time, so it will be harder to see the birds.

There you can have a personal parrot show while you lunch. They offered chicken, fish, some kind of veg ...fruits, ice creams etc. There you can get that much advertised photo of parrot sitting on your hand. There is one small platform...Lorry loft... where you buy some bird feed for 3S$ and feed the small birds. Be sure to reach there early otherwise these small birds don't come near you once they are full. Children do enjoy it very much.

TIckets: I strongly suggest you buy them online, there is a 4 park hopper which we purchased. It saves a good deal of money & covers all the parks. Pay that additional $5 SGD for the tram ride, it's an saving grace from the long walks in an hot weather.

Experience: Fantastic. The park is very well maintained, the tram ride plays an audio of which side to look & what type of birds do you see. There are stations which you can hop on & off.
Bird feeding, I strongly recommend it. Buy the feeding cup & walk along the bridge, waive the cup & wait for a bird to come. The birds need to feel safe & trust you to come that close, most of them are very small and delicate. Keep your hand near the railing so that they can get some support to stand and dip their tiny tongue into the cup. It is a surreal experience of kindness & connect.
Rest of the experience is walk, observe, click & connect to nature.

Traveller Tip: a) If you have booked online, simply show the pdf ticket at the entrance for scanning. b) Check the weather for a 7 day period before you book, monsoon can be a bummer. Your tickets once booked are valid for 7 days from issue. c) They have free shuttle rides to connect you with the zoo, find out the timings from the counter",06-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:43:02.026453

The variety of birds is amazing. The best way to visit the park is on foot as the tram simply takes you to the aviaries, bypassing all the remaining exhibits.
Apart from the bird exhibits, our favorite was Lorry Loft Aviary Penguin Coast. Lorry loft aviary is a covered jungle giving birds a natural environment to live and breed. The most fascinating part was feeding the parakeets by hand.
Waterfall aviary was equally good experience.
Penguin Coast gives an opportunity for a close encounter with the Emperor Penguins.
Flamingos were beautiful. Birds of prey exhibits were very good.
The bird show was the best part.Just checkout the show timings from the park's website.
Being vegetarian , we got veg biryani in Hawk Cafe. It cost you SGD 8, but is was really good.
The best way to reach Jurong Bird Park is by MRT. Get down at Boon Lay MRT station and take a bus from there. The bus interchange is exactly adjacent to the MRT Station so it is going to be very convenient. From there it's just a 10-15 minutes bus ride to the park.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:43:07.920772

There are different feeding and you can purchase food to feed like flamingo. Then there's pelican chat.
Shows are in two places: hawks arena and pools amphitheatre (the vulture eagles show).

Watched them waddle clumsily and cutely across land and glide gracefully inside the water and also a couple that seemed to be a deep conversation (a tad tending towards acrimony I felt, with one of them gesturing pretty wildly with its flippers to the other one who was equally vocal in its response). They typically slide down a slope and land on their cute bellies which is called “tobogganing"".
Followed this with a penguin feeding session where we could experience feeding them small fish. Went on to some colourful macaws and a group of flamingoes (more orange than pink). Visited the bird breeder where they kept exhibits from the time an egg is hatched to the bird weaning, preparing food for the birds, the bird feeders, incubators and finally releasing them into the park. This was followed by the show ""the king of the skies"" where birds like eagles, hawks, owls and vultures were made to fly around an arena covered with spectators. The birds of paradise show featured exotic birds like macaws, toucans, pelicans, talking multi-lingual amazon parrot 'Amigo' who even sang Happy Birthday in English and some malay song and the cockatoo. Walked through some enclosures that housed the king fisher, the crowned pigeon, peacocks and peahens, starling, pelicans, spoonbills, hornbills etc. Took the tram to cover the remaining zones covering the lory loft (several small lorries that were being fed through small nectar bowls with people walking across suspension bridges with many birds flying close to us), the flightless birds - ostrich, the emu, cassowary and the graceful swans gliding over the water and then a walk through the waterfall aviary that housed the largest man made waterfall in a bird sanctuary.",11-2015,Family,2020-01-29 17:43:26.219011

We opted for walking the route of the park (don't waste money on the 'train') which is about 1.5 km and took us about 4 hours after we went in to all the enclosures etc. Some of the cages are on the old side but the staff are very caring and the animals don't seem distressed at all. A lot of signage about the illegal wildlife trade so it was good seeing the park trying to do its best to educate the public. The 'Lorry Loft' was our absolute favourite...coming from Australia we are a bit partial to the lorikeets and these guys were great !!

The varities of birds on display and the shows were more realisitc. Even the photos that we take with the birds at the entrance are not appealing.Earlier we were permitted to hold real big colourful birds on our hands and take photos. Now it is like small love birds are made to sit on a holding stand and we have to take photos with them. There are not much takers for this now. Another important aspect noticed was the toilets maintanence. They were not upto the Singapore standards. Very untidy, No tissues in some rooms. And no food available for vegetarians.

I understand now why many reviewers suggest that if time is limited, see the Zoo and skip the Bird Park. We did enjoy the Bird Park very much, but it is less extensive than the Zoo. If I was traveling with children and could choose only one site, the Zoo would win.

Having said that, the Bird Park was impressive. We enjoyed The High Flyers show very much. The Bird Park might also be an alternative to the Zoo if time is short. It could easily be thoroughly visited in 4 hours, the zoo takes longer.

It was a truly unique experience to see so many bird species in an open environment, all in one place. Especially enjoyed the interactive nature of most shows and attractions within the park. This is a must see, especially if you have young children in your party. Some tips that might prove helpful :

- The park is quite big so plan a 2-3 hour visit (Will suggest starting in the morning right when the park opens)
- Do not miss the shows - They take place at various locations around the park at specific times so allow yourself enough time to walk/take the tram and get good seats
- Check the weather - Shows may get cancelled if there are heavy showers so check the forecast before you plan your visit (Tickets are expensive so you will want to see as much as possible in one visit)
- Be mindful of the interactive nature of the park. The birds can get quite close to you and may even perch on you in some attractions (Aviary) so be cautious especially if you are bringing along a toddler or baby
- If you have kids in your party, you may want to keep some extra time at hand to splash around the water park before leaving",02-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:44:30.118540

Bus 251 was withdrawn and now it does not reach this park.

The park has 600 species of birds including hornbills, owls, penguins, pelicans, flamingoes, macaws and lories. The entrance fee is $28 for adults and $18 for children below the age of 12. For seniors above 60 years, the fee is $12. The park opens from 8.30 am to 6.00 pm. There are train rides available and if you are hungry or thirsty there are cafes and restaurants galore.

The penguins are housed in an air con enclosure and they have a pool to swim and exercise. The nocturnal birds are housed in another enclosure where only dim lights are provided. There are also bird shows where the trainers command the falcons to obey them when they are signalled to do so. The bird show is an attraction for all visitors.

Like everything in Singapore, there are lush green gardens here. Take note at the entrance as to what interactive displays they have with the birds and at what times. You can also pay to take a small train around the birdpark if you wish, but really you won't get to see much that way. There are birds in the usual large cages and then large ponds with large flocks of flamingoes, or pelicans that are stunning.

There are icecream stands inside if you're feeling hot. There is a restaurant inside, but it looked expensive, best to eat at the two places at the entrance. Look at both food shops before you decide though, one has very western burger style meals at around $15 and the other attached to the gift shop has lovely set meal options at around $6, which is where we had a sit down meal.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-29 17:45:17.098311

There were shows like lunch with parrots and a bird show too. Bird show was good. We didnot try lunch with parrots as we arrived late.

There was a separate section for penguins . Penguins were kept in an artificial ice cove. A man went and fed penguins morning and evening .

There was a man-made water fall which was highlight of the park. It was very pretty. On our way back from waterfall, we fed some birds with worms which they charged .

It was a must see on this trip back to Singapore and wasnt disappointed. They have added quite a bit since I was here last time and really improved other attractions. Took us about 3 hours to tour the park. I was especially excited for the rare macaws that are on display ....the Spix;s for example are extinct in the wild and only 150 in captiviity, so it was a real treat to get to see them in person. I love feeding the lories and lorikeets in their massive aviary but it did seem like there were much fewer in number than last time I was here. Most people seemed to have a hard time getting enough birds to drink all the nectar they provide. Most everyone just set the little cups down because there arent enough birds interested in coming around to drink the nectar. Anyway, its worth the trip out to Jurong. TAkes about 45mins from downtown. We took the green line all the way to Boon Lay station from City Hall. Didn’t have to change lines that way. Then you transfer to the 194 bus for about 10 mins and it drops you off in front of the park. Cost us S$1.60 each for the bus, you need exact change and just pay on the bus.

I pre booked my ticket online and planned out my 5 days in Singapore from Australia, scheduling the bird park for the first day. 3 days later we ran around the aquarium as fast as we could just to make a second trip to Jurong again.

I am a zoo keeper and love visiting zoos in different countries. I had always heard great things about Jurong from fellow bird lovers, keepers and breeders. I was not dissatisfied at all!

We decided to do the Birds Eye Tour where we got to meet a beautiful hornbill names Sally (shout out to her keeper Maddy!). We also got to fly a bird of prey on the glove. Our tour guide Grace was amazing. Such a beautiful person who couldn’t love her job anymore and was just happy to show people around in hopes her enthusiasm for the birds would rub off.

After the tour, we met up with Peter the hornbill keeper who took a good hour out of his extremely busy day to educate us on his birds. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about hornbills, to them being one of my favorite birds. Thank you so much Peter for your hospitality! This guy needs a pay rise, such a legend.

I’d also like to mention Mark in the breeding centre. He introduced us to a baby spoonbill which we got to feed, and we joked about how much of a pain eclectus parrots are to handraise. He had a smile on his face the whole time.

In Australia, zoo keepers always seem to want to “one up” each other in their facilities and keep training tips to themselves because they don’t want another zoo to be ‘better’ than them, but Jurong was nothing like that. Grace mentioned that if any of my keeping friends wanted help knowing how to breed certain birds, Jurong would love to give them some tips. That’s what the bird world is all about. Helping each other out.

So not only was the staff AMAZING but the actual exhibits were next level. The lory loft was my personal favorite as I am obsessed with lorikeets and own and handraised a few of my own. The waterfall exhibit with the African greys also gets a special mention.

So thanks Jurong for being the best bird park around and now my all time favorite zoo.",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 17:47:51.478897

Instead they shuffle you inside to a buffet restaurant & then tell you that you can take a drink or dessert out to the terrace where they do a small bird show. Really not worth the money to do. The advertising picture shows a lovely white table cloth with food & parrots right next to the visitors. It’s nothing like this at all.

Some of the areas of the park are great, mainly the huge netted walk through areas. Others are are very boring with many cages and dark shaded & overgrown areas. You will only interact with birds in the area where they have the lorikeets or in the main bird show.

I visited Kaunda Birdworld in Australia and was sort of expecting something better but was disappointed. There are however an enormous amount of birds but I don’t like looking at them in the smaller cages.

Also in one of their displays they have a picture of a wallaby & joey but have labelled it as a kangaroo which is incorrect.

You can also ride the 'Panorail' (in air-conditioned comfort) for a panoramic look at the bird park.
Set on 50 acres (20 hectares) of verdant green space, Jurong Bird Park is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. We can enjoy quality family-time at the various attractions, such as the ‘Birds & Buddies’ show, which runs twice a day and features characters in colourful costumes. We need to check the show schedule at the park when we arrive, as other shows too take place during the day.
We stopped by the African wetlands exhibit to see African birds in their habitat of ferns, palms and native-style pavilions and learnt about the environmental balance in which birds and humans both live. We also entered a misty jungle-style habitat at the Waterfall Aviary. We didn’t miss the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. We were able to feed fish to the penguins in the open arena on the opposite side.
We watched the show ""Birds of Prey"", featuring vultures, hawks, owls, etc., beautifully trained and handled by the Park attendants. The next show was called ""High Flyers"", featuring multi-coloured Parakeets and Macaws, performing flying feats, and showing amazing skill by flying through loops and obeying the commands of their trainers. One Macaw was able to recite songs in Chinese and call out numbers from one to ten in three languages!! It was a tremendous experience, to be specially enjoyed by young and old. The finale was a grand parade of Pelicans and Flamingos!
It is truly astounding that the trainers have shown patience and spent countless hours training these birds.

I wanted to get there for the bird shows, the first one started at 10am and the next was at 11am. The first one was Kings of the Skies which was teaching you about Hawks and Vultures - excellent show! The second was probably more amusing which was High Flyers. We also went through the Lorry Lorikeet section where the birds were very friendly and would crawl onto your hands and shoulders. I was actually surprised at how big the complex was and there was certainly lots to see. It is a fair walk to get around all the park so suggest you buy a ticket for the train. Singapore does these attractions so well! Recommend a visit if you have an interest in birds but definitely make it for the shows.

If you can, it's worth catching the shows. Token feeding (for S$2) of the African Penguins near the entrance was a highlight. We spend about 4 hours at the park.

I bought the 4-in-1 park hopper ticket. I paired Jurong bird park with River Safari, followed by Rainforest Lumina (a separate ticket, not covered in the 4-in-1 ticket) in the one day. Looking back, I think it was a good decision.

To get between Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo, there is a shuttle for S$6pp, but the person at the stand (at front of the bird park) told us it only operates on the hour. We just missed one, so we were going to line up for the taxi, wanting to not waste time.

When we were there, the weather was bad, it rained heavily after we arrived when we were waiting for one of the bird shows, I think it was king of the skies or something to do with prey/eagles.

It rained heavily and we were not able to watch the show at all, but that is understandable. What's not acceptable is that everyone that was there for the show had to squeeze behind the small shelter behind the viewer seatings, waiting for the rain to end or to be less heavy so that we can make it to other shows.

The bird park should have some contingency for these scenarios so that visitors can still move back to the main entrance hall in the event umbrellas are not available instead of being stranded at one location.

My suggestion may not be suitable as the park is meant to be",06-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 17:48:37.793588

There are the usual standard birds there, but also ones you are unlikely to see elsewhere. The bird shows are not too tacky.

To get the full experience, I would recommend spending about 5 hours there, and get there as early as possible. Travel to Boon Lay MRT and then take the no 194 bus to the park.

There are water dispensers all over the park, so you only need to take an empty bottle. Food is available inside the park and outside the entrance, both local and fast food. Expect to pay more than you would in the city, but not too excessive.

Another fun bird to watch was the Common Crowned Pigeon who didn’t mind us being within a foot of it to take pictures. We could have stayed all day. Make sure to put on bug spray before you go!

Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27). From the Boon Lay bus interchange, take Bus No. 194, which will take you straight to Jurong Bird Park.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 17:49:41.648647

Therefore the ratio of birds to humans are lesser.. with the purchasing of food to feed the birds with the large number of tourists, makes the birds feel overly full.. you hardly have the chance to feed it for more than 10 secs before it gets bored and flew away.. so get your cameras ready!

A drive of approx 15 mins and we arrive at the entrance to the Bird Park. First sight is a display with many species of parrots and the opportunity to have a photo taken. Grab a Park map and hop on the tram for a leisurely trip to station 1. Leave the tram and wander through the displays then pick up the tram again to the next station.
Outstanding displays although some appeared empty but actually birds were nesting so not visible.
We did not do the Australian section, we know our birds but rest of Park is very good, you have the opportunity to get close and personnel with the parrots and feed them, have your photo taken with them.

My recommendation would be not to take one of the tours that offer to pick you up from the hotel. Typically they don’t give you enough time at the park, and they put you there when it is at the most crowded. Take your time. There is much to see. I also would not recommend the tram ride since you really just ride by the many attractions and don’t see anything. Simply follow the tram ride path. Many attractions that don’t seem much from the outside, but inside they are huge and captivating. You just don’t see it by riding by.

Once there, they offer you packages and we took the zoo and bird park ticket which was good, but since we arrived at 10.30am, we could see the park only on that day and had to see the zoo on another day. Having said that, you need to spend the whole day at the bird park if you truly want to make the most of It, or else have to wake up really early and be there as soon as the park opens.
Once you enter the place, the pelicans, parrots, peacocks and especially the eagles and vultures are truly beautiful. Every enclosure provides us with ample information about each species, which is what I especially liked.

The two bird shows cannot be missed. All in all it was a wonderful experience.",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 17:50:26.702831

The highlight though was the bird show where they have various different types of birds 'performing' in the arena where they show off their hunting skills, tricks and natural habits. The birds are incredibly intelligent and the trainers are really expert at handling them.

Jurong Bird Park is well thought through and offers many ways for visitors to be engaged.

And the shows, which offer some interactive elements, are superb!

We love the pelicans! Watching them during feeding time is a hoot! Storks that are not from the same exhibit will come and steal the food! The bird keepers feed them nonetheless to prevent the storks from attack the pelican eggs.

Established in 1971 this is the worlds largest bird park containing various bird species from all corners of the world. As a bird fancier I couldn't miss it. Had a great time but underestimated the size of the park and the time it would take to go through it. Here are a few tips for those planning a visit here.

1. Getting here - The Jurong Bird Park is located in the Suburb of Jurong, which is located in the west of Singapore - far away from the tourist epicentre. We went via the MRT. You get on the green east-west line to 'Boon Lay'. This will eject you in a large shopping centre. Walk through this to the bus terminal and get on bus number 194. This runs in a loop and from the station it will be your first stop. Do the same backwards (if you miss catching the bus at the stop you were dropped off at you can walk under the highway to the opposite side of the road). Unfortunately getting here via the MRT takes quite some time - we spent around 1.5 hours each way from our hotel room on orchard road before we got into the park.

2. Cost - To purchase a ticket for Jurong it is 29 (adult), 19 (child) and 13 for a senior citizen. For what you get this is good value

3. Food - There is two restaurants at the entrance to the park but both are quite overpriced as you would expect.

4. Weather dependent - The bird park is almost exclusively located outside which can be a problem with singapores often passing rainshowers.

5. Shows - There are a few shows but one that i would absolutely recommend is the 'King of the Skies' show which displays birds of prey such as vultures, flacons, eagles and hawks.

6. Time - This is where I really got it wrong. You really want around 4-5 hours in the park to cover everything. You will be surprised just how much stuff there is to do. When combined with significant travel times on the MRT you want to dedicate a whole day of your holiday to this bird park rather than thinking you can fit it into a half day slot.

Overall I had a really good time here and I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it to others.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 17:51:10.333406

We had been 6 times to Singapore before but never thought about going here as thought it would be ""ordinary"". Fantastic exhibits and the Bird Show at 3pm not to be missed.

Can't say too much here as will give it all away.

,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Ducktalk,482508308,08-05-2017,4,Wonderful flying critters,"Took a train to Boon Lay station (has a shopping centre there so you can stop and get snacks/lunch etc) then caught the local 194 bus to Jurong Bird Park - takes 10 mins and costs S$3.20 return. Cheap as chips.

Get there as early as possible - it gets real hot in Singapore and the crowds at the bird park build up as time goes on. When you've had enough and want to come back, just wait at that same bus stop as the bus does a little u-turn and takes you back to the station. Simple!

Entry to the Park is rather pricey at S$29 each, but one doesn't mind if the birds are loved and looked after. Personally I found some of the cages rather small for the larger birds but they all seemed very well cared for.

One of the major frustrations for me was the width of the wire on the cages. Most were too close together to get decent photos of the birds (I draw and paint them later so decent photos are important).

There's a very staged bird show which those who aren't around birds much may enjoy. I didn't mind it but my partner wasn't too thrilled.

Best part was coming across a pond where a staff member was feeding night herons and a rather shy jabiru. They could all fly off if they chose so I had uninhibited access to photograph the birdlife in its natural environment. Happiness plus.

Loved the lizards, squirrels, hornbills - well, pretty much everything really. Staff all seemed very pleasant although we didn't have a lot to do with them.

HINT - Wouldn't go on a weekend if you can help it - the crowds would be truly nasty.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 17:51:11.413443

A number of depressing rather small enclosures made a bad start to our day. However things improved when we reached the Birds of Paradise display, always a pleasure to see them.
After a light lunch at the Lori aviary, we entered that, wanting to feed them, which we’ve done several times. We wanted to walk round first. To our surprise we found the loris gorging from an abandoned tub. As we approached they all flew off. I held the tub as I have in the past, and none would come near me! A staff member suggested I held it near a branch at arms length, this worked in a fashion, 2 loris did come.
We watched somebody else try to feed them, without success. Further from the entrance, I tried again, and this time 2 birds did come to us. The photographers came, and encouraged birds who liked them to come to us. We noted that the birds were more confident while the photographers were present.
Clearly visitors have upset the loris, who are now scared of getting close to them (read my previous review for a totally different experience). If you try to feed them, please don’t try to touch them, and stay very still, and wait for them to come to you; perhaps we can restore the pleasure they used to get from playing with visitors.
A further walk brought us to the Waterfall Aviary. Fantastic range of birds, some coming close and some in the distance; this is similar to seeing them in the wild.
And that ended our day, and we’d only had time to see and admire half the exhibits! And we didn't even see the shows, which we have enjoyed in the past.
Finally the practical points. Plenty of clean toilets. We had mango lassi from the curry shop (forget its exact name) before entering, it was excellent. Lunch at the Lori Aviary café was tasty, from a limited menu.
Walking for those with disabilities is good, with smooth pavements. Seats were available in places, but some areas lacked places to rest. Most seats are benches, making it more difficult to stand up. The tram might be difficult to enter for the disabled, it’s quite high off the ground, and lacks good handholds.
Overall, a very enjoyable day. Well worth a visit, however if I had to choose, I’d prefer a day at the zoo; slightly better conditions for the animals, and an even more amazing experience.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 17:51:21.261684

It was very easy to do so and gave us a great look at the south western part of Singapore. It took us approximately 40 mins to travel to Jurong after leaving the City Hall train station. Upon arrival the main show was beginning (11 am) and it was a must to see. The show went for about 30 mins and was very professionally run and an absolute delight to watch. As we both love birds we wanted to interact as much as possible with the birds. Every area in the park was clean and well deigned. Some of the birds were able to fly freely and others caged in large enclosures. We also used the motorised train to get about the park. We even fed the many parrots in their enclosure. When we decided to leave and return we simply walked back to the bus stop and caught the bus back to the train station and then back to City Hall. I must admit we had a relaxing few hours here and would highly recommend this attraction to everyone.

The lorikeet loft walk is lovely when the birds come and eat the nectar from the purchasable cup.

We saw the birds in flight show and it was corny as expected but amusing. Amazing just to see the Hyacinth macaws in flight.

It has many sections and areas that depends on the natural habitat of each one. Though some areas are small and old, like the Penguin Coast and the birds of prey cages, I believe that the experts know very well how these should be addressed. My review is based on my observations and enjoyment inside the facility.

My beau and I spent an entire day in the bird park, the most enjoyable moment would be feeding the Lory birds in Lory Loft. The nectar is S$3. I also fed the penguins, with fish. The fish plate can ve acquired by donating S$2 to the Penguin Coast. I enjoyed sight seeing birds and enjoying how marvelous they flap their wings or clean their feathers, the trail can be by foot or by unlimited tram ride for S$5. I also suggest going for the bird shows. Make sure you read the schedules.

The washrooms are clean, sinks and wash areas are available at every area, there are food places outside the park--the staff will allow reentry, they will stamp you. The food served in Bongo Burgers are great and are somehow worth the pricing tho it has theme park price.

For kids, I suggest to let them stay with a guardian at the Birds of Play area. This is a playground. I suggest this better than bringing them to see the birds. Birds are sensitive and do not respond well to noise and rash behavior, toddlers will also not benefit in seeing them. The park is most welcoming to ages 10 and above.

My ratings are as follows:
Scope and variety - 5
Bird areas - 4
Cleanliness of facilities - 4.5
Availability of water, washrooms, food stalls - 5
Photography worthiness - 5
Bird interactions - 5
Bird shows - 5

Ps. Check the temperature and weather in Singapore before you plan your visit. Wear light clothing.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:53:17.014723

Easy to get to on the MRT to Boon Lay station then bus 194. $29 for admission + $5 for the train ride, you can get discounts on-line and from a few travel agents (we got about 10% off buying tickets at the Chinatown Visitor Centre).

Plenty of birds here, mostly Asian, but also from Africa and the Americas. Many tourists don't get to see everything as they just get on the train, but it does not stop at the owl house, or the house with the huge pigeons. We walked around the loop first, took about 4 hours, and then caught the train for a short ride around again. If walking be aware that there are some steep up and down sections. But worth it to see the birds.

Stop at the Lory Loft and hand feed lorikeets, great fun, very interactive. We had lunch at the waterfall cafe in the waterfall aviary. The food was basic - hotdogs or snack food, although there were some nice looking fresh salads. Prices were ok. The shows appeared to be popular - free flight etc. There's a souvenir ship at the exit, plenty there but we were really surprised that they didn't have any books about Singapore birds, they're missing an opportunity.",08-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:53:17.369514

Even though the way to the JBP is a bit out of the way, with the MRT and the bus system it's quite cool. A cab driver told me that the JBP is moving closer to the night safari area so it'll be more convenient. If you have kids, they'll love this place but we didn't enjoy it as much as the other animal stuff because we just don't like to see caged animals. One can club other river safari with this as well and spend the whole day with birds and animals. If it's a hot day, I'd recommend the tram or head out wearing caps and with water to avoid dehydration and fatigue.

,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Lizzy T,370589205,06-05-2016,5,Definitely worth a visit but bring a mosquito repellent!,"It is a great place to visit for adults and kids. But make sure to bring anti mosquito spray. ( I haven’t had problems with mosquitoes anywhere else I have visited in Singapore apart from Jurong Bird Park, literally got bitten more then 20 times in a space of 15 minutes). If you forgotten one, there is some available to purchase from the gift shops around the park.

The park itself is very pretty, its big enough, and well kept. There were a lot of birds on display that I have never seen before, which was a treat. Be Ready to spend 3-4 hours in the park, to see it all!

I loved the bird show. Visitors can participate in the show, by holding different objects for the birds to fly through or to land on them. ( I got chosen for one of the parts, it was quick but fun! ) If you would like to participate, make sure to sit in the middle aisle (section). There is also a place where you can feed the parrots ( Lorry Loft), which is fantastic experience & great photo opportunity. Feeding the birds at The Loft was definitely my favourite memory of the park!

Ticket for the park is SGD$29, but if you book online there is 10% discount. You can also get ‘Park Hopper’ ticket , which allows you to pick from 4 different parks: Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari or Singapore Zoo. Again if you book online there is some sort of discount.
There is a tram that goes around the park, and the tickets are about $5. I personally felt that there was no need for it, even though I bought a ticket and took the tram, I felt like the stops were not well positioned, and that I kept missing parts of the park, so I end up just walking around , which was more enjoyable for me.

To get to the park you will need to get MRT & the bus, and it is quite a long journey. We stayed at Bugis station, and it took us I think just over an hour each way. We got MRT green line to Boon Lay, ones of the MRT, there is a bus Station within the Boon Lay Shopping centre. You can buy tickets for the bus on the bus ( will need exact change) or at the machine. I can’t remember which bus number I got, I just asked at the information point.",04-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:53:55.950934
,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Emerald V,370340532,05-05-2016,5,absolutely wonderful!,"my husband and i are still in awe at how well-maintained the park is. All animals look so healthy, the color of their feathers are magnificent. Each section smells clean and there was enough room for the birds to fly around.

the shows were fantastic. High flyers show was very entertaining but i enjoyed the King of the skies show more. The size of the eagles and vultures they have were glorious. the close relationship of caretakers with the birds was apparent which shows how happy the birds are though they are in captivity. the zoo is equipped with research,breeding and feeding labs.

take the tram ride ($5) to go around the park with ease but make sure to go down at every station and walk around so that you can see the birds up close. There are several benches near the birds' habitats so that you can just enjoy observing them.

bring an umbrella and a bottle of water cause it can get really hot when walking around especially around noon to three in the afternoon.

do consider going early so as to see all the birds and you can spend more time learning about them.

i'd say this is definitely one of the best places to visit for bird lovers. :)",05-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:53:56.282645

It is very easy to spot the Bird Park and know when to get off the bus because nearly everyone will be alighting there.

We saw both shows, the High Flyers and the Kings of the Skies. We thought that the presentation was excellent and it was mindboggling to think of how many hours must have gone into training the birds to achieve such feats.

After the shows we visited the penguins at feeding time and for $2.00 I was able to purchase some small fish to throw to them.

We found the tram very useful for getting around as the terrain is quite hilly and the weather was very hot and humid. The frequency of the tram was very good.

After the shows we attended Lunch with the Parrots ($25.00 p.p.) which I booked online prior to our visit to Singapore. This, unfortunately, was a disappointment. It was very poorly organised and the service and quality of the food was mediocre.

We arrived at the restaurant exactly on time, and the sign at the entrance said ""Wait to Be Seated"", however after quite some time waiting, no-one showed any interest in us so we made our way through all the tables of people already eating from the buffet. When we asked at the counter what should we do, the waiter nonchalantly replied ""sit at any of the tables with a 'Reserved' sign on them"". The waiters in general didn't seem to be doing anything other than standing around or wandering around aimlessly. No-one appeared to be giving any direction and my daughter saw two waiters flicking something at each other and laughing.

The food selection was very limited and poor in quality. There was no water and the only other drink apart from tea and coffee was orange cordial. I was somewhat heartened when I found out there was ice cream, however someone had left the lid open and it was melted.

The bird show was entertaining and the presenters were personable and did a good job.

There is plenty to see and do, the attraction is reasonably priced, however you should think about what you want to see and visit when in Singapore as there are big discounts on multi park ticket purchases. If you are planning a Zoo visit or wildlife safari then buying a four park pass might be the way to go as the individual ticket prices are significantly cheaper when buying a multi park pass.

1) Time 5-6 h for whole Park including shows.

2) Got ticket from airport, discounted. Online site have offers too.

3) Too much walking...wear sports shoes

4) Get your own food/water..save money. Food n drinks are available here but are lil expensive.

5) Shows are must. Parrot show and Eagle show. Both 2 times a day. Morning and evening. Without shows, its just not worth it.
Very entertaining.

- Get your seats lil early before the show. Front seat will give good view and at the end of the show u can get first in line to get a personal photo with the birds. Middle seats might get u to be volunteer for holding birds, ring for them to pass by. Its fun if u r selected. For eagle show, Sit middle of the amphitheater , 2nd - 3rd row are good n most likely to be chosen as volunteer.

6) At end (closing time : 6 PM), they were nice enough to provide bus to the nearest MRT (Metro/Rail).

Check pics.

We would have liked more time, so we could have walked around the park. Next time we go to Singapore we will go on our own and spend most of the day there.

To be honest, these birds are not overly shy, and it's possible to get close to them even without holding a cup of nectar, but it's quite something when they actually hop onto your hand. One bird near the entrance to the aviary was quite keen on pecking at our heels too!

The staff will take photos of you with the lorikeets but be aware that these are $20 each to buy; photos with the macaws and cockatoos at the entrance to the bird park are $25 each.

We also enjoyed watching one of the hornbills being shown off and fed what I think must have been mealworms.

Another place to get very close to all sorts of birds is the Waterfall Aviary, where you can not only rest and have a snack - they sell pots of fruit which are very refreshing on a hot day - but take photos of superb starlings and the spectacular crowned pigeon (which doesn't much resemble the pigeons we know back in the UK but is much more glamorous).

We also saw the cassowaries with their bizarre and fantastic casques, and even spotted some green iguanas making their way around the grounds.

Definitely a day well spent and easily accessed from the MRT system and then by the connecting 194 bus which drops you right outside.

Entrance is $28 but it's a pity that the reduced entry fee of $12 for senior citizens only applies to Singaporeans, so that us oldies from other parts of the world who have made the journey have to pay full price ...",01-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:54:41.625881

I often go bird watching and love birds so have mixed feelings about caged birds - but it is clear the Jurong Bird Park staff take excellent care of the birds and are involved heavily in conservation work. The birds have plenty of room except the hornbills. I have seen hornbills in the wild many times and they need about 10 times the space they have at the Park as a minimum.

We thought the quiet dark area where the astonishing owls are should be patrolled by the staff as people were very noisy despite the signs telling them to keep quiet!

Other than that the variety of birds and the beautiful lay out of the Park make this a really wonderful day out. It's fabulous.

Go early to catch the shows. The website has details of all the current shows.

Practicalities (1) You need comfy flat shoes (2) The best way to get there is by MRT to Boon Lay and then the 194 bus. To get back just go to the 194 bus stop where you got off, the bus carries on for about 5 minutes and then goes round a roundabout and down the other side of the road. This is easier than crossing the very wide busy road via the underpass. (3) Spray with citronella or some other ""bird friendly"" anti mosquito stuff if you are prone to getting bitten (4) Book in advance as we queued for quite a while on a Thursday morning (5) There are lots of places to shelter if it rains.

You will love this place. Highly recommended.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 17:55:15.806436

I have to say, all the birds look healthy and content. Do have on and take some anti bite stuff though.
The one thing that does get to me.. Why do people spend their time ' selfie' ing themselves, standing in the way of everyone else and expect us to give them space for self posing? They would have been much better enjoying the birds instead of themselves!

At the bird park we noted that once again Singapore has introduce multiple pricing for locals and tourists - for tourists the entrance fee was $SG 33 (no discount).
Several areas of the park we closed for renovations.

There is a tram service around the park which stops at three stations - Main Stn, Lorry Loft - well worth a visit to feed the lorikeets and Waterfall stn to visit the indoor waterfall .

The park has a huge array of bird life - but on this visit we noted that the park has a run down appearance - needs a coat of paint in may places and many of the aviaries require updating - in fact some of the birds appeared distressed especially in the parrot exhibits

Many of the birds are hard to see as the cages are old, with old thick wire restricting view - no chance of clear photographs as the cage dominates. We appreciate securing the birds in space that does not stress them is essential, but we have been to many bird parks where the cages are much more viewer friendly. A number of displays were closed for improvement work (which is hopefully good news, given our previous comment). We watched one of the twice daily bird shows which was limited and disappointing, having been spoiled by the high quality of a similar style show at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The talking parrot was amusing and the flamingos walking on stage at the end were the highlights. The walk through areas had few bird species that are rare or excite.

The Lory Loft was our favorite exhibit where one could walk with a cup of nectar for lories to feed from, right on your hand. Just beware of their droppings.
The staff made up for the worn down architecture and finishings of the location.

Get there early, definitely by taxi (approx $25 rush hour time from Clarke Quay way) and enjoy having the park to yourself for a while. The highlights were by far the shoebills and the wide variety of hornbills. They do need bigger enclosures as do the birds of prey. The walk in aviaries were an wonderful experience, especially birds of asia and the waterfall aviary - these do seem the right size for the birds they have flying around. The penguins however looked very desolate and is much need of an expansion and upkeep.

I went to the high flyers show, I really didn't like the ending which I know should be the highlight but there had so many birds on stage thought it probably was a stressful experience for birds involved. Keepers however handled them well and were enthusiastic in explaining about protecting birds' environments.

I spent abut 4 hours here as I loved viewing each type of bird, you never get this opportunity to see the size of some of them or hear what they sound like flying around and talking. However I couldn't help thinking that the quality of life for some of the birds particularly was really poor given their enclosure size. They probably could do with more information signs to go with their endangered level and how the park is supporting their conservation and expanding some of the enclosure sizes.The same could probably be said of alot of zoos and likely comes with the nature of attraction trying to balance out quality vs public being able to see them",02-2019,Solo,2020-01-29 17:56:21.110647

To get there I took the MRT on the green East-West line and got off at Boon Lay MRT station. The public bus number 194 goes from Boon Lay MRT to the front gate of the Jurong Bird Park in about 7 minutes. You can do the same on the return trip but have to walk across the road in the pedestrian tunnel to catch the 194 bus on the other side of the road to return to Boon Lay MRT station.

Being so far out of town the park wasn't crowded compared to other Singaporean attractions and I bought my entry ticket at the gate without queuing. You have the option to pay $5 for unlimited use of the tram inside the bird park, I definitely recommend this even for a keen walker, as the tram does loops of the park which makes it easy to move around and see which sites worth visiting.

This bird park have some unique birds I haven't anywhere else and the park have plenty of lush green gardens with flowering plants and scenic lakes. The main highlight is the 11am show at the Pools Amphitheatre, but the penguin feeding and the 30 metre tall waterfall were also very impressive.

You can buy food and drink from several outlets inside the park which even has a Pizza Hut, and well maintained restrooms are scattered throughout. My visit to this bird park took me 6 hours from the time I left the hotel until my return, so if planning to visit the park you should budget at least half a day for a proper visit.",12-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 17:56:29.313815

It is quite a long way to wall to see all of the exhibits. I don't know what I expected, but most of the birds were in cages which is a disappointment and somewhat sad to see such beautiful creatures locked away like that. Some of the Parrots at Parrot Paradise looked as if they were stressed, showing repetitive behavior that caged animals so often do after prolonged captivity. I actually found it upsetting. The Waterfall Aviary was however good, with free flying birds in a big enclosure and the birdsong was a wonderful experience (not that you could actually see the singing birds all of the time). In all it is a place that can thrill and disappoint at the same time. If you want to see free birds in Singapore, go to Changi Village and Park - its free and I have seen Sea Eagles swoop down and take fish, Herons, Hornbills, Parrots and many more species just by sitting at the water front.",12-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 17:56:29.662482

The caged parrots in the parrots section looked very sad. A few of them stuck to the cage sides. Couple of birds tried to reach the visitors as if trying to get out either that or feeling bored.
Being caged is not natural and parrots are highly fun-loving social creathres.And they need much fly time out in the sky freely.
While the female staff minded how the parrot tried to interact with the visitor. Please don't forget to care for the well being of the birds that are caged first, protecting them from physical interaction from visitors second.
If you want visitors to stay away from the birds. Please place them in the waterfall section don't caged them to see. Place them in waterfall section to roam freely that is the second best option.
In that way they have a choice not to interact with visitors. Remember staff are not a bird prison guard.Get your priority right from the start.",12-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 17:56:36.651360

Jurong Bird Park is Asia’s largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species, including some endangered species like the birds of paradise, macaws, birds of prey, etc.
This bird park offers so much fun and education towards its visitors about the life of bird. There are some exhibits and two that I like most are the ""Penguin Coast"" and the ""World of Darkness"". In Penguin Coast you will see how several penguin species are put together in a coastal-area-like exhibit. They can swim and hop on rocky surfaces, while sometimes they will just lay down and cooling themselves lazily on the ice made by the ice machine. You must come to their feeding time to see them swimming to catch fish from their keepers.
The World of Darkness exhibit is home to several owl species. Since most owl species are nocturnal, the ambience is controlled in such a way that inside the owl exhibit, the day time is turned into night time. Thus, you will see the owls actively flying and preening their feathers, also hunting for food. However, the last time I visit the park, they already closed down the owl exhibit.
The highlight of the bird park in my opinion, is the bird show. You must not miss the two bird shows, the ""High Flyers"" and the ""King of the Skies"". The High Flyers show will let you see some bird species demonstrate their ability, like the talking parrots. While the King of the Skies show will let you mesmerized by the keen senses of birds of prey when they are hunting for food in the wild. You should also see the feeding frenzy of the pelican, the keepers will introduce you to the 9 pelican species in the bird park while feeding them their favorite fish. It is a trully nice experience to have since some of the pelicans will fly above your head with their massive wingspan, circling around the pond, yet they are not flying away.
Jurong Bird Park, in my opinion, is a must visit place when you go to Singapore. It is one good place for adult and children alike to learn a lot about the life of bird and the conservation efforts done by the Wildlife Reserve Singapore to save them from extinction.

Wild birds (eg stork-billed kingfisher) also came to the park to add to the excellent displays.

The shows were OK - a little bit “touristy” for me (but go to the Hawk Conservancy at Andover UK for really great displays where the birds perform as nature intended).

We walked round the whole park, took around 5 hours, and avoided the over-priced restaurants.

I had not planned to see the bird park but since I bought the pass which included it - I planned a short visit. To my incredible surprise, it was my favourite of the parks! Incredible birds in a beautiful setting, the pinnacle being the waterfall enclosure which surprised me at how such a large area was still enclosed for the birds safety, but it felt like it was entirely in the wild! My only complaint was the bars that get in the way of some picture taking, some of the birds were in large enclosures but thick bars are in the way of the viewer. The age of the park is most likely part of the issue, but having some plexiglass or a lighter style bar would be nice for viewers. Especially regarding the Hornbills (so many types!)
It was rainy when I started my day... rather it was a downpour. So an umbrella plus a rain poncho were needed. There are not many spots to sit out a rain... but the birds were staying still and some were bathing in the rain, so it was good viewing regardless of the weather!
The tram was a great way to get my bearings as to how the park is laid out... I rode the full route as it was pouring rain and I was killing time, turned out that it was a wonderful preview. Do not try to get pictures from the tram as it goes too fast, but pay attention to the sights it points out as these are great to get pictures of while you walk the route.
Do not forget to bring money as it is 100% worth the few dollars to feed the Lory’s at the Lori Loft. These bright colourful birds are a crowd favourite and will land on you to get the nectar from cups you hold. Both young children and adults get joy out of this experience!
The enclosures where you can walk through and see the birds run and fly about are fabulous. The sounds and sights were memorizing. The nursery was wonderfully set up so you can see the process from eggs hatching to babies.

The only exhibits worth seeing are the waterfall pavillion and the lorry loft because birds have somewhat of a natural environment to fly around and be free. The larger birds like hawks, hornbills, parrot exhibits almost made me cry. It was horrendous. Miserable birds in small pens. No toys or stimulation or anything to engage with. Such smart intelligent birds kept that way really put me off this place. Parrots and Macaws like to live in the treetops not so low down. Everywhere you looked there were birds hanging off the tops of cages as if to want to escape. The whole Disneyland train thing was a bit much even though it helped with the heat the prerecorded messages were smarmy. Too many loud noisy tourists allowed in the park at once. Can you go anywhere in Asia withour animals/birds being treated like a freakshow? They are razing their nature to the ground to build up their cities thus destroying the natural world so they can put their wildlife in cages. It's super depressing.

The shows were incredible though, especially the vultures in the birds of prey show. The staff are all very knowledgeable and they really push the conservation message which is great, even promoting bringing reusable water bottles and places to fill up on the way.

Cages are very small, some of the larger birds can hardly ever move around. Jurong Bird Prison would be a more suitable name for some of what you see. As for the visitor experience, the park is very commercialized. More often than not it feels like it's all about selling food, drinks, and other trinkets, while the birds are just a sideshow, and when you want to leave, you discover the only way out is to walk through a gift shop and a restaurant, as there is no other exit. Still, at least you as a visitor can eventually get out of this tourist trap, while the birds don't have this luxury. On the upside, all the staff were friendly, and the labels are interestingly written in good English.

There are tons of birds to see and two verry good shows with free flying birds of all sorts. There are also scheduled feedings and times where you can interact with some of the birds.

It’s Singapore and the park is almost completely outside so it can get hot, steam, and rainy. To help stay cool the park is shaded with trees and there are fans placed at strategic locations. If that doesn’t work there are also some exhibits /areas which are in air-conditioned zones. For example, the artic penguin viewing area is air conditioned and so is the breeding center.

If you take your time and try to see all the shows and feedings you can easily spend 5+ at the park.

Don’t miss the Lory Loft; a large aviary featuring Lories and Lorikeets. You can purchase a fairly large cup of nectar that the birds will come down and feed on; often during this feeding they will landing on your hands, arms shoulders, etc. It only costs $3 Singapore dollars which is a much better deal than the tiny amount I got at a similar attraction in the US for $5 USD.

You can supposedly get to the bird park via the mrt and a bus but coming from downtown that will take at least an hour. It is far easier to get a taxi which will cost $15-$20 USD and take about 25 minutes. There is a queue for taxis at the entrance but they do not come very regularly; it would be best to call up a cab or an Uber if you don’t want to wait forever.",11-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 17:57:22.711775

,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/WayneLLC,540412865,12-11-2017,5,Bird Paradise,"Experience :-

Where Colour Lives - is the tagline of the Jurong Bird Park which I also found to be the most fitting. The many colours (of Birds, it is as though someone higher up in the nature splash a can of paint over them) that you are about to come across will bound to induce visual excitements. Also, are you a self proclaimed bird specialist and think you know that many different species? You might have to re-think again.

It's a shame on me, as a Local that my last visit specifically to Jurong Bird Park was probably more than a good decade ago on a school excursion - my impression of here has always been a small, uninteresting park; but that totally changes today. I truly enjoyed the good mixture of open enclosures that allow one to get up-and-personal with the birds when they can afford it. I do understand the rationale of some species/hostile types that have to caged in though I hope that some of them can be converted to partially glass to allow better visual and observations.

As always, I really appreciate the prominent messages across the Parks that help to create an environmental awareness and Human's actions that can have an implication on the Animals. I have also heard the Bird Park will soon be shifting to Mandai area alongside with her siblings (the Zoo and Safari's) and I hope this move and the accessibility that follow, may allows more visitors to come visit in her new reborn Glory.

Tips/Advice:-

1) Preparations : Especially those with kiddos, Anti-Mozzie is highest priority. Some of the indoor enclosure were literally filled with mosquito (I counted 30+ bites on mine :() and the wet weather of late definitely did not help. Wear comfortably (shoes and clothes) and also study the weather precipitation beforehand.

2) Preferred Time of Visiting? Having visited on a Weekend, i think the crowd is manageable on Weekday as well as Weekend; if you have a choice, do visit early on a Weekday to have the park all to yourself

3) Admission Fee? Its $29 for adult, $19 for child and usually some discounts will apply when you buy via Online for Locals. One should definitely consider the multi-Parks special (check out the ParkHopper Special) to enjoy a decent discount

4) Location : it be best to take Bus, either transferring from the Zoo (which the Bus cost about $4-6) if you are Park Hopping or taking 194 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange (Boon Lay MRT on the Green line)

Suggestion for the Park's Management:

1) As part of the Park Hopper bundle and experience, maybe you can look into covering the costs of transports between Zoo/River-Night Safari to the Jurong Bird Park which as of now cost between $4-6. I do think the cost of transport is marginal as compared to driving the crowd flow to visit Jurong Bird Park too, which is currently awkwardly situated away from the 3 other parks. I believe the gesture of waiving the Transports cost to Jurong Bird Park will for 1) boost traffic heading to Bird Park due to the ease and cost of transferring and 2) encourage people to buy 4-parks Park Hopper bundle.

Tips:
1) Go EARLY (i.e. be there at 8.30 am) to view the birds in relative peace and quiet. It gets packed by afternoon
2) If you intend to feed the lories at Lory Loft, the park sells a small cup of nectar water ($3 each - prepare exact change) which will attract them. However, go in the MORNING as the birds will be too full by afternoon, and will ignore you
3) F&B is available but overpriced. You can stock up necessities at Jurong Point, the shopping centre next to Boon Lay MRT
4) Wear comfortable shoes as the park is on hilly terrain. Also bring mosquito repellent. Most of the park is in the open with no shade
5) The majority of the birds are caged up, and you won't be able to take clear photos. Manually focusing with a long telephoto lens will help blur cage lines",05-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 17:57:41.077937

Everything here is well taken care of. There is a tram, and I did ride it later into my visit. It makes 3 stops. I took it up to the aviary with the giant waterfall.

There are some signs to identify what you are seeing. It was great. Very relaxing. There also is a snack bar here. I then walked outside and wanted to see the parrots.

The park is a wonderful attraction with its lovely grounds, tropical vegetation, huge walk-in aviaries and more than 400 different bird species. It is possible to take a ""train"" around the park with a couple of stops where you can get off to look at birds more closely. I chose to walk despite the heat and humidity and it was well worth the effort as I saw all the aviaries and could spend lots of time in those of the most interest. I particularly enjoyed the penguin and owl displays and the flocks of scarlet ibis and roseate spoonbills in the wetlands were breathtaking. There were plaques with plenty of information (some in Braille for blind visitors) about the various species in each aviary, in many cases with details about the conservation status of each bird.
The adult entrance price is $29 but I decided to buy a year's pass for a mere $39 and have already visited twice. On the second visit I went to the bird feeding in the Waterfall Aviary. It was a little disappointing as the keeper didn't show a lot of interest and seemed reluctant to go into details about some of the birds when asked. I also went to the High Flyers Show in the Pools Amphitheatre. It was interesting, with the birds appearing at ease with their activities, and the commentary was informative although I would have liked more of a conservation message to be pushed instead of one single reference to buying recycled timber. I felt a little uncomfortable when a large group of
flamingoes were herded on to the stage at the end of the show as they looked stressed but otherwise the visit was a wonderful one and I look forward to going again in the future.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 17:57:44.278688

Here u can feed them using special food u can buy. Please don't feed them your sandwiches/bread/snacks! The pelicans are amazing and the feeding time pretty unique.

If you do not like zoos with areas like this, do not go. On balance I saw enough that I liked to recommend this place.

Starting from penguins to owls, one gets to see almost every kind of bird. In this regard, the management of Bird Park has created mini-habitats for the sustenance of all kinds of birds. Thus, it can be a great place to educate yourself or children.

Reaching there in the morning is preferable as one gets to attend to the penguin feeding session, bird shows of more than one type. Such shows are repeated after 1-2 P.M. So plan accordingly.

At the ticket-counter, they offer a tram service for another SG$5/-, which can be taken if you have difficulty in walking as the park is not really too big and can be easily covered on foot. However, the tram is great help for the persons with walking difficulties.

Snacks available in the Bird park are of limited variation and slightly expensive. Its advisable to carry your own snacks as all the walking can make you really hungry.
Staff at the Bird Parks are really friendly. There are designated photo-booths where they click the pics and you get to carry hard copy. However, only if you ask for better deals, they will divulge the 'better options'. So ask and perhaps negotiate a little.

Saw some amazing birds. Beautiful colours of all the birds, especially the parrots. There are several walk through aviaries and an amazing enclosure with huge waterfall and abundance of beautiful coloured birds inside. Saw some birds that I has never seen before - a toucan, some hornbill ( amazing looking creatures ), amazing snow owls, bright flamingos.
Make sure that you see the parrot show - these birds are so clever, so colourful and just amazing to watch. Was lucky enough to get one to sit on my arm - was the highlight of my trip there.

I was a tad dissapointed whilst wandering around though honestly. The food was very overpriced, although it did come with a souvenir cup. The park itself was large, and had a few hills. For someone like me who has physical illnesses, I found it difficult in the heat. I did see transportation go past in the grounds, but I couldn't see any signage around as to what it was or the cost if any. I did however see the bird park had wheelchairs and prams for rent which was great. As for the birds, 8 felt a bit sorry for them. Their enclosures seem to have everything they need in there, but some of them seemed a bit cramped. The bird show I saw was good, but it wasn't very interactive with the audience which was a shame, and it seemed that if you got there early and sat up front, then you were punished by not being one of the chosen few who got to interact with the birds. They did however offer free photos at the end, but tbh It felt as if you'd be giving them the rights to use your image by letting them take your photo, and so I sadly declined. Jurong bird park has the makings of a great place, and the staff were lovely for the most part. I hope peoole see the potential in this bird park, and it continues to grow with time and money invested.",10-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 17:58:02.549717

The open plan nature of the attraction is absolutely delightful for enjoying the natural behaviour of the birds at their very best and fantastic for educating kids (and adults!) about the ecosystem. The birds here are very well taken care of and all of the birds I saw looked very healthy and happy :).

I had a thoroughly good time at all of the bird shows especially the ""High Flyers Show"" where I volunteered myself to hold onto two toucans on each arm while they performed some acrobatics. ""Lunch With Parrots"" (it costs about 25SGD for the buffet lunch and to see the show) was also very fun where I got to dine al fresco and watch parrots do some abstract painting haha.

You will need at least 3 hours in Jurong Bird Park to be able to see all the shows and exhibits without rushing. Bring a bottle of water with you as it can get very hot walking around the park and some mosquito spray to ward off the mozzies.

1. It is easy to get here via public transport. Exit Boon Lay MRT Station, then enter Boon Lay Bus Interchange and take bus 194 for 1 stop to alight at Jurong Bird Park.
2. There are sufficient public amenities like washrooms and F&B outlets. Alternatively, have meals before / after your trip at Jurong Point Mall located at Boon Lay MRT.
3. The Lory Loft and Waterfall Aviary are 2 large enclosures which mimic natural environments. They also allow visitors to feed and interact with the birds, providing great fun and photo opportunities.
4. There are some informative areas, such as the Discovery Centre as well as the Breeding and Research Centre.

Cons:
1. Other enclosures did not particularly impress me. Some enclosures were small or had pungent smells.
2. The Birds of Prey show might be disturbing to some visitors (e.g. young children), as there is a fake bloody carcass which the vultures fly to and pretend to feed on.

Tips:
1. Locals can download a voucher from the Jurong Bird Park website to enjoy 51% off the admission. This National Day promotion is valid from 1st to 31st August.
2. The circular path around the park can be completed by foot at a leisurely pace in 3 to 4 hours.
3. Pokemon Go players can find many Pokestops and Pokemons here. That said, do be safe and take time to enjoy your surroundings!",08-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 17:58:10.569005

The park has a bird conservation program and helps with endangered species.

There are a number of shows morning and afternoon with trained birds of different breeds entertaining park visitors.

The complex is not particularly large although a basic fitness level would be good as the park is quite hilly.

There is a small tram that runs around the main path, there are only three stops where maybe ten or twelve would give flexibility to elderly or special needs guests.

I would have seen more - after walking and exploring the first third of the park I had to catch the tram and missed out on some really nice exhibits.

A ride by tram which takes 20 minutes around the park.There is commentary so one can know what one is seeing. one can stop at each junction and visit the birds before getting on the tram again. The other option is to do the entire stretch by walk which would be my recommendation so one can take some great pictures of the birds up close. so, start your day early incase you are planning to visit this place.

Getting up close with the birds in some aviaries was quite cool, allows for some lovely photographs to be shot. The park has a few photo opportunities that you can purchase if you desire.

The man-made waterfall was great, perfect location for a snap. I took a walk from here back to the end location allowing me to see a few extra birds I would have missed by purely catching the tram, only a 15 minute easy walk and well worth it.

The below is the conversation I had with the parrots photo booth at the entrance:
Me: How much is the photo?
Staff: SGD$50 for 1 photo. (while you can have SGD$25 for lunch with parrots, which does not make sense at all)
Me: We will not buy it.
Your staff: What about 50% off. SGD$25 for 1 photo.
Me: We will not buy it.
Your staff: LAST CHANCE. SGD$20 for 1 PHOTO.

We then walked away. Quoting an outrageous price SGD $50 for 1 photo?
Discount offered? That means the price quoted is not fixed and you can bargain with the price?
Is it a park owned business or privately operated business at Jurong Bird Park?
Such method of price quotation really deter tourists from having enjoyable moments at the park.

2. Poor staff training and miscommunication among staff
Before I made my visit to Jurong Bird Park, I have asked the staff whether it is possible to redeem the Lunch with Parrots with the iVenture cards. The reply I received is positive and clearly stating that I can redeem at the restaurants. However, the staff at the restaurant have no idea what I am talking about when I made the visit. The staff even consulted with his boss and the result is still remains negative. That differs from what just said by your CS staff via email.

We spent about 2.5 hrs here, could easily have spent another 2 hours or so. The place has a few steepish hills that I found a little difficult but there were plenty of seats available to give the knees a rest, also there is a ""train"" system operating around the park. I would suggest a full circuit on this to get your bearings to what you want to see, timings and distances for the shows that are on offer. The waterfall enclosure was spectacular although you really have to search for the birds here. In the other enclosures most of the birds were accustomed to people so were not that skittish, therefore great photos. The big disappointment was the 1"" square heavy wire mess frontage to some of the cages - some cages had large plexiglass panels which permitted better photography. I watched the ""parrot"" show which was very good and permitted you to get up close for the good photos, unfortunately I missed the raptor show.
Please note that this sanctuary is being relocated in the near future to the same area as the zoo, I was assured the new location has much better housing for the birds and better photographic opportunities.",12-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 18:00:21.299661

There is a wide variety of exhibits - from the informative and entertaining shows, to the hands on enclosures to the static displays.

Do not usually visit zoos etc etc as don’t agree with most of them but as this was touted as free flying with a large variety of birds thought we would visit.

The park is vast with a lot of free flying aviaries where we could feed the birds which was nice to do. The whole park is very natural looking and most of the birds looked well and happy although we did find one or two cages a little small

Went to a number of the shows throughout the day which we found informative and fun.

I always loved to come here ever since I went as a small kid even though I don't live in Singapore. Many of the birds could be spotted, if you just try hard enough to look for them. Unfortunately a part of the birds of prey exhibit was under renovation when I visited with my friends and that was a bit of a shame. Nevertheless, there are still many cool birds to see. The Lory Loft was crowded and very few lories came to feed from our bird food cup so that was kind of a downer (granted we did come on Vesak Day). They were probably all well-fed already by the previous visitors; we came there around past noon. We had wanted to go to the Waterfall Aviary as well since that was like the main attraction for us but unfortunately again, it rained very hard and we couldn't enjoy that part of the trip. Me and my friend just went and ran into the rain anyways though hahaha. Could be nice for atmospheric rainy shots too near the waterfall which was a very nice scene even in the pouring rain. My tip for visiting here? Definitely go with friends and family, that always makes thing a whole lot more fun. Check the weather forecast first, sunny to cloudy days are the best and you should avoid rain when going here at all costs. The place is pretty big so we did do a hefty amount of walking but if you're used to that, the park will be no problem. If not, you can get a park train ticket for $4 or $5 per adult I'm not sure I forgot. The layout of the place is very convenient as well, it's pretty much a big circle and you'll visit all exhibits by going one round around it which is neat. Food and beverage wise? Those weren't our top priority when visiting because we were too fixated on the awesome birds haha. There are water refill stations around the place and vending machines which is nice. Not a whole lot of food areas scattered around though, they're mostly situated near the entrance. But at least that keeps the park clean too! Check out their website as well it has many useful information! Overall a really nice experience in Jurong Bird Park with me and my friends.",05-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 18:00:47.817942

They have an amazing collection of birds ,pelicans ,flamingos ,herons ,macaws, parrots ,toucans ,pigeons ,owls ,hornbills ,peacocks,penguins ..
Make sure you cover the whole park
Enjoy the bird feeding ,it's quite unique

Our team members were made up of mostly seniors (above 60 years old). We were very grateful to the staff for their considerations and accommodation!
Visually captivating - our seniors were liven up by the vibrant colours, vast variety of birds and their flights also energized them! Most of them had not visited the Jurong Bird Park for more than 10 years. It was reminiscing and they did a walk down the memory lane.

Inclusive - We also noticed that the multi-lingual introduction panels at Lory Loft included Braille for the visually-impaired visitors. There are regular tram services and gradual slopes to facilitate mobility.

Our seniors were happy with the team bonding session carried out and created a lot more happy memories at the Hanging Bridge, Waterfall Aviary and Heliconia Walk. Thank you Jurong Bird Park!",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 18:00:56.889877

This was not the first time I came to this Bird Park. The last two occasions we were fascinated by the bird shows but this time I just walked around quickly to have a glimpse if there is anything different. Frankly speaking, I don;t really have much interest in aviary species and even if they appeared very colorful to me, I don't really will read more about it.

But I was surprised to see one section of the park labeled as `Dinosaur Descendants' and include such birds like Emu, ostrich, etc. How does dinosaurs evolved into birds? How does feathers and wings formed in dinosaurs? I was curious and started reading up on this area and found that evidence were found in fossils linking similar bone structure between one type of dinosaurs and birds. Similarity was also found in the evolution of the skull. I really could not believe this theory. But scientists are talking about evolution over millions of years and I thought of Darwin and the evolution of man from apes.

As I returned to the main hall of activities and looking out from the glass door, I could see the stunning view of the many beautiful and colorful flamingos playing in the lake. But deep in my mind, I still wondered if these meek and slender flamingos could have evolved from dinosaurs.

It is thought provoking this time to visit the Jurong Bird Park and strongly suggest you visit the park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. .",01-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 18:01:05.910583

Take your time here. If you just run through the park you'll be the usual suspects- pelicans, flamingoes, penguins. If you take your time, you'll see the smaller birds, the exotic birds, the amazing bird shows.

At the main entry there are penguins and once you reach inside there are varities of birds some of them which i have never seen before.The birds are caged in seperate categories like ""birds of prey"", ""pelican cove"" etc. There is a tram service available inside the park but am unsure about the ticket price.

The Lory Loft is perhaps the family favourite. Purchase the feed and the experience you get is worth the ticket price. There's a waterplay area for young ones. So bring a change of clothes if you are visiting with kids who can't resist getting wet.

It's now very commercialized, with rides and shows. The most annoying part -- a sponsorship by the Smurf movie series, which leads to thousands of plastic Smurfs being placed among the exhibits. We saw more Smurfs than birds, and it was too distracting.

You also get to see man made waterfall and aviary. Don't miss the shows. They are awesome especially king of skies and high flier show. Also the best time i enjoyed was with parrots. There are variety of parrots and it was fun with them. If you go early morning it will be really good. I went at afternoon and reached there at 2.

There are lots of things to do for the children, including a splash zone, so take their swim gear/sun screen. Also, the food is terrible, so pack a picnic.",06-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 18:02:19.195043

We enjoyed the lorry lift , where you could buy food for the lorikeets. The lorikeets weren't shy and you would find yourself with about 5 or more birds hanging off your hand trying to get food.
We also enjoy the bird show it is well worth making sure you have time to see it.
We walked around but you can catch a tram around it you prefer.

The place is very well maintained. Lots of variety of birds. You need to really walk to see all the different birds in the different enclosures. The tram rides don't really do justice to the park. I love the Lori enclosure and the Parrot enclosure the most. Food and snacks are overrated here. Best to bring your own food. Umbrella and cameras are a must. If you must go for the shows, best to do them on 2 days. One day for the show and the other for the real walk around the park.",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 18:02:19.906643

1) lack of interaction with the birds , (malaysia -KL bird park i could interact with most of the birds and even bird feeding was free , here it was charged at 3SG$)
2) most of them are caged
3) very big enough (4/5+ hours minimum to cover the entire bird park if you attend the shows happening on each day)
4) the photo frames are expensive ( 20SG$ minimum)
However the good things are kids are definitely gonna love this place . With kids , one should never miss all the shows happening at the bird park . There are about 10 attractions in the park and on each day atleast 3/4 attractions have shows .
Make sure to reach the bird park as early as 9 am to visit all the shows .
Some shows are exclusively alloted for weekends or particular weekdays

Pricing : We took the 68 SG$ pass ( Bird Park + Zoo + River Cruise + Night Safari) and i would recommend everyone to take this as its cheap
There is a mini VAN kind of vehicle available in the bird park where old people can sit on it and tour the entire bird park without walking . i Guess it was 10 SG$ to use that facility

JBP has attractions on either side of a trail-you can thus walk and stop at each attraction, tick it off your map and be done in 3 hours! The tram bypasses lots of the attractions (takes you to key stops)- you would then need to backtrack to cover the rest- which ends up being a pain! You can make it as leisurely or as rushed as you want it.
Still- the lory loft is adorable coz the lories are brilliantly colourfully friendly! The large aviaries are wonderful just because the sight of birds flying uplifts you after the cages! Waterfall aviary is impressively man-made. Penguins are an adorable must see!
It can get hot, very sweaty and dehydrating. Take sunglasses. The gift shop is a joke (stuffed animal toys) (what!?!).

Take 194 bus from bus interchange located down of MRT station. it will drop outside jurong bird park.I recommend at least to spend 4 hours in the park and one should try to go early in the morning to avoid the sun.

Park is not that big but Plenty of wide variety of birds. Both the shows The High Flyers(11 am, 3 pm) and the Kings of the Skies (10 am, 4 pm) are must watch. Even the bird feeding event is very good experience.

Single adult entry ticket is 26 SGD but If you are planning a Zoo visit or wildlife safari then buying a four park pass might be the way to go as the individual ticket prices are significantly cheaper when buying a multi park pass.(approx 62 SGD , 4 parks).

The tram is useful to get an overview of the park or take a break from walking for a while. Shuttle service will drop you to Pioneer MRT while leaving.

Even my non bird loving friends loved this attraction. I could have spent all day but had to leave around 2. Get there at 830 when birds are active or early evening. The two shows we saw were highlights. Birds of Prey show giant bald eagles, vultures, condors, kites, owls and a cheeky kingfisher who kept stealing their treats. Simply amazing how well trained these free flying carnivores were. Soaring directly over the audience it made me cry with joy! The High Flying show was for the waterbirds (comic relief) and the super smart parrots. Macaws, toucans, our Aussie cockatoo, hornbills, amazons etc. showing off their intelligence and flying skills. All the birds were simply mimicking their natural foraging, flying skills nothing that any of them would be uncomfortable.

It's an ideal size that will not tire out people, yet provide enough sights to delight. The main show is awesome, however many times I've seen it.

They've made the effort to revamp the place in shades so that it always feels a bit new. I like how they have set up mobile snack points, albeit in need of healthier snack options as well.

Yet.... I cannot help but feel sad walking around. Such beauty belongs in the wild (yeah, I'm a bleeding heart) and space limitation (and zoo animal management) requires that some of the creatures are confined to an area that inhibits their natural behaviour. This was exhibited by the fact quite a few animals were showing signs of stress, and depression.

It is a mixed argument about this. I do wish visitors will find out more about conservation and pass these precious lessons to their kids - there isn't a more fantastic place to do that.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 18:02:54.207558

朝から行くことをオススメします。
なぜなら鳥のショーや餌やり体験などは、午前と夕方の時間に固まっているからです。

せっかく行くのなら、ただ鳥を見学するだけじゃなく、ショーや餌やり体験した方が楽しいです。

★オススメポイント1:Show
ショーも、基本的に参加型で、客席近くを鳥が飛び回ったり、会場全体を使うので臨場感があります。
英語が少しできるなら、ショーの途中で、選ばれた人だけ肩に鷹を乗せたり、蛇に触ったりする体験があるので、おすすめします。

★オススメポイント2:Feeding
餌やり体験は、とっても楽しいです。
私たちはオウムの餌やりをしましたが、餌が入ってるカップを持っているだけで、たくさんの鳥が集まってきました。
頭に乗ってきたり、iPadに止まってきたり！
友だちや周りの参加者と、きゃーきゃー言いながら楽しみました。
時間ぴったりに間に合わなくても、餌を売ってくれるので大丈夫です。

★オススメポイント3:Watching
日本と違って、とにかく柵がないのが、シンガポールの動物園の特徴だと思います。
のびのびとした環境だからか、動物たちも元気に飛び回っていたり、鳴いていたり、見ている方も動きがあると楽しいです。

☆やらなかったこと
確か、鳥たちと一緒にレストランで、ブレックファースト、ランチ、ディナーを出来る体験があったのですが、私たちは、翌日にシンガポールズーでオラウータンとのブレックファーストを控えていたので、時間とお金の節約のため、やりませんでした。
なので、感想は言えません。

★アクセス
朝から楽しく遊んで、ショーも見て、餌やりもやって、満足したので、
昼過ぎくらいの無料シャトルバスに乗って、リバーサファリに行きました。

(ちなみに、行きは、シティ近くのホテルからシャトルバス出てるようですが、
私たちオープンに合わせて入場したかったので、ホテルからタクシーに乗りました)

★チケット
事前にネットで、買うとお得です。

シンガポールズー・リバーサファリ・バードパーク・ナイトサファリをまとめて購入しました。

★まとめ
ショーや餌やり体験が魅力的なので、シンガポールに来たら行った方がいいと思います。
時間的には、一日中かかるわけではないので、(私たちは朝から1時半くらいまでで全部回れました)午後から他の用事を入れることもできます。

I would recommend to firstly taking the tram to get a good feel of the place. You can hop on and hop-off several times on the tram so one doesnt have to cover the entire park on foot. As soon you enter one should find out the various timings of the shows and encounters and plan visiting the other sections accordingly. Feeding the birds at lorry loft was awesome fun!! Dont miss that. Let the birds sit on your heads, shoulders fingers etc. They are totally safe and playful. Total duration was about 3-4 hours.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 18:02:55.692449
