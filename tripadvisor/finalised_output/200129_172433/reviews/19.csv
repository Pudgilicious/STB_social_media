Clarke Quay was a place which I first saw during the famous touristical river cruise, which last more or less 45 minutes and saw how the place looked like from the river side. On next day,I went by metro to see it live, by day and used the chance to eat there. It's quite empty during the day but I guess it worths to be there during the night, when it should be much more animated and noisy. The place is nice to see, but honestly speaking, nothing really exceptionnal, except maybe the view on Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
I will soon add some photos to my review for you to see what I'm talking about.

All water facing, they look over Singapore River and glow during the evening with vibrancy and are generally always busy.

There are some British and Irish style bars, seafood dine-in restaurants and a Hindi-music playing club among many others.

The Quay is also a short walk from The Fullerton Hotel and nearby bridges such as Anderson and Elgin Bridge can be used to cross the river.

We stayed in the area, in a hotel nearby, and sat looking over the river one night and the lights sprawling across Singapore City. This area is certainly one of the more lively areas you’re likely to find in Singapore.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 01:21:18.443295

Our hotel - The Miramar, was located across the river from Robertson Quay which is a relatively short walk to Clarke Quay. When I researched accommodation in Singapore and after speaking to our travel agent we did decided we wanted to be near Clarke Quay which is a tourist mecca.

We often walked from our hotel along the river to Clarke Quay but mainly during the day. On our last night we visited the Clarke Quay area at night and couldn't believe how the area came alive with people. All the restaurants were open along with night clubs and it had a vibrant feel to it.

Definitely worth a visit at night and for the river boat cruises during the day. We were glad that stayed in the area and wouldn't hesitate in going back.",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 01:21:18.825270

I went for a quick bite on Xmas eve and I just order 10 pcs of traditional hooter wings and 2 small btl of water (me and my wife).
After roughly 40 min of waiting, they bring me BBQ American wings which was not what I ordered and I send it back.
I immediately understood that something was wrong with my order since I keep seeing staff around with that wrong order, kind of panicking and pass the plate to each other.
No worries I work in f&b industries as well, i can understand, so I decided to wait a bit more but I asked what happened, and they said they send my food to another table (so they basically did try to give me the food of that table seeing if I might not realise).
After another 10 min the food didn't arrive so I decided to leave and I asked the bill:
amazingly after nearly 50 min waiting for my food that never arrived, they had the brave to give me the bill of 2 water $4.70.
At that point, I called the ""manager"" (i believe Filipino or Malay/Indo) and I asked if for him it's correct that after wait 50 min and never get my food I pay 2 small btl of water. His answer was ""yes if you are in f&b you should know how does it work in Xmas eve!""
Fair enough I shake his hand I paid and I left, but now dear ""manager"" enjoy the 1 star review, it's all for U!! Merry Xmas bro :* !!

Whether you wish to book a river cruise, experience the vast shopping mall, or relax and eat near the river watching the world go by, then there is something for everyone to do.

The mall itself is not for the faint hearted for sure. Multiple floors and a colour coding system to get your head around, but once mastered it then becomes quite easy to navigate. The basement area is a vast array of the most fabulous eateries. Reasonably priced with some essential shops added for good measure too.

There are some fabulous clothing boutiques as well as stores aimed at the tourist market.

One thing you will notice about the mall and surrounding area, it is scrupulously clean and well kept and there are concierge that can speak English and aid with certain requirements if one feels a little daunted.

I had the most amazing chilli chicken and noodles from a fixed price menu. $6. Excellent value and so tasty. A good way of seeing which are the better areas to eat at is to look to see where the locals migrate too. Whilst there may be a language barrier. The menus are visual which makes it a lot easier to order from!

The bars are a little expensive, however a lot cheaper than drinking in the hotel. There quite literally is something for everyone. A hive of activity day and night!",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 01:22:22.472956

From a distance all the little restaurants and bars lining the river appear to be the perfect place for a romantic meal but you'd be better eating somewhere else. The restaurants looking out over the river are more interested in squeezing as many tourists in as physically possible than anything else. We ended up paying $120 for a very substandard meal (1 starter, 2 mains, no desserts or drinks).

I would suggest eating somewhere else beforehand and just take a stroll up here in the evening and stop off in a few places for a drink. The atmosphere walking around is lovely and theres loads of street acts and performers to keep you entertained.",11-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 01:25:12.833205

During the day it is relaxing with little shops and places to eat. By night it goes mad with live music, bars, restaurants and clubs. The place is great fun and you can sit on the bridge and veg out if you want. There is a little shop which sells cheaper beer if you can find it then sit on the bridge and listen to the chaos.
The slight downside is that it is expensive to drink alcohol in Singapore, twice the price of British pubs. The advantage is that you are outside in 75 degree heat and get all the entertainment as an extra. The place itself at night has the fountains as a centerpiece and they are not to be missed. By day the kids play in it, by night it changes colour. Food is not that expensive in comparison to the alcohol. Clarke Quay has its own MRT station which is under the shopping mall. It is a bit of a hike to get out but once out its great.
Its best to go before happy hour which finishes at 2100. The local brew is Tiger Beer which is okay but I found a place serving the Australian VB which I much prefer. After happy hour the prices can vary, up to S$18 so be selective about where you drink. Look out for special promotions such as ladies night where girlies get 2 for 1. My Wife fell in love with Lychee Martinis. This is a little bit of madness in an otherwise ordered country. Go there its great fun.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 01:25:20.917626

It was a night visit but it seemed fairly low key. Not much excitement going on but it did seem the place to be if you were looking for some fun and drinks.

Years later I was able to come back and see how it has changed so much. The Quay has a great number of restaurants, pubs, bars and what appears to be dance clubs.

During the day it is fairly low key. Not much going on. In the evenings towards sunset, the place starts to pick up significantly.

I had a late lunch at the Hooters here with a plan to visit the Night Safari later. The Hooters seems to have changed a bit from my last visit but it is still a good time with good food. They also appear to have an outdoor seating area now.

Towards the end of the key closest to the Bay is the reverse bungee machine if you are into thrill seeking. At this point you can start to get a good view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel that looks like a boat on supports. Photo added.

It is easy to get to the Quay via taxi or MRT. The cost of entertainment and food at the Quay is mid range. No real cheap eats here. There are some photo opportunities for the FB selfie crowd. My main like about the Quay is it is clean, organized and there is little chance of getting run over like in many other venues around Asia similar to this.

It does rain a bit in Singapore and we nearly got caught in it. There are enough covered areas in the Quay that you are able to move around a bit or continue on with your festivities outdoors without fear of being soaked.",07-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 01:25:21.962218

The ride cost $25 per person and I believe it was good value. The narration with historical information was useful and images of what Singapore used to be like in bygone years were shown on a television screen at the front of the boat, giving a then and now perspective.

Our timing was perfect as we were able to see the buildings and quays gradually light up. It was a very impressive sight.

We didn't eat at Clarke Quay because we weren't hungry at that time so, after a walk around and a look in Central Mall and Liang Mall, decided to leave. By this time, around 8.30 p.m., it was becoming very crowded.

There are number of themed bars & restaurants, such as Wings, which is an aviation 'Top Gun' style location. Others include Bollywood, the Highlands and Aussie bar types.

There is plenty of nightlife with the whole area getting so crowded and lively during the night time. The bright neon lights and the sound of bands coming out from the bars and nightclubs makes the place very vibrant.

You can walk through the street by the side of the river, shop at the numerous shops or dine at any of the riverside restaurants, with excellent views of the Singapore river. There are plenty of discotheques and night clubs also making it a partygoer’s paradise.

You can take the river cruise from Clarke Quay or Boat Quay. We went for a 30 minutes cruise from Liang Court passing by Riverside Point, Clarke Quay, Coleman Bridge, Boat Quay, Financial District, Raffles Landing Site, Asian Civilisations Museum, Fulleron and Cavenaugh Bridge, Merlion, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Esplanade and back to Liang Court. There were hardly five people in the boat, but the ride was really enjoyable.

Later we walked down the street to have dinner at Jumbo Seafood, one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city. You can find plenty of restaurants serving different cuisines form various parts of the world.

Clarke Quay river side restaurants are perfect for relaxing in the evenings, while enjoying the river views and the city of Singapore.

A bottle of Water is $6AUD and most restaurants sell or dont serve any water at all which I think is terrible. I guess they just want you drink alcohol. So BYO water.

So here's a little guide to help. There are bars like tipsy gypsy near the Clarke quay mrt that have 3 Heineken for $12. There is a 7/11 in boat quay which is just a short walk down from a bar called skinnys lounge that serves tap tiger beer for $5 which is the cheapest I saw. Outside is a seating area where you can sit next to the river drinking it too. There is a nice place called SQUE which is a long outdoor dining area at riverside (across bridge from Clarke quay) which has 1 for 1 drink specials all day up to 11pm i think. I picked up two tigers for $12 one night and my sister 2 cocktails for $18. That's cheap in this area believe me.
Food is also ridiculous at Clarke quay so if want a cheaper option go to Liang court. They have asian dishes between $5 - $15 and is right next to Clarke quay. I would also suggest visiting satay by the bay in gardens by the bay which was lovely and pretty cheap. Of course there is the food inside shopping malls too and this includes marina bay sands. Food court on lower floor.is large and cheap.

If you want to go there I noticed Boat quay seems like a bit of red light district with a few girly bars. There are many working girls at Clarke quay too especially at a bar called highlander which has an age limit for men (no men under 28 and now I know why :) Music was good but Beer here is about $17. Clarke quay is nice but so expensive and I have been to.tokyo and it's far worse than that.

INSIDE THE CLARKE QUAY CENTRAL MALL:
If I remember correctly, only 3-4 floors are dedicated for the mall. The mall itself is smaller compared to the other malls I've been to in SG. I was disappointed to stroll around as some of the boutiques closes as early as 5pm. With the very few boutiques to check out from, I haven't bought any here. As for the foodcourt area, since the mall is small, it only has a few selection. Good thing that you can eat in the restaurants outside; just be ready to spend but if you're on a budget you can go to a nearby mall which is just a walking distance from this mall.

As soon as you stepped out of the mall, you're already in the SINGAPORE RIVER because it's just a few steps from the mall. Going here in the late afternoon is best so you can see the beauty around and you can feel the cool breeze of the river. I can't believe that back in the 1970's, the river is horribly dirty. The best time to do a river cruise is during the sunset until the time it darks so you can see the beauty of the places around with and without lighting. The fee for a roundtrip boat ride is $25/pax. On your cruise, you can see the Marina Bay Area. You can also alight here if you wish too so you don't need to ride a cab or MRT just to get there.

CLARKE QUAY RIVERSIDE RESTAURANTS:
It is best to visit this place at night time because this is a place where you can drink and dine with your family or friends. Dining at one of the restaurants beside the river is a unique experience as you can feel the cool air at night, enjoy the great music around and mesmerized with the lights around. One of the most famous place here is the Hooters but this is not recommended for a group with kids, otherwise, a couple can enjoy dining in one of the fine dining restos here.

There’s something for everyone in a great setting along the canal/river which is still compact enough that you can wander past just about all of the dozens of bars before settling on your favourite. Alternatively, spend the entire night doing a bar crawl and checking out the music!

The area draws a really eclectic mix of people of all ages and with different interests. You can go proper clubbing or you can just as easily sit at an Irish pub and listen to some classic pub tunes.

Most places are open until the early hours of the morning, so visiting Clarke Quay is something you can do without any trouble if you’ve got a dinner reservation elsewhere in the city.

The are heaps of restaurants out in the open on both sides of the river with quite a lot of cuisines to chose from .. if you don't want to eat, it is great to have a few drinks and just chill out.

,1,19,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,646479423,17-01-2019,5,Warning: Highly Addictive!,"If repeat visits are the yardstick, Clarke Quay must be my personal #1 attraction in Singapore: I go there all the time. I took my Thai partner there once, and Nok insisted on returning every night. On our last visit, we were showing some American friends around SE Asia and took them to Clarke Quay on our second night; they insisted on returning every night after that. I and an American friend both stay at hotels close to Clarke Quay whenever we go to Singapore. I reviewed my pick--Park Hotel Clarke Quay—in TA a few years ago; he stays elsewhere, but addiction to Clarke Quay is the common driver for both our choices.

From Lighters to Lee: Once upon a time when Victoria reigned, deep-draught ships would arrive off Singapore laden with coals from Newcastle or what-have-you, and moor offshore. Flat-bottomed lighters would head out to the ships, take off their cargo, and scull up the shallow Singapore River to godowns (warehouses) where the cargo would be stored for transshipment. Lighters then sculled back with tea from China, cloves from the Indies and other outbound cargo to the ships. Godowns lined both banks of the river all the way up to Clarke Quay and beyond. The Chinese lightermen were the nexus between the godowns and the ships. Singapore godowns were the nexus beween the Yangtze and the Hooghly, Yokohama and Bombay, Asia and the West. I’ve seen black-and-white films of the lighters and bumboats on the Singapore River in the ‘20s, and the sheer level of activity is astonishing. But nothing lasts forever, and with the development of modern port facilities, deep-water vessels now load and unload cargos via cranes shoreside, while lighters, bumboats and riverside godowns were all rendered obsolete. “Thank heavens, about time” as far as aggressive real-estate developers were concerned, since that meant they could now demolish all the godowns and build prime-market riverfront high-rises like Maybank Tower in their place. But, as the wrecking balls moved inexorably upriver, the wise government of Lee Kwan Yew intervened. Prime Minister Lee always took the long view, and noted the unconstrained demoliton of Singapore’s historic areas with a jaundiced eye. His government mandated that the godowns of Clarke Quay should be restored, preserved, and converted to other commercial uses, and that construction on other quays along the river should reflect the unique historic architecture of the river-banks. After his retirement, rules were relaxed, but without Prime Minister Lee, there would be no Clarke Quay today.

Visually Stunning: Take one look at Clarke Quay today and it’s plain to see that Lee’s commendable goal of historic preservation has been substantially—what’s the nautical term?--chucked overboard, altered course, run aground?—something like that. But the good ship SS Clarke Quay hasn’t been entirely sunk: if you keep your eyes down and stare along the waterline, Clarke Quay does have the look and feel of those old godowns, even if the originals weren’t painted in pastel colours.

Hexa-functional Brollies: If you raise you eyes up to rooftop level, however, your view is dominated by a spectacular network of ultra-modern, gigantic, inter-connected umbrellas (I extolled their virtues in a TA review of Kuala Lumpur’s Chinatown a few years ago, where similar structures pale by comparison). Now, a proper British brolly is strictly single-purpose: it just keeps you dry when it rains. But an ombrelle in France had at least two raisons d'être: as a parapluie it (1) protects you from the rain, and as a parasol it (2) protects you from the sun’s heat. In the tropics, you’ll still see brollies used for both these reasons: try hiking around Jaipur or Bangkok in hot season, and you’ll start using one yourself. In the West, parasols were also once used because they (3) kept milady’s complexion as pale as possible. Having seen many a Western lass working on her tan in Miami, Copacabana, Bondi and Sentosa, I conclude the odds of any of them actually wanting snow-white complexions nowadays are considerably lower than the odds of their being addressed as “milady.” Still, throw it in and you’ve got a grand total of three functions.

Now, at Clarke Quay, those King Kong-sized umbrellas serve six—count ‘em—six different purposes:

(1) Keeping you dry: the brollies are right over the pedestrian walkways, and interconnect, so rainwater will flow from brolly to brolly and finally cascade into gutters that divert it away; hence, you can wander through Clarke Quay dry-shod in a monsoon deluge.
(2) Keeping you cool: between their cooling system and shade, the brollies can reduce Clarke Quay’s ambient temperatures by up to 4 degrees Celsius (7 Fahrenheit), quite useful if you arrive at 4:00 pm on a real scorcher.
(3) Keeping you enthralled: after sundown the brollies begin a fabulous light-show, slowly morphing from one colour to the next; there aren’t too many 100% free nightly light shows anywhere; Da Nang’s Dragon Bridge is the only serious competitor I can think of in Asia.
(4) Keeping you occupied: it’s hard to ignore the spectacular brollies by day, and impossible by night, so you’ll be occupied not only enjoying the fabulous light show, but taking vast numbers of selfies, groufies, or just photos and videos of the view. Pick your restaurant, order, and then start taking stills and videos. You won’t be twiddling your thumbs, checking your watch, drumming your fingers, and wondering “when oh when will they ever come out with my porridge?”
(5) Keeping you coming: yes, Clarke Quay is an upscale eating, drinking, and shopping complex, but Singapore has lots of similar complexes, including riverside ones on other quays, and depending on exactly what you want, Clarke Quay might not be the best place to go. But it’s so spectacularly beautiful and unique—thanks to the brollies—that you just prefer to keep coming back, which is critical for Clarke Quay management and vendors; and finally
(6) Keeping milady’s complexion as pale as possible, which may be an obsolete concept in the West, but is still very much alive and kicking in Asia, to the point that I once caught Nok actually under-packing for a flight to Rangoon (“good heavens, are you ill?”) only to see her a week later cramming that suitcase to the gills with thanaka for herself, her daugher and other ladies back in Thailand, where they can’t obtain the legendary Burmese paste (“oh, now I get it.”).

The Smorgasbord: Take your pick of Asian: Clarke Quay has Chinese, Indian and Malay (Indonesian) restaurants, as well as Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai. Western choices include an Aussie seafood house, British and Irish pubs, a steakhouse, a Spanish tapas bar, German and Cuban restaurants, as well as more downscale taco joints, chicken wing joints, and many more that I didn’t mention. Oh yes, also lots of serious bars and other nightlife. I suspect a Clarke Quay location makes a restaurant or pub bit pricier than comparable establishments elsewhere in town (which is saying something, since Singapore is very expensive indeed compared to any other SE Asian capital) but I think you’re amply compensated by being here. And note: if you cross the Malacca Bridge to get to the right bank of the river, you’ll find another phalanx of restaurants, technically not part of Clarke Quay, but affording a better view if you can get an outdoor table: one of them is my standby, Breworkz. (They’ve decided to make the Malacca Bridge Read, but so far the bridge is still illiterate, so I still call it Malacca).

Entertainment Roulette: Sorry, Can’t Hear a Word You’re Saying: There’s a stage in the center of Clarke Quay where you can hear live music, as well as impromptu street musicians working from the opposite bank or playing from the middle of the bridge. The music’s a bit of a roulette wheel spin: sometimes you get a real winner; other times it’s not your cup of tea, and skull-splitting to boot. One time, a rock band at Clarke Quay was so loud that my waitress couldn’t hear my order: what made this memorable, was that I wasn’t even AT Clarke Quay—I was upriver at the far end of Richardson Quay! If you suffer from tinnitis you might want to carry along some ear-plugs. Despite that occasional nuisance, however, I can’t imagine our ever going to Singapore without spending at least one night at Clarke Quay, even during the wet season. Five stars of course! (see Clarke Quay by Day, Clarke Quay by Night, and Malacca Bridge photos).",02-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 01:29:47.305884

There are plenty of restaurants catering to almost any type of cuisine, all located among the renovated warehouse which have been part of the river for as long as one can remember.
Before dinner you can shop at nearby shopping centers or simply hang around and enjoy the scenic view as the sun sets. If you have a little time you can try riding one of the old fashioned bumboats that now cater to tourists and locals.
After dinner, choose to have drinks in one of the many bars or catch some live music or dance the night away. There is even a Kareoke studio on one of the second levels.
All in all its good fun whether you are there as a couple, a family, or with a group of friends.

But it is the ultimate testimony to the government's effort to clean up the river. Something visitors might like to go green about.

Worth a stroll - shopping around ""The Central"" & ""Liang Court"" in airconditioned comfort in the day.

The nocturnal scene erupts in the outdoors... the sidewalk cafes, the riverside bars.

Spot the Reverse Bungee fair ride, Jim Beaming through the pubs, Johnny Walker's wisdom running wild.

There's food too ...lots of yum - well appointed and accordingly priced.

Expect tourist types, bored expats, trendy young locals.

Curious Singaporeans cruise by to make up the numbers. Most are dating couples waiting to be moonstruck.

It is no wonder that the eateries and pubs lining the river, mostly fronted by Filipina wait staff, zoom in on foreigners rather than on locals.

At night, the lights are garish, the blared competing music noisy, the stiffling haze of second hand cigarette smoke (even in the open) bury any expectation of relief.

A night visit can be worth the experience. How much one spends depends on one's resolve and budget... though people watching can be just as fun and not plunder your wallet.

Considering the wharf, godowns and riverine trade related Raj-era structures (including bridges), now quaintly dressed and colored for different mercantile purposes, the place seems happily rejuvenated.

The abundance of like offerings, pricing practice and exposure to the elements ( rain & sun) should be addressed lest it start taking a toll on takings.",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:31:53.673090

We didn't want to go clubs, so we tried again and again to drive him away from us.(Even he looked like wanted to follow to our hotel) One side of Clarke Quay is full of clubs, so really crowded at late time, but the other side is quiet and calm, so we played at there. And also, I recommend you to bring umbrella, because we had to run to building to escape rain. Singapore's rain comes mostly in short time, but we're so embarassed during raining.",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:05.675619

Colorful exteriors, bars, pubs, small shops...it gives a very happening feel to the entire place. I took a river cruise to Marina Bay sands and it was very well managed and amazing experience. The boats r well kept, the cruise starts on time and takes you to the laser show at marina Bay.

I had a fun evening at clarke. Strongly recommend to visit this place.",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:06.030065

All the pubs, discos, clubs and sports bars are there. One can go for a boat dinner at Quay. Nice place to hangout with friends and family. You can also get a ride on reverse bungee there.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:06.394504

Probably more suitable for younger adults. Large crowds could be a problem for people with mobility issues.,01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:12.174995

Especially on friday and saturday there are a lot of people. The boat tours on the river give clarke quay an even more special feeling. I really loved that it is so colourful during nighttime! It is also easy to go there with the MRT. You have to take the north east line to get there. A must visit place in singapore especially when you are young!,11-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:12.478886

It gets more exciting as the night goes on and anytime you wanna leave there's taxi's galore. Check out the Japanese restaurant at the waterfront..the salmon got my vote. if youre not hungry there are plenty of pulsating bars to quench yr thirst and you can squeeze in a little stall side shopping as well.",09-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 01:33:12.882416
