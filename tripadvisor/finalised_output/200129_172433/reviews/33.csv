Living in Hong Kong i / we sorely miss something of that quality around victoria harbour. Despite many initiatives of local individuals or companies suggesting harbour vitalisation these have not found the interest of the rulers of Hong Kong who simply handed over Hong Kong to the local developers (end of moaning).

The waterfront promenade is best to visit at the beginnig of the sunset, then walking into the night from the bay towards and along Boat Quay and Clark Quay.

I loved the old iron bridges in front of the Fullerton hotel as well as the park in front of the historic building / museums in there.

We came during preparation time for the Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix and the fences everywhere - even in the park - did spoil the impression a bit.

A great walk in the evening ending up in a restaurant or bar at Boat Quay or Clarke Quay make this a certainly memorable ""must'walk"".",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 06:19:55.962484

One of the evenings we caught the MRT to Bayfront station to walk and watch the Supertree Groove lights display at 6:45, then we caught the MRT again to Raffles place to wander and watch the 8pm lights show from the steps by the Merlion - great view! Both light events are free and awesome. We would highly recommend the Waterfront Promenade show. It includes lasers, lights, fountains and a number of buildings. Lots of places for dinner and dessert in this area as well to make an evening of it. Some people were watching from the boats on the water, but it is more expensive and just as nice from the land. I think if you were on the Marina Sands side of the water you would not get the same experience with the lights on the buildings, but would see more of the water fountains.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-30 06:20:56.133735

I specially recommend to visit this place evening and keep at least 3-4 hours. We got down at raffles city MRT and started a walk from Fullerton Hotel went on to walk till Esplanade mall. On your way, you could spend some time at Merlion statue.At 8 PM, light show started from Marina bay by sands hotel and it was enthralling. Please watch this from Esplanade mall side. One could head enjoy a beer or drink at Esplanade mall. This takes almost a hour or so. Then through the park , walk again towards Fullerton hotel side and proceed walk along Singapore river.

Great way to see it is grab a water taxi and take a boat cruise around the Waterfont.

The most interesting parts are Helix Bridge, Merlion Statue (the big and the small one), the view on Marina Bay Sands Hotel and river cruise boats. It is really nice to do it by night, as the colors and light show in the evening are really of high quality and relaxing. Expect many people all around as this place is very touristic and many people like to make selfies all around the place.
Be aware of potential thunderstorms, which can start very fast and be very strong for a while. Try the river cruise also, which will give you the opportunity to see with different views of all the area. Last thing, the price for food in this area are very high compare with food price in Chinatown or in Little India.
I will soon add some photos to my review, for you to see what I'm talking about.

From here it is easy to access other parts of the marina such as the Fullerton area, the helix bridge to the gardens, and the Raffles Place area.

Having been numerous times since 1989, it is amazing to see the transformation of the area from an empty area of recently reclaimed land to what it is today.

Getting here is not too much of a problem, either go to the city hall or raffles place subway station. I particularly found the city hall station easier as I got disoriented in raffles place and the GPS can be a little weird next to the high rise buildings.

Now, can you find here? good food, a nice atmosphere and depending on the time people jogging, taking photos, hordes of tourists or people trying to relax and have nice food (at night). We were part of three of these groups as we do not run in Singapore ;)

I do need to warn you, early in the morning (or in the morning in general) everything is close. I am not quite sure when it gets active but if you drop by at 6 pm or later you will find it quite alive.

The recommendation here is: come at night to enjoy it, otherwise just walk past straight to the helix bridge or the Esplanade bridge as it will be sort of dead otherwise.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 06:27:21.638750

Although one morning we actually got caught in a humid thunderstorm which came out of nowhere! Having little protection made our way to shelter under a bridge near the Merlion close to Jubilee Walk the SG50 anniversary walkway. After about 30 minutes the worst was over but what a downpour!

The area itself is fantastic. You can see views of the Marina Bay Sands, Merlion, the business district lit up by night with multiple colours reflecting off the water. Visit Makansutra Gluttons Bay in the evening (which we can highly recommend for the local satay and casual drinks, an area of street food with views) onwards to The Helix bridge, lotus flower ArtScience museum, into The Shoppes Luxury shopping mall with restaurants. Outside the mall we had a great view of the evening light show.

Also of note, in this top area Singapore hold their Jazz Festival (approx March time, but check their website) which you can purchase tickets for, or just soak up the sounds of the live jazz bands sitting in bars nearby. Great atmosphere.

If you continue in this direction you can also walk to the Gardens by the Bay and Supertrees area.

So, we found a spot and waited for 4 hours. During our wait, we had a chance to talk with families around us and that helped to pass the time as we learned more about Singapore. Also, we were able to see two Wonder Full Light and Sound Shows that are visible from the promenade. I reviewed the Light and Sound Shows under a separate review.

As far as the fireworks go, it was not the best fireworks display we have seen. It is a beautiful location with Marina Bay below the fireworks and the incredible skyline just across the Bay, including the famed Fullerton Hotel and the Merlion at the Merlion Park.

Unfortunately, the Bay is like a fishbowl shaped like a horseshoe. Without a breeze, the smoke from the fireworks just hangs in the air and continues to accumulate. The first couple of minutes of the fireworks were spectacular because there was very little smoke. However, as the fireworks progressed to the entire 15 minutes, including the finale, the smoke really took away from the visual impact of the fireworks. In my opinion, they should have the finale first while the sky is still clear of the smoke.

Having been somewhat critical, it was still worth standing for 4 hours because it is a once in a lifetime opportunity. And, we talked with people and saw the Wonder Full Light and Sound show. The crowds after the fireworks were all going for the metro so it was shoulder to shoulder; added to the experience.",12-2015,Couples,2020-01-30 06:32:46.708726

There is an area right by the water where there is lots of seating for people watching the laser show (free). Here were hot food and drinks stalls and there was live music and it was lively.

Only issue was the whole promenade seemed to die at about 10pm (it was a weeknight). Restaurants were closing and people disappearing which was disappointing

we went to the promenade at marina bay sands and saw the light show for the second time, after first seeing it from a boat ride. Honestly - it's a completely different experience. The show has videos and images projected into water jets which are awesome and you just don't see any of this unless you're on the Marina bay sands side of the water.

There is an interesting night Laser display from atop Marina Bay Sands hotel- think only on weekends & at about 8-8.15pm.

Take the MRT to Esplanade station. Once on street level, one can easily see the skyscraper offices/ MBS in background. Start your walk from here towards there. You will see the sea, MBS, Esplanade, Merlion on the left of the promenade walk.

History buffs (who even says that?) can enjoy The Fullerton Hotel.

Architecture enthusiasts can marvel at the world's highest valued real estate in the MBS.

Romantics can wander hand in hand by the water.

Those more committed to the struggle can join a bootcamp or running group in the early evening.

Those made of money can eat crab and sip cocktails with a view.

The rest of us can go to Gluttons.

Everyone can be awed by the fact that what we are looking at is 'reclaimed land' and there is a reason why Beach Road is now far from the beach, and that Customs House is now a bar nestled inside a fresh water reservoir that is crucial to providing the country with its fresh drinking water, rather than a sinking colonial office on a boggy mangrove marsh.

I feel that it is so interesting to both the citizens who can identify with the story and tourists who can have a glimpse of the real country beyond the elegant shops and cosmospolitan eateries.
