Just get off of the chineese garden mrt and take a short walk to the park and you are there! The park is beautifully laid out and if you are looking for some quiet time this is the place to be. Traveling with a tiny baby under the age of two can be hectic. From fish to birds to lizards they have them all here and it sure keeps the little one entertained. Only drawback though is that the park has no eateries within the vicinity so you have to take your own food. It's best to travel in the morning as some of the trails are quite sunny. The park is free to all. Sadly the bonsai garden was closed during my visit. Most pagodas except for a very few are stroller accessible. Beautiful architecture and stunning craftmanship on the statues! Compaired to the botanical gardens this is quite smaller in size. However, this is one of the most quietest gardens I have been to.

The easiest way to the Chinese Garden in Singapore is by MRT that has a station just outside the garden. The station is rightly named Chinese Garden Station. The MRT (mass rapid transit) station entrance or the East Gate where the Red Bridge leads to the garden. The main gate or West Gate at Yuan Ching Road with the Main Arch Building is at the opposite end. The White Rainbow Bridge will take you across to two courtyards, namely the “Early Spring Courtyard” and “Garden Courtyard” and a fishpond in the center which is named the “Fishes Paradise”. The White Rainbow Bridge, a unique 13-arch bridge that was modelled after the famous 17-arch bridge at the Summer Palace in Beijing, China,

Chinese Garden is a large park with an area of 135,000 square meters in Jurong East, built in 1975 and designed by Professor Yuen-chen Yu from Taiwan and modeled on Chinese gardening art of imperial architecture and landscaping. It is opened daily from 6am to 11pm and entrance is free.
From the Garden there is a connecting bridge that leads to the adjacent Japanese Garden. A visit the both the gardens would be a good ideal for the attraction of two contrasting garden concepts. It would however take a strenuous effort of up to two hours of footwork. Many kiosks or huts dotted the both gardens to entertain the weary feet of visitors and to shelter from the hot sun and the unsuspecting rain.
Upon entrance via the MRT entrance a Red Bridge will lead the visitor to a seven floor pagoda that provides a useful lookout point. Four stone lions are stationed at the head of the Red Bridge to welcome the visitors. We found the climb up the pagoda quite fascinating as we navigate and stop at each floor to enjoy the views. The pagoda is actually two stories high per floor which makes the actual height fourteen stories. You can see the entire garden plus a good portion of the Japanese Garden from the top. At the base of the pagoda are statues of eight of the famous heroes of ancient China, seven male and one female, that was the famous lady general Hua Mulan.
You should engage a map or consult the directory posted at both entrance to navigate to all the rich features that the garden has to offer. Apart from the impressive East Entrance and the Main Arch Building, the Pagoda with the features of Heroes of folklore China at the base, the Stone Lion, the lovely White Rainbow Bridge, the Stone Boat and Tea House, the Garden of Abundance, the Bonsai Garden, and Pavilion, Plateau and Tower are the features not to be missed. There is also Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum which a small entrance fee is charged.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 05:46:03.170384

Hand on heart, we both rated the Chinese & Japanese Gardens for more highly, and enjoyed them a great deal more.

The Gardens are easy to get to: just hop on the MRT East West line (green) and get out at Chinese Garden. You'll see the pagoda peeking out over the trees, and a long, straight path takes you right there. The gardens are free entry.

There is a wonderful view over the gardens and surroundings from the top of the pagoda. The gardens are beautifully kept and as clean and tidy as you would expect of Singapore. The Chinese bonsai garden is utterly beautiful, and having been to the gardens in Suzhou, China, on which they are modelled, we can confirm that they are astonishingly accurate and well done. The trees are so beautiful, too.

Despite being at the gardens on a Saturday, we were astonished how few people were there. It was an absolute oasis of peace and tranquility, accompanied by the sound of birdsong.

There is nowhere to buy food, so you will need to take your own if you need to eat. There is a vendor selling reasonably-priced cold drinks and water at the entrance.

The highlight for us was a completely accidental one: we discovered three families of wild, smooth-coated otters in the Jurong River (on which the gardens were built). We stood for a very long time, watching them catching and eating fish, and playing with their pups. It was an absolutely magical once-in-a-lifetime event.

Drinks are available at the entrance and public toilets are available at a few locations. The paths are mostly flat and tarmac'd.
The buildings in the park are very modern and hence a bit fake. Don't expect ancient authentic buildings. More of a toned down Las Vegas regarding the architecture. The tower did give good views of the surrounding parkland.
There is an abundance of wildlife, both airborne and aquatic. The highlight for me were the Malaysian water monitor lizards cruising around the large pond and occasionally stomping around the edges. At first sight I thought it was a crocodile but nope! Just a 2 meter long water monitor. You are probably guaranteed to see these animals here.
The Bonsai garden is stunning. Great setting and a superb amount of atmospheric Bonsai. Many artistic pieces. I'm no Bonsai enthusiast but in my opinion it is an exceptional collection of Bonsai.

We were staying in Central Singapore, near Clarke Quay. Travel to the gardens was quite easy. We took a bus to an MRT station and then the East/West (Green) line to Chinese Garden Station. The Garden is a short walk from the station.

The gardens themselves are beautiful and my wife was amazed at how the area had changed since she was last here. We went to the top of the pagoda (7 stories, only stairs) and got a birds eye view of the gardens. Then we looked around the bonsai garden and went over the bridge into the Japanese Garden.

The 13.5 hectare park was built in 1975 and the Chinese Garden features bridges, pagodas, statues of Chinese heroes, lakes and ponds, a stone boat and tea house, the live Turtle and Tortoise Museum (admission charge) and a stunningly beautiful Bonsai Garden with over 2 000 examples of the art from all over Asia. Follow the winding paths around and over the lake and stop to enjoy the serenity at one of the many shaded resting areas.
We visited on a Tuesday when it was very quiet but, unfortunately, didn't get as far as the Japanese Garden as it started to rain. This is something to look forward to on our next visit.

A traditional Chinese garden will combine four elements: rock, water, plants and buildings, and will provide the visitor with interesting and pleasant vistas around every bend, often surprising the eye. This one does meet those standards. It’s less than 50 years old, but it was well-designed based on Sung Dynasty principles. The garden is in Jurong, an unimpressive blue-collar residential part of town, far from the city center, and unfortunately the drab mid-rise residential buildings mar some of the nicest vistas. Still, you do get a seven-story pagoda, quite nice lakeside pavilions, an ornate sign in calligraphy, and a statue of a fat and jolly Confucius. (Personally I’ve never pictured Confucius as either fat or jolly, but the Confucian Academy in Beijing itself has a modern statue of Master Kung with an ample pot-belly, so I’m officially out-voted).

If you’ve never seen a proper Chinese garden, I would be inclined to recommend this as an option once you’ve seen all your high-priority attractions (Zoo, Gardens, the top museums, Southern Ridges, and so on). If on the other hand you’ve been to Yu Yuan in Shanghai, or the UNESCO-rated gardens in Sozhou, you might want to take a pass on this one.

One other qualifier: I hiked here after spending the day on Bukit Timah, arrived late, and saw only the Chinese garden, not the adjacent Japanese one, having seen quite a few of them in Japan. Since they’re cheek by jowl on two adjacent islands, if you’ve never seen either a Chinese or a Japanese garden, coming her to see both of these might well be worthwhile. I’ll attach photos of the seven-story pagoda, the lakeside pavilions, the inscription in calligraphy, and that ho-ho-ho Confucius.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 05:49:10.063017

Other notable buildings include: the double pagoda, the stone boat, several moon gates & bridges, & the floating pavilion... There are also lots of statues such as Confucius and Mulan, several different themed gardens like the zodiac animal garden with a bench and a statue dedicated to each animal in the Chinese zodiac.
Japanese Garden, built by Japanese landscape architects at the invitation of the Singaporean government to promote harmony, is very subdued and understated. It is accessed over a beautiful slightly arched bridge from Chinese Garden. The emphasis is on stone lanterns and manicured shrubs in Japanese Garden. You can budget 25% of your time for Japanese Garden. Both gardens are great for photographers and plein air painters!
There is no queue or charge to visit the gardens.
There is no 'dress code', but Singaporeans don't visit gardens dressed in rags or skimpy outfits.

Walking by the edge of the lake I came across a Lace Monitor who casually climbed out of the lake just a meter or two in front of me. A few minutes later he was joined by his friend who strolled across the walkway from the other direction. Very cool!!

It's not as crowded as anywhere else in Singapore. There are a lot of nice views here which you can take photos or just enjoy the scenery and fresher air. Booking is not required. Entrance is free. It's located at the west part of Singapore close to IMM which is Singapore's Largest Outlet Mall. I would recommend that you visit the Chinese Garden in the morning say 7am when it's not too hot. Do bring water and some light snacks as there are not many shops at this place. After 9am or 10am, the few snack shops will start to open and you can grab drinks, light snacks and ice cream. Toilets are available. On weekends, you can see a few people doing Tai Chi exercise if you reach here about 7am - 8am. Once you are done, you can grab taxi at the main road and head down to IMM where you can have breakfast or brunch and continue shopping at this outlet mall.

The place was understandably packed to the brim and I never went back till today. This time I went at 8am on a Friday morning for a walk and found the tranquility and quiet I was looking for.

Parking at the Japanese Gardens was very limited, so I parked at the Chinese Gardens instead which was free. Admissions was FOC as well and they open at 5.30am. I guess you are allowed to feed the fishes and ride your bicycle here since I saw people doing that. Note to self: maybe next time I'll pack my bike and bring some bread.

I enjoyed admiring the beautifully maintained landscape. I was a little lost as there didn't seem to be any park map sign boards at different parts of the park to show the overall layout and where you are. There were signs to point you towards different areas though. Eventually I ended up at the bridge leading to Japanese Gardens. The landscape changed a bit to reflect the Japanese style which was very nice. There were less people here maybe because it's a further walk away.

It's a really nice park where you can get good quiet ""me"" time in the cool mornings. I definitely give it the thumbs up and will return.",07-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 05:49:46.842019

This place is a definite must see for nature lovers! I reckon 3 hours is sufficient for a relaxing and leisurely stroll around both the Chinese and Japanese Gardens. Start with a climb up the 7-storey pagoda for a stunning panoramic view of Singapore, then make your way to the lovely twin pagodas.

There is a gorgeous bonsai garden located within the Chinese Gardens, where you can sit on a stone seat and admire the beautiful scenery. The Chinese Gardens also has a live tortoise and turtle museum (that deserves more love), which houses rare species from across the world. There is plenty of squirrel and bird watching to be done as well around the gardens. In fact, I managed to spot a Kingfisher, which was awesome!

Once you have completed a full circuit of the Chinese Gardens, cross over the long white bridge into the Japanese Gardens to see picturesque red bridges over water lily filled ponds. I would love to visit here again in the future with a good book and a picnic basket.

The whole area - which is unlike less developed places such as MacRitchie Reservoir or Pulau Ubin Island - is beautifully built and maintained, while at the same time it doesn't feel commercial like Sentosa.

It is easily accessible via Chinese Garden MRT, or you can bike to and around the whole place. Walking throughout the park could take you anywhere between one to three hours depending on how much you want to cover the gardens, and how much time you want to spend on photography.

The park is extremely scenic, with countless photographic opportunities especially around the eveneing. The vastness of the park also allows it to be isolated from the hassle of the city as well as not to feel crowded. Must-see sights include the Twin Pagodas (near the Jurong Lake), the 7-story Pagoda, Bonsai Garden (do not miss!), and the Japanese Garden. The Japanese Garden specifically had that feeling of being away from all the city hustle, like I felt I was in a rather heavenly, peaceful, serene place.

This is a place to go, exercise, and/or relax especially if you live in the West area. Highly recommended.

Tips:
* Bonsai Garden is open until 5pm, while the 7-story Pagoda and the Japanese Garden are open until 7pm. The rest of the park operates until 11pm (officially, I'm not sure if people can still visit afterwards).
* Try climbing up the 7-story Pagoda before 7pm - sunset (e.g. ~6:50pm) to have a nice view of the sunsest behind the Jurong Lake.
* Bring water or drinks if you're exercising or staying longer. There are a few water fountains near toilets, but they were hardly usable the day I was there. Same goes with the snacks if you don't want to go to the MRT for convenience stores.
* If you don't mind some extra walking, you can either start at Jurong Lake MRT and finish at Chinese Garden MRT, or vice versa. The lake is a nice place to walk around especially in the evening and around sunset.
* You may get lucky and catch the sight of some tropical birds or even pelicans. They're easier to spot near the lakes or ponds.
* Apply sunscreen if you go during a sunny day. There are paths which are not covered and can get you eassily sun-burned. Same goes for raincoats and umbrellas on rainy days.",05-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 05:49:53.379807

Just walked straight,actually on the mrt u can see the 7th Storey Pagoda. Entering from mrt station is the East Entrance. If u want to cover Chinese n Japanese Garden,u can started from right hand side so that after completing Chinese garden can continued Japanese Garden. But for me,just covered Chinese Garden so i started on the left.

First of all, is the Garden of Abundance,there r twelve zodiac statues n the Sundial. And there r small benches w some of the 12 zodiac at both ends. Spotted a Mickey Mouse,dragon,roaster.Next is the Bonsai Garden but is open at 9am so I process to Tea House Pavilion,many big black colour fishes n there r ppl throwing bread (own bring)to feed them. Next to it is the Confucius Statue. Further up there r many stones craft w red bold words of describing of love. Beside it is the Live Turtle & Tortoise Museum,need admission fee.

Then I process to Stone Boat,is opposite the Tea House Pavilion. Walked further down is the West Entrance,where the Garden Courtyard n White Rainbow bridge are. Then process to Twin Pagoda,is just (3 storeys only) but staircase is narrow.

Then I went back to the Bonsai Garden,there r 2 Terracotta Army statues兵马俑 at the both side of door. There r many bonsai displays.

8 Heroes statue,Yue Fei,Hua Mu Lan,Admiral Cheng Ho,Confucius,etc...Then I climbed up the 7 Storey Pagoda-云塔(cloud pagoda)nice name,the staircase is board so is easy to climb but is high too if u non stop climbing up. Very good scenery for taking photos.

It took me 2hrs to explore the whole garden n finished up my 1.5litre of water as is a sunny day. Took 140+ of photos. There r kiosk(East Entrance,mrt station)selling drink, bottle mineral water, $1 n drinks never check. Like the whole experience,plus it is free admission.

Its a very nice place, lush green with very well designed gardens, replete with water bodies, lots of places to rest, public utilities and even a high rise pagoda. The way the Japanese garden is designed, I actually got an impression that i was waling in one of the gardens I have seen in Tokyo.

On the Chinese side, you have stone statues of Chinese legends which give it a very Chinese flavour, and one large statue of Confucius.

But i think the best part of the Garden is a live tortoise museum displaying live tortoise and turtles from various parts of the world.

OK,it's a park in a residential area, modeled with the archetypal medieval Chinese / Japanese town garden in mind. And a major overhaul is under way: in a few years' time there will be hotels, a more beautiful lake, and dining. Until that is done, however, this area is determinedly delivering little to any tourist. There's hardly anything to see or do on the large expanse of land but walk around aimlessly in the hear - unless you like turtles, or climbing up a long, vertigo-inducing flight of stone steps up the main pagoda to be welcomed by a view of apartment blocks across the lake. The Japanese gardens consist of a small collection of stone sculptures, bonsai plants and a little footbridge.

And it can even get a bit noisy if some groups of off-work foreign labourers (there are workers' dormitories in Jurong) decide to have an impromptu party of some sort.

If you want to experience a Chinese or Japanese garden, visit China. Or Japan.Just saying.

The gardens are connected to each other by the Bridge of Double Beauty. Both the gardens are popular with photographers and lately, cosplayers, who want to feature the unique architecture found within the gardens as part of their photoshoots.

The Chinese Garden has a good bonsai collection, and various pavilions and pagodas in the northern Chinese imperial style. Some of the Icons of the Chinese Garden include the seven storey Cloud Piercing Pagoda and the statues of famous heroes in Chinese history. Don’t miss the unusual Live Turtle and Tortoise Museum ($5/entry), containing about 180 turtles and more than 3,000 turtle-related items collected by the museum’s owner and his daughter.

The adjoining Japanese Garden is modelled on Japanese gardening aesthetics of the Muromachi and Momoyama period and features arched bridges, stone paths, rock waterfalls, stone lanterns and Japanese-styled pagodas.

The best times to visit the gardens are during Chinese New Year (usually January or February) and the Mid-Autumn Festival (September or October), when cultural performances are held and the gardens are lit up at night like a fairyland by hundreds of beautiful and ornate paper lanterns. Otherwise, pop by for a quiet stroll or jog, a spot of photography or just to enjoy the scenery.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:51:10.017934
