We walked by a shady forest with many seeds on the ground. We passed by the Mount Faber Cable car station and ticketing office, and continued walking toward Telok Blangah Hill. Henderson Wave was amazing! It curved around tree tops and soared above roads. We continued up steel treetop bridges, and crossed over to the Hort Park. From there we proceeded to Kent Ridge Park, and enjoyed walking through the forest. Highly recommended for the views - a good way to appreciate nature.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:20:57.152618
,1,27,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Bluesphynx,666577244,15-04-2019,5,Wonderful views,"An exhilarating walk from Vivocity mrt to Hort Park! You need to climb some rather steep stairs to get on the trail to Mt Faber Park but that's only about 10 minutes uphill for a reasonably fit person and you can always stop to catch your breath, there are railings to cling on to if you're elderly. Enjoy the leaf-litter communities at both sides as you go up. You're rewarded with a wonderful view of Sentosa and the cable cars once you reach the top of the stairs with the boat-like structure. A kind of Singapore hanam is visible on the treetops but I stead of cherry blossom you have local flowers. The vegetation is lush with colorful flowers, even bamboo and angsana in their pods as you walk on the sturdy steel path at the same height as the treetops. Looking down into the valley as you exit Henderson, you see banana trees and plenty of foliage. Colourful boards provide useful botanical information and pictures of birds you can spot if you're lucky. We saw one monkey, boldly resting against the rail and scratching his vitals but it was well-behaved and didn't attempt to snatch anything but we kept our distance, obeying the warnings posted everywhere.
A wonderful two hours well-spent. We appreciated the clean public toilet halfway but refilled our water bottles only when we got to Hort Park where there's a water fountain.
From Hort Park we took a bus, 61 if I recall correctly to Queensway and then to the Food Village, a large hawker centre where we dug into the prawn and pork rib noodles! IKEA is nearby so you may want to drop by for their soya ice-cream and coffee, both at 50 cents!",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:20:57.506326

Recommend to start at Kent Ridge Park, in particular, to take the Canopy Walk first. That was what got the 9yo excited and eager to continue. At the end of the Canopy Walk, you can start the trek through Kent Ridge Park into HortPark where there are pockets of gardens and nursery plots to slow down, take photos, etc. Do check out the scarecrow — Southeast Asian style.

Proceed thereafter to the Forest Walk, through Alexandra Arc, which is another elevated bridge walk. Lovely to see a different side of Singapore. Also great to see varying sizes and stages of reforestation plots. It was just amazing to see the efforts placed into creating all this greenery.

Another highlight of the walk is the Henderson Waves. Kids had a lot of fun there.

You can then proceed to Faber Peak or, like us, we descended and left the walk for a late lunch at HarbourFront Vivocity.

Definitely a walk worth taking.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:21:05.911014

The nicest part is the raised platform around the Southern Ridges and of course the Henderson Waves. It is fairly up and down. It is not all in the middle of the forest - don't expect it to be all like the Henderson Waves with views on Singapore - but it is very pleasant. There are some toilets at Hort Park.

We get a cab to drop us on Preston Road (just look for the Forest Walk steel walkway). We walk in the direction of Faber Peak which takes us from Forest Walk to Henderson Waves then on to Faber Peak (where the cable car can take you to harbourfront and onto Sentosa).

The walk is 2kms and takes an hour with kids 5-8 years old including stops. Much of it is shaded. You’re slowly climbing most of the walk. We first stop for a short break at the outdoor gym area where there are toilets and a water fountain. We then stop for morning tea on the Henderson Waves and will spend up to 20 minutes looking at the view and relaxing on the covered seating.

When to walk: it’s Singapore and it’s hot, so the earlier the better. The cable car opens at 8:45am and Palawan Pirate ship at 10am. We time our walk and breaks with those things in mind.

Tips: If you’ve got kids with easily tired legs and it’s dry, then it’s possible to take a scooter. The steel track of forest walk worked okay for the micro style scooter. I can’t recall ever seeing a push chair, but the route we take is pushchair friendly.

We started off near Science Park Drive and were immediately immersed into the woods, whilst the busy AYE expressway was not far behind us!

It’s not too onerous. We did exit from HarbourFront MRT to Mount Faber (exit D if memory serves) then straight out onto walk. A 10 min walk up steps is rewarded by excellent view.

Continue well signposted route. We stopped off at cable car on Mount Faber for an ice cream before continuing to top then heading to Henderson waves then followed path to forest walk.

Otherwise, doing it the other way round, you can spend the rest of your day at Sentosa if you still have the energy.

As you can see from the rating and all the reviews, this is a must do activity! Back in 2002, the city proposed to connect a series of parks which is now the Southern Ridges. The approximate 6-mile walk is mostly incline and decline pathways built for the average person. You will walk over beautiful foliage and will have some of the best skyline and water views. During your walk, you’ll pass by the Singapore cable car station. If you’re planning to use the Grab app to get you there and you type in “Southern Ridges”, the GPS of the app will take the driver to a section off of Alexandra Road. Don’t do this! It’s very dangerous to get out of the car on this busy roadway. It has barriers you’ll need to jump over in order to get to the trail. I highly recommend starting at the Harbourfront MRT station.

,1,27,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,648439232,27-01-2019,5,A Memorable Encounter,"I’m a great fan of the Southern Ridges, so of course I took my Thai partner Ratchanok up to catch the grand views. She had a memorable encounter there; all three of us can laugh about it now (assuming cobras are able to laugh), but none of us was laughing then. I’ll give a brief overview of the Southern Ridges first, then tell you what happened, and end this review with some basic safety tips in case you have a similar encounter, either there or elsewhere. I’ll state up front, however, that I rate the Southern Ridges 5 stars and definitely do recommend that you walk the Ridges.

The Southern Ridges are a line of hill-tops running between the Ayer Rajah Expressway to the north, and the West Coast Highway to the south. They provide a grand walk notable for splendid views of (a) the Singapore Strait, offshore islands and (on clear days) Sumatra; and (b) jungle (see Jungle to Strait and Jungle Skyline photos). If I have an entire day to kill, I like to start my walk at the western-most point, Bukit Chandu. From its museum, you wind down to Canterbury Road and go through the horticultural park (HortPark) to the Southern Ridges trail proper, which is at the intersection of Hyderabad and Alexandra Roads (the latter named in honor of the Danish princess who had the grave misfortune of marrying the Prince of Wales; getting a street named after her in Singapore was small recompense). From the Alexandra Arch, you continue eastward, going to the top of Telog Blangah Hill, then down and across the Henderson Waves to Mount Faber. From Mount Faber Station you can either take the gondola down to Sentosa Island or walk downhill to the Coast Road via a stairway on the south slope of Mount Faber (see Southern Stairway photo).

On this occasion, pressed for time, we took a taxi to Alexandra Road, and started our walk from the Arch. The Southern Ridges is a much easier walk than at Bukit Timah, and allows you to escape the forest floor to better vantage points above. Of course, “easier” is a relative term in Singapore’s heat and humidity; take a water bottle with you, and good walking shoes. You may discover a water fountain or two where you can slake your thirst and refill your bottle (see Water at Last photo), but there aren’t many of them.

You can take the “low road” walking along the jungle floor, or the “high road”, walking on elevated pedestrian bridges where you’ve a better chance of seeing the tropical birds making those jungle calls, and getting vistas of the city and the strait (see The High Road photo). At a few places, you actually do get quite close to “canopy level” but since this is all secondary forest, the canopy is nowhere near the height it attains in Sarawak or Sumatra (see Canopy Level photo; the only primary forest left in town is at Bukit Timah, and even that is a far cry from climax Malayan jungle). As the ground level rises and gets closer to you, you can look down at the jungle floor or across at stands of bamboo (see Jungle Floor and Bamboo photos). At the tops of Telog Blangah and Mount Faber, even on terra firma, you’re at some of the highest elevations in Singapore. There’s a splendid piazza on top of Telog Blangah, with an elegant stairwell taking you back down (see TB Piazza and TB Stairway photos). Henderson Waves is a treat in itself, provided you’ve got dozens of people crossing it (I’ve reviewed that separately).

Other than birds, however, you’re unlikely to spot any jungle animals. This could be considered a blessing. On Bukit Timah, the macaques can be aggressive pests (thanks in large part to humans who ignore placards not to feed them), and though I enjoy watching the monkeys, perhaps it’s just as well that the Southern Ridges have no macaques. Early in Singapore history, man-eating tigers were even more aggressive pests, coming down from the bukits at night: in the worst year, Singapore man-eaters took almost a human a night. Organized tiger-hunting eliminated that menace, forever. So, don’t expect to see monkeys, tigers, rogue elephants or salt-water crocs on the Southern Ridges. On the other hand, I can now say with 100% certainty that the Ridges do have at least one cobra.

Having crossed over the Henderson Waves, we were walking at ground level on Mount Faber. Ratchanok was a few meters in front of me. Nok is a country girl from Isaan (despite speaking four languages), with a great deal of jungle smarts, and she is extraordinarily observant, usually, most of the time. Yet suddenly I heard a blood-curdling scream and saw Nok doing a standing broad jump back towards me, a jump of Olympian proportions. If Thailand’s Olympics track and field coach had been up there with us, he’d have signed Nok up on the spot despite her age. Astonished, I momentarily saw a dark snake rapidly disappearing off the walking path and into the brush, as fast as its legs could go, so to speak. If snakes had Serpentine Olympics and Singapore’s Serp Olympics track and field coach had been there, he’d have signed up Johnny Cobra on the spot too.

Nok told me it was a nuhow-kii. She had been looking up and around as she walked, and didn’t see the nuhow-kii until she was about to step down on it. She didn’t know the English name of the snake, but knew that it was a “VERY bad” one. She emphasized that it was black all over, which is how you can tell that it’s a nuhow-kii. Later I showed her photos of several dangerous snakes that you might encounter in Singapore, and she immediately identified the nuhow-kii as a Malayan spitting cobra.

That made sense: unlike nocturnal king cobras, spitting cobras are diurnal, and are far more common in Singapore. When they feel threatened, spitting cobras might bite whatever is frightening them, injecting the venom; but instinctively they spit the venom at their threat’s eyes, and their aim is quite accurate. The venom causes intense pain and inflammation, and people instinctively frantically rub their eyes: a very, very bad idea. If you rub or scratch your eyes, the venom will cause worse damage. Instead, the eyes should be repeatedly and immediately washed out. If you’re promptly taken to Alexandra Hospital, just up the road from Alexandra Arch, odds are good that with copious irrigation, lubricants and topical antibiotics, you’ll have a substantial recovery within two days or so. (Yes, the hospital, at AYE and Alexandra, is named at least indirectly for the Danish Princess of Wales, and yes, it was the scene of the infamous massacre of patients and staff by the Japanese after their capture of Singapore; it’s now one of the best hospitals in SE Asia; they do treat patients who were hit in the eyes by spitting cobras, but such cases occur very, very rarely).

I distinctly remember seeing large snake warning signs at Bukit Timah; I don’t recall ever seeing any at Southern Ridges, but perhaps I just missed them. At Bukit Timah, the recommendation was that if you see a dangerous snake, you should immediately take four giant steps backward . If you’ve ever climbed up the steep main path at Bukit Timah, it’s obvious why trying to rapidly take four giant steps backward releases you from any snake dangers: you’d break your fool neck long before the snake could reach you. The placards also assure you that the snake will be more afraid of you, than you are of it. The spitting cobra Nok almost stepped on certainly felt threatened, and lost no time getting away, but I can’t imagine it was more terrified of Nok, than she was of it.

One other observation: I did not ask Nok at the time and I haven’t bothered to ask her since, but if you think about what the official placards at Bukit Timah said to do, and what she did, what she did made more sense. Instead of four giant steps backward, or even one; she immediately spun around and then jumped for her life, with her eyes facing away from the spitting cobra. Four giant steps backwards would keep your eyes open facing toward it, and your eyes are its target of choice. Hmmm. In any event, while snake incidents do occur in Singapore, foreign tourists are unlikely to be gardening, clearing brush, pulling out old drain pipes, deliberately trying to catch a snake, or doing other things that would increase their risk. If you’re walking down Bras Basah, shopping on Orchard Road, night-marketing in Chinatown, or even walking the Southern Ridges, your odds of being involved in a snake incident are very close to nil.

As for Ratchanok and me, we got up to the Mount Faber Station without further incident. Near the station, Nok discovered a Bell of Happiness. In Thailand, folks mainly ring bells in Buddhist temples, to bring good fortune or to avert evil. Nok had already had a giant dose of good fortune bestowed and evil averted, but she made an immediate bee-line to that Bell of Happiness and gave it a good dozen celebratory rings (see Bell of Happiness photo)! Somewhere back by Henderson Waves, if there was a serpentine version of such a bell, a Rattle of Happiness or something, our recent acquaintance the spitting cobra was probably ringing that one just as merrily, and thinking “blimey, that was a close call!”",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 05:23:18.640360

We did from Kent Bridge to The Henderson Wave bridge, which was around 2.4km. You can do smaller sections or walk further if you wish.
So Kent Bridge is where we started. We walked in from the university where we had lunch. The canopy walk was great and there was a view of the harbour area. Next is the hort. park, where you can view some great ideas for a home garden. The forest walk was very hot but we were glad we were walking on the elevated walkway and not the ground walk. Can I say the time we visited, Singapore was in a bit of a dry spell. In wetter times this would be a little more pleasant I feel.
Just before we did Henderson wave it did rain but we were able to take shelter in the park just before the bridge. We ended our walk just after the bridge as we had been on the Mt. Fabre cable car before. You can continue on past the cable car.
To get to the start we took the MRT to the university and then a bus back into central Singapore from Henderson wave. The park brochure says to start from Henderson Wave but this means you would have a hill climb at the end to get up to the Canopy walk.",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 05:23:19.340892

Yes, as the other reviews have said there are steps here, but they are graduated and with a reasonable level of fitness you will be ok. Your alternative would be to catch the cable car to the top of mt Faber and walk from there.

I don't think i could have worked out where to find the start from the other end at Kent ridge. Anyway when you walk from Harbourfront the canopy walk is downhill.

There are lots of signs to help you find your way. You won't get lost.

Mt faber-great views over the city and sentosa.
Henderson waves bridge- a wonderful feat of architecture.
Hort park- very pretty, and has a playground for children
Canopy walk and forest walk- there are elevated tree top walkways with great views of the gardens and city.
We finished at Kent ridge park. As we were taking transport we walked through past the pond then out to the road, we caught the bus to Kent ridge mrt. The whole thing took us a few hours with lots of rests. Most of it is very shady. Plenty of toilets and vending machines to buy drinks (need small dollar notes or coins).

The path starts immediately outside one of the MRT exits at Harbourfront MRT station.
The path climbs up to Mount Faber using a series of steps. Once you have reached the top you walk past the cable station and onto ""Henderson Waves"" which is a long footbridge in a wave design that crosses a motor way. Then you continue onto a long section of steel walkways above the bush canopy. Once we reached Alexandra Road, we left the path and walked downhill along Alexandra Road for approx 900 meters to the Alexandra Park MRT station.
The entire walk should take about 90 minutes but can be done quicker or longer depending on how often you stop to rest. A lot of the journey is shaded. I suggest you carry water for the walk.

There is not so much uphill walking after Faber Peak and there are view points and seats here and there along the way for you to have a rest if you need to. This trail is well worth doing - it has been well thought out, and built to a high standard and there is plenty to see all along the route - we really liked the design of The Henderson Waves Bridge - and it isn't busy so is quiet and peaceful. We walked the full route from Harbour Front/Mount Faber Park to the end at Kent Ridge Park stopping for a late lunch at Hort Park. Take a hat and a bottle of water.

,1,27,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/DadaGee,562059714,22-02-2018,5,Escape the madness,"A great way to escape the madness of Singapore City. The Southern Ridges are a series of interconnected walks along a ridge west of Singapore City, looking out over the straits.

The walk starts at HarbourFront MRT, where you can either walk up the Marang Trail into Mount Faber park - you can also get a cable car from Sentosa. Great views of the city and the straits. You can get something to eat and drink at the Jewel Box. From Mount Faber, walking west, you gently climb up to Henderson Waves, and then into Telok Blangah Park, which has a collection of large trees set around private residences.

Then onto the Forest Walk, which is 1.3km of raised metal walkway, taking you through the treetops. There’s warnings of monkeys and snakes, but we never saw any. This section is really spectacular, and definitely recommended. Going west it gently slopes down; it might be hard work going east.

After Alexandra Arch, the trail goes into the more formal HortPark, which you could spend up to a couple of hours in if you’re interested in plants. Finally, there’s another elevated section - Canopy Walk - and then you can walk down to Science Park Drive and get the bus to Kent Ridge MRT. We missed out this bit, taking a bus back from Alexandra Road. (Google Maps is good for bus times and planning). Buses are good as you get to see various parts of the city you wouldn’t normally visit.

This was really enjoyable, and a contrast to the rest of Singapore, but we weren’t prepared for walking in the hot, humid atmosphere. The whole Southern Ridges walk is only 10km, which shouldn’t have been a problem for us, but we ran out of time (and water!). It takes far longer than in cooler climes - so do allow plenty of time, and take plenty of water.

Absolutely recommended - but be prepared!",10-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 05:23:54.514403

Pros:
1) Nice Relaxing getaway from city & urban Singapore
2) Nice walkways to view above trees
3) Nice layout of walkway specially designed for people to walk around
4) Forest walk is above trees nice designed

Cons:
1) NO proper signage from bus-stop & street level to point visitors to where is the opening for Henderson wave - u cannot expect first time visitors to hunt for it. Though the bridge can be seen from the street U will be scratching your head where is the entrance which is in Telok Blagah Hill
2) Henderson Wave is a bit short & views blocked by tress - LOL
3) Though there are signs to point to Kent Ridge it was not design properly
4) Don't go at night - the place is EXTREMELY dark cannot see the trees & forest below
5) Many of the vantage points are covered by tall trees so you cannot look out to good views
6) misleading signs
7) no water fountains - please bring your own bottles.
8) We got lost in Hort Park (entrance) because there won't any PROPER signs pointing to Kent Ridge
10) Not much place to sit
11) The top of Telok Blangah hill is closed for reno so u cannot go up to have nice views - waste time

Views change and points of interest are signposted well. Toilets and water points are marked on the maps and are clean and accessible. CONSIDER - your fitness, particularly in the heat/humidity. I live in a tropical climate, yet I still found it very hot as we climbed the stairs and I didn't take much of a rest at the top. TAKE WITH YOU water or even a Powerade/Gatorade.

,1,27,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/RowanH336,484888972,17-05-2017,4,Not a ' must do' despite the rating,"My partner and I tackled the Southern Ridges Walk on a recent trip to Singapore. Inspired by overeating and FOMO we decided to walk the entire track, starting at Harbourfront and finishing at the Kent Ridge station. You see the 'Southern Ridges' is a 9 kilometre path that connects the parks that exist on the Southern Ridge of Singapore. These are (From east to west) Mount Faber > Telok Blangah Hill Park > Kent Ridge park. The 9km track is broken up into 8 'trails' of various length which include (From east to west) Marang Trail > Faber Trail > Henderson waves > Hilltop Walk > Forest Walk > Alexandra Arch > Flora Walk & HortPark > Canopy Walk.

There were good and bad elements to this walk and here are a a few of my key thoughts and tips.

(1) To get here get on the MRT to the Harbourfront station. Once in the station depart it at 'exit D'. To your left you will see the start of the Marang trail. If you elect to do the entire thing you will pop out on the road near Kent Ridges station. You will need to get the bus (I think it was bus 91) which will take you to the Kent Ridge MRT station and from there you can make your way back.

(2) This is free

(3) There is really no need to complete the entire Southern Ridges walk and if I could have my time again I would only bother going from the Harbourfront station to the Alexandra Arch (Ie exiting at the start of the Kent Ridge Park) . The real highlights of this trek are the views from the top of mount faber, the henderson waves and the forest walk. None of the attractions to the west of the alexandra arch (Ie in Kent Ridge Park) are noteworthy and it becomes a bit harder to follow the trail with little signposting or direction. The majority of the trail is along a bitumen road and so you can comfortably exit at the alexandra arch without FOMO at this point in my opinion.

(4) Singapores heat is quite unrelenting. Don't underestimate it. Bring plenty of water, sunscreen and I would recommend tackling this in the late afternoon rather than the heat of the day.

(5) Unfortunately despite some greenery and the best efforts in terms of promotion there is nothing overly amazing in terms of views or nature. The entire time on the walk we could hear constant noise of construction and/or traffic.

Overall this was a ok but not amazing attraction in singapore. I think if you are first visiting singapore it is not a 'must do'. It's high position on tripadvisor is as much a reflection of the fact it is free rather than unmissable.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 05:24:22.746397

Walked through the various stages until we reached Pasir Panjang. For those that need a break during the walk be advised that there are plenty of toilets, areas to rest up and take in the ambience of the Southern Ridges. Toilets are clean. The first part of the walk is largely uphill but from the top of Faber Peak it is a long progressive downhill or lesser incline. We stopped off at the Hortpark which is certainly worth visiting. We also took the opportunity to visit the World War 2 interpretative centre which is located at Bukit Chandu which is the old ""opium hill"". See our separate review of this amazing centre.

The walks are all well marked and easy to follow. You can break from the walk at many points if you get tired. Start at the National University of Singapore and wend your way to the top of Kent Ridge Park. The path rises to a lovely panorama looking south over the coast. Take the elevated Canopy Walk (~16m) to the top of Pepys Road. Cross the road and visit Reflections at Bukit Chandu a World War II museum. Small but interesting and housed in an old colonial Black & White house. You are on the former Opium Hill where the old opium factory buildings still sit at the bottom of Pepys Rd. Take the path down to Hort Park where there are lots of birds, flowers and displays. (A diversion here to see the Black and White houses in Alexandra Park is worth the effort.) The path leads to Alexandra Arch and the start of the elevated walkway ( ~18m). The walkway brushes the tops of trees and takes you through Telok Blangah Hill Park and down to Henderson Waves which is a bridge to Mount Faber Park. This wave-like construction has breathtaking views from an elevation of about ~36m. Its eerie. The cable car station awaits your climb to the top of Mount Faber. From there you can take the cable car down and to Sentosa Island. If not, take the path down to the bottom where Vivo City Mall offers a myriad of food choices for lunch. About 12 to 15km depending on what you do. Take lots of water.",06-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 05:25:06.539405

Planned a last minute trekking to The Southern Ridges of Singapore, knowing the majority of the places would be crowded.

A morning work out with the nature was taxing at first as not much training was done before that. But having someone who know abit more on the direction plays a major part too. Spent the first half of the day trekking from Henderson Waves, through Forest and Canopy Walk and to Hortpark, last stop at Kent Ridge Park. It was quite a tough one as I grew blister on my toes along the way.

Exited at Kent Ridge Park and walked to the bus stop nearby. Unknowing we sat there for almost 10 minutes and realised that there will not be any bus service on Sundays and Public Holidays. So we walked for about 15 minutes more and finally we saw Kent Ridge MRT Station.

Trekers to note:
Do bring enough water as there is limited water cooler stops for you to refill your water
Wearing a good pair of shoes is a MUST
Do not carry heavy

A good burn out I had!

In fact, we were no walkers at all - but Southern Ridges will change things. Wether you live in Singapore, or are here for just a couple of days - and looking to move your legs after a week in the office or a long flight - this is the thing to do. You are up for 3h among wild green, plus some breathtaking views. A good place to start is Hort Park or the smart little parking at Hyderabad Road (5 mins walk to Alexandra Arch) - this is an alternative route to the one beginning at Harbourfront. From there, you go straight into the Singing Forest/ Forest Walk - you will go uphill in this direction, and it can be a challenge (especially on a hot day, as the next bench to sit on is on the top of the hill). Still, the climb is gradual and stair-free, and probably less demanding than the Marang Trail start. If you decide to continue to Henderson Waves (worth every step), and then to Faber Peak, the last bit will be steeper. However, you can relax and reward yourself for the effort in one of the Peak's bars, or take the cable over to Sentosa, or just take a ride home/ hotel, and jump into the pool.

But we set out on a dry afternoon after a visit to Reflections at Bukit Chendu (a wonderful and atmospheric attraction). The Southern Ridges walk can be joined right across the street by walking down the path into the park or by walking on the elevated walkway into Kent Ridge Park, which is not that much further along the path. Since Kent Ridge is essentially towards the end of the walk, we took the path down into the park. On a weekday, at least, it's a fairly quiet and pleasant walk where you can admire plant life and plenty of butterflies. The walk then extends into the very pleasant Hort Park, which has many theme gardens and is really just a really wonderful place to walk. This leads you towards Alexandra Road, where the path turns elevated again, and leads you through some lovely forest. The signs warn of not touching wild monkeys, but unfortunately, we didn't see any! They probably stayed tucked into the cool trees. One added bonus of this part of the walk is that you walk by a very lovely area of old black and white houses leftover from British days. Loved it!

We also took a short detour to see the Alkaff Mansion. This beautiful hilltop mansion used to be a wealthy family's home, but now it is a well-rated restaurant. A little further along from the mansion is the Henderson Waves Bridge which takes you over to the Mt. Faber area. We headed towards the ""Jewel Box"" hoping we could take the cable car over to the Harborfront Mall, but they don't allow that. You have to buy a full round-trip ticket over to Sentosa and back, so we walked a little further past the Jewel Box and headed down the hill through yet more forest. The mall was just across the street once we made it down the hill (it is quite a few steps!). We had a wonderful kaya toast and coffee at Wang Cafe in the mall, and congratulated ourselves on a really fun afternoon. Fun to see another side of Singapore. I highly recommend it.

This walk/hike is stunning in its scenery, wholly varied at each point, and undulating. It can cater to those out for a lazy stroll, family outing, or fitness fanatics. Plenty of rest stops available and shelter from the elements. If you wish, stop for a spot of meditation. Trails are well spread out so one doesn't feel crowded out.

I recommend starting from Telok Blangah Hill Park, across the Henderson Waves, onwards to Mount Faber, and then back. A very comfortable 45-60min brisk walk ... IF you don't get distracted with photo-taking or a drinks at Faber Point!",12-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 05:26:09.480175

One issue with this route was poor signage in some key decision points when on several occasions I arrived at a fork in the path or road and there was no signs advising to choose left or right to remain on the actual Southern Ridge trail. Luckily, I had offline Google maps on my smart phone and that had enough detailed mapping of trails to keep me on track.

The other thing to note is the signage itself only mentioned the name of upcoming attraction on the trail, so you'd need to know the order in your head if heading east to west which were Mount Faber -> Henderson Waves -> Telok Blangah Hill Park -> Alexandra Arch -> Hort Park -> Kent Ridge Park.

The entire trail surface was paved with either tarmac, cement, and grated aluminium in the raised walkway at Telok Blangah which was wet and quite slippery for running with my road joggers. There were excellent male/female public toilets and water taps at Mount Faber park and Hort Park. You could feasibly just do a one-way trip east to west as Kent Ridge MRT station is just 1km west of Kent Ridge pond at the western end of the Southern Ridges.

Overall, the scenery was very nice with elevated views to the water, and this is one of the very few places in Singapore to do a longish run without having to content with vehicle traffic.",12-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 05:26:15.769767

Leave the station through exit D, turn right and marang road is right there. I'm pretty fit but found the run tough. Most of the run is actually steps which are slippy in running shoes and the combination of exertion and heat are pretty harsh. Although I enjoyed the run I do have a gripe, the signage is ambiguous and very easy to miss if you are travelling at speed. You also won't see a sign saying southern ridges; you have to know the order of the landmarks and the last bit is just signed 'pond. I also got pretty annoyed around hort park. My advice to runners is; if you are in town do it, treat it as an interval session, take plenty of water and prepare for the labyrinth of paths.

Totally enjoy the walk and by some piece of luck have never been caught in the rain. I have never seen large crowds on this path, maybe I am just lucky!! I would certainly recommend if interested in the scenic and natural views.

Last few visits have been started by coming in by bus and dismounting at Harbour Front. Walk across the car park (right hand side), note where motorbikes are parked and go there as that leads you onto the climb up through the narrow gateway. The path climbs up, and then you get to the cable car point with some nice views. At the end of the road you can bear right and head straight to Henderson Waves or bear left and go up to the actual summit of Mount Faber. Invariably there will be some coach tours out there, behind the top there are steps down (not too easy to find) which get you down to a road and then you right turn up for the way to Henderson Waves. This is just a great piece of architecture to see, and just a steady gentle climb. Beyond the Waves you eventually come to the canopy walk over Teloch Blangah Hilltop Park for 1.3Km with some lovely views of trees and shrubs (can always go to the bottom and walk along the floor), again great. Before doing this you can note a climb up to Terrace Gardens for yet another panoramic view. Some steep step climbing. After the canopy walk it is then Alexandra Arch over the road and onto Hort Park. This park is very different to the previous ones, and worth the contrast. Very well maintained. At the far end of the park, the path winds up to the Kent ridge on another shorter treetop walk, where there are some reflective posters from WW2, and more views. There is also a nearby museum.

The option can then be to walk back and get a bus or taxi or follow the signs for the Kent Ridge Pond. There you will see a map showing directions to Kent Ridge MRT (less than 20 mins to get there).

The straight walk from Harbour Front to Kent Ridge is about 90 mins, but enjoying the scenary obviously adds more time.

I have seen monkeys on the canopy walk in the past, but not for a while.

Not all parts are well sign posted, the easiest option is probably to start from Alexandra Arch and return to Harbour Front. This is also the most attractive part of the whole walk.",12-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 05:26:26.362751

Mostly well-signed, there were two or three points where it was a little disjointed for those who don't know the area well. That, however, was a very minor issue and there are static maps posted along the way. Just take a paper version with you to connect the dots.

The start from Harbourfront is not well-indicated but easy enough if you follow this route...I took the MRT to Harbourfront and turned away from the shopping mall after exiting the ticket gates but while still underground (it is signed for the bus terminus and hawker centre). This route takes you through an underpass to avoid crossing the busy road. I then walked through the open-air car park towards the hill and the far right corner, where there is a narrow gateway and a footpath to the left. The path climbs up, in a ten-minute sweaty walk, to Mount Faber. I then followed the signs to Henderson Waves, which is a spectacularly high walkway over a busy road. The walk takes you then to Hort Park, via a long and impressive treetop walkway. In the past, I have met monkeys on this walkway, though none were evident yesterday. The views of the varied trees and shrubs is lovely, even without wildlife. Hort Park (the name is short for Horticultural) has toilets and drinks/snacks machines and a visitor centre. It is an impressive example of horticultural skills, in contrast to the forested parts of this walk. At the far end of the park, the path winds up again to the ridge on another shorter treetop walk, at the top of which is a small, but sobering and impressive, museum and memorial to the lives lost in Singapore during the Japanese Invasion.

The walk continues for a while along Kent Ridge at the end of which you can descend to a road with bus service (but not on Sundays!). Turn left and walk for ten-fifteen minutes to find Kent Ridge MRT to take you back to Harbourfront or, on a circular route with interchanges, towards Doby Ghaut MRT Station.

Along the way, there are toilet facilities and storm shelters. Since a thunderstorm was approaching, I noted the locations of the shelters, in case I had to turn back. You do not want to be caught in the open in a tropical thunderstorm! I did not check the time, but I think it took about 2.5 hours and was probably 10 kms long.

Get yourself to the Alexandra and Depot roads crossing (the bus stops on the Depot Rd. near the Interlace* building, see below).

Right at the start of the pathway, the Alexandra Arch is a good spot to enjoy the labyrinth view of the Interlace building, esp. before and after sunset…

The metal elevated path is built high over the surrounding 'jungle', you have nice views of the forest, harbor and nearby public housing buildings... The walkway connects with the Telok Blangah Hill Park, the Henderson Waves and the Mount Faber park. You can combine them all for a nice leisurely walk. The Southern Ridges path is mostly uphill but once you reach its end and cross into the Terrace Garden in the in the Telok Balangan Hill park it's all downhill from there, all the way to the VivoCity Mall and transportation back to the downtown are and hotels.

Quite enjoyable, have some water with you and a towel to wipe off sweat;) Again, the best time to visit is late afternoon before sunset, when it starts cooling off a little, not much though... It's Singapore after all, hot and humid year round.

* A residential building that you can walk or view from the Southern Ridges walkway. It looks better from further away, at least in pictures, as a jumble of haphazardly laid out apartment blocks, unique, creative, and I'm sure functional.

It was absolutely beautiful. I started from
The Alexandra Bridge and walked to Mt Faber. I particularly enjoyed the forest walk, which is an elevated metal walk way through at the canopy level through the forest. I went early on in the morning (around 9 am) to beat the heat and I think this is the best way to do it. It was not crowded at all, I only encountered a few joggers and a couple of tourists by the Mt Faber area. Which was quite a relief as many places in Singapore are packed with tourists (understandably, it's a beautiful city.) It's a great way to get a little away from the busy city and enjoy the beautiful natural flora that Singapore has to offer.

At the end there is the Seah Im food center which is a hawker center with lots of tasty food for dirt cheap. There's a metro station right there or you can get a taxi or Uber as well, they are all over the place. Overall, it was a wonderful way to spend a morning and I would recommend it to anyone who likes nature and is traveling to Singapore.",05-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 05:26:43.239274

It's an OK attraction but if it's your first visit to Singapore, I wouldn't prioritise it.

Longer review: This walk has been on my long list for a while, after reading a very enthusiastic report about it in a travel guide (maybe Lonely Planet?). I tried to do it on my last trip to Singapore with my parents, but after visiting Haw Par Villa I started to feel ill and retreated to our hostel; my parents then went the wrong way and ended up wandering round the university campus, so I didn't even get to find out how it was from them!

Anyway, I thought my parents just had no sense of direction, and this time I decided to start at Kent Ridge MRT, confident that I could find the way. Ha! I'm so used to Singapore being super easy that I was completely thrown by the total lack of signposts outside the station. There was a map showing the park but nothing to indicate the best way into it. I ended up walking up Science Park Drive - it bends to the left, there's a turnoff to the right, then the next on the right should be a concrete path taking you into the park. Here there's a sign for the park but nothing about the ""southern ridges walk"", so you have to wander around (or in my case, use the Google Maps app on my phone without internet access) to figure out where to go.

Signposts and place names painted on the ground give inconsistent directions to the 'Memories at Bukit Chandu' museum and the canopy walk. I ended up doing the canopy walk and arriving at the museum, even though my guidebook (2016 Rough Guide this time - I didn't like it much) implied the walk came after the museum. I was hot and not in the best of moods by this time, but the museum is worth a visit if you're doing this part of the walk - even just for the A/C, toilets and vending machine with cold drinks! Seriously - it's very well done but very small; better to visit the museum in Changi or the Battlebox to learn about WWII Singapore.

Directions on leaving the museum were also useless; I think I should have turned left and gone down the steps on the right before the gated area that I think was housing, but I ended up redoing the canopy walk before finally making it to Hort Park. The guidebook recommended taking Hyderabad Road round the north of the park to see the ""tropical Tudor"" housing as the park itself was rather boring, and I should have followed their advice. Although there were many different sections to the park, I was too hot to enjoy any of them and it seemed more like a place locals would go for specific events.

I then got to Alexandra Arch; the path is a lot clearer from this point and I'd recommend you start here, unless you want to visit the fabulously freaky Haw Par Villa or Bukit Chandu first. You needn't worry about the canopy walk as east of the arch it's also an elevated walkway offering the same kind of view.

I detoured down to Gillman Barracks not long after the arch, which has been converted into a series of art galleries. Nothing really grabbed me but if you like contemporary art it's worth dropping in. Rejoining the main trail it was a straightforward walk to Harbourfront MRT, the highlights being the Henderson Waves Bridge and views from Mount Faber Park. Although my guidebook recommended doing the walk west to east to avoid the steep uphill hike from Harbourfront MRT to Faber Park, that part is very short; I think the best reason to do it this way round is to finish back in ""town"" with glorious air-conditioning and restaurants in VivoCity mall!

So overall, aside from the frustrating lack of signage at the beginning this is quite a nice walk. However, I got tired of walking on concrete and tarmac the whole way, and the views just weren't as interesting as I was expecting. So far I have been underwhelmed by both this and Pulau Ubin but highly enjoyed the Botanic Gardens, so maybe Singapore just isn't very good at truly ""natural"" nature.

It is 8-9km in total I believe.
The walk from the MRT to the start of the trail is long and arduous, it took me about 25 minutes to find/navigate/walk.
I started this walk at about 11.30am (having left my condo at 10am!!), and so walked through the midday heat, which I wouldn't recommend as it's in the sun and sweaty enough as it is.
I found solace and rest in the community gardens at the end of the Kent Ridge Park section, which has lots of wonderful mini gardens you can explore, plus a restaurant, water fountain (needed!!), and public loos to put most others to shame!
The rest of the walk was delightful, I didn't see any monkeys on the canopy walk but it was delightful all the same. The Henderson waves really are only about 300m long, so expect to be a bit disappointed if you do that walk just for that (like me!), but the overall walk is so memorable and lovely (and perfectly fine/safe to do as a female solo traveller) that it doesn't matter in the end.
Plus at Faber peak you can hop on the cable car to Sentosa and head to Mambo Beach Bar (also reviewed by me) for a lovely lunch and couple of drinks on the beach!

Telok Blangah Hill Park was originally part of Mount Faber Park, the ridge that the parks used to share was cut across by the extension of Henderson Road in the mid 1970s. Today, the Telok Blangah Hill Park and Mount Faber Park are connected again by the Henderson Waves at 274 metres long, the longest pedestrian bridge in Singapore.

In fact, the ""walk"" is a grouping of several different walks so when I asked the concierge at my hotel and my taxi driver neither was really sure where I wanted to go and it was difficult for me to understand where I should start this walk.
I decided to take a taxi from my hotel to Hort Park. This was a good choice. When I told the driver I wanted to go to the Southern Ridges Walk he didn't know what that was, but just inside the turnoff into Hort Park I spotted the walkway on the left hand side. Once on the walk everything is very well indicated. I walked towards Henderson Waves on the Forest Walk, which is a walkway high in the air above the tropical forest. Very nice walk and I seemed to be going in the same direction as nearly everyone else. I would highly recommend starting at this point because there were no taxis - or anything else - where I joined the walk so I don't think it is a good place to end the walk. That said, I did not see what was in the other direction from Hort Park - unfortunately, because I couldn't find clear directions about how to do this walk.
After Henderson Waves I continued to Mt. Faber. There was one crosswalk with no directions - the only one of the trip - but keep going upwards until you get to Mt. Faber. From there I decided to take the cable car down. This was quite expensive at SGD29 (actually an obligatory round trip, but I didn't use the return) because very few people take the cable car only to get to Harbour Front and most go on to the entertainment area Sentosa. However, it was a nice ride town. I decided to take it because from the top the walk down did not appear too appealing given that there is a highway separating the Harbour Front from the mountain, but I could see during the cable car ride that in fact the path down looked quite nice and there is an easy way to pass under the highway. So I wouldn't hesitate going either with the cable car or walking.
Getting down from the cable car at Harbour Front means getting off on the 15th floor of a building through which the cable car passes! You take the elevator down and then walk through the cruise ship terminal (clearly indicated) to Vivo City. Vivo City is yet another mall along the water and it a nice place to end your walk because it is full of restaurants (including a Jamie Oliver Italian restaurant) and cafés.
From Vivo City you can take either a taxi or the MRT (métro) so it's very easy to get back to wherever you're going.
The walk itself took me 1 hr and I wasn't hurrying and stopped several times along the way. However, I was by myself so undoubtedly going faster than if you're talking with someone. From Henderson Waves to Mt. Faber walking traffic seemed to be going in both directions. The walk is very easy - not strenuous - and in either direction you will have ascents and descents.",11-2016,Solo,2020-01-30 05:26:54.224875

And - guess what - it is surprisingly COOL! Shaded most of the way and high enough u to catch breezes.

I took the MRT to Kent Ridge and walked back to the Henderson Wave. It is a little more difficult as the signs are more for people doing it from Mt. Fabre and going back to Kent Ridge.

You get off at exit B at Kent Ridge and walk along Science Drive. The hardest part is finding the entrance to the park! There is NO signage at all, but once you get into the park there are signs everywhere. So just walk along Science Drive until you pass a Starbucks. It isn't too much further after that, right after a small bridge.

The Kent Ridge section is actually the most natural and you get some good views over the harbor.

The Canopy walk is nice but really not all that exciting.

Then you connect to Hort Park which is mildly interesting. You could spend a lot of time there but for the walker, it is a pass thru really. You can walk through that a myriad of ways and there are maps everywhere. After you exit it is a very short walk to the bridge of Alexandra Road. It is a unique bridge similar to one down on Robertson Quay.

After that you will walk on a metal pathway to the top of Telok Blangah Hill. Again... Some nice views along the way and it is similar to the Canopy Walk.

At the end you will be in Telok Blangah and you can walk up a steep hill to a viewpoint over Singapore. It is quite nice. If you don't feel like it, you can go around it to the left or right.

You will also pass an old mansion (now high end restaurant) which is quite lovely from the outside.

Finally you will arrive at the Henderson Wave bridge. It offers quite nice views and the architecture is stunning. It is better viewed from afar to the get the full effect though.

At the end you walk through Mt Faber park which is a well establish and old park in Singapore. You can take the cable car or just walk down the Marang path to Harbourfront and Vivo City.

The plus side of doing the walk in the reverse is that you END with a lot of places to eat and drink. If you start at Mt Faber you will only have a Starbucks near the end.

There are a lot of stairs and you should be in reasonable condition. I did whole thing in sandals, no problem.

Take an umbrella because although there are rain shelters along the way, there are some areas with none, so if you get caught in a downpour, you will get VERY wet.

I see it is very convenient for cars to park or taxis to stop at the different spots as well. There are also bus stops near the Henderson Wave and Alexander Road. It is actually quite near to Sentosa and Universal Studios.
I started at the Henderson Wave, a very nice big bridge made of wood that oversee the city. It is very relaxing and calm to be on top. There are a lot of shaded sitting area. I mostly see locals and families there. There are also some tourists, but not a lot.
I walked through the Forest walk afterwards, and it was very quiet. I probably saw an amount of less than 10 people during my walk. I arrived at the Alexander bridge, which is less impressive than the Henderson Waves, mostly because of it's length and height.
I would advice to bring water and a hat, because it is quite sunny and there are not a lot of shades. Don't believe the time it says the walk takes. The Forest Walk said it takes 15 minutes, unless you are running, I don't think anyone would make it in that time.

Between these two ends is about 10 Km or mostly quiet parkland and even some natural semi jungle. If you haven't seen it before, take a stop at Reflections at Bukit Chendu, the museum that tells about the invasion and defence of Singapore in WW2. It's cheap to get in to, and makes a nice addition to the walk. Well presented small museum. The walk isn't hard, with the most difficult part being the heat and humidity. Go early or late to avoid mi day heat. There are a couple of places along the way where you can grab a cold drink (Kent Ridge Park, Hort Park Faber Hill, but remember to take $2 notes, as most are vending machines which only take $2 (you get a coin back in change).

Cheapest and best way to get there is to buy a train/bus card that will set you back SG $12, with $7 in fare and $5 for the card deposit. Top up with an extra $10- $15 and you'll have plenty for a weekend visiting the main sights along the MRT line.

Okay, so get yourself to Harbourfront MRT on the NorthEast line (easier to navigate public transport here than the Tube in London, lots of signs everywhere). From there, do the whole kahuna: around 10km of the trail that is very easy to follow. The highlight for me was the amazing Henderson Waves and, if you're into gardens, you'll enjoy Hort Park.

There's always groups of family and friends on the trail so it's perfectly safe for solo runners (just be sensible at all times, of course and be aware of your surroundings).

At least a handful of car parks along the trail so you can start your run as you want and there's a cafe near the Gardens, complete with public restrooms and a water cooler if you want to take a pit stop.

What they don't tell you in the brochure though is that the Marina Trail is closed for construction. There's still a way in but there's the alternate route just a couple.of hundred metres that also gets you to Faber Peak.

A slow walk will set you back 4 hours or so. Best to start around 9am if you can.

Bring your sunnies, towelette, a bottle of water, an energy bar/snack and an umbrella/raincoat (it's the tropics, hot and humid with showers (brief) expected.

I only had a weekend to spend here but as a nature lover, I'm glad I did this trail as well as MacRitchie (and at night, Gardens by the Bay).

We read the reviews, checked all the maps etc and decided to do the wall from Kent ridge to Mt Faber to make the most of the sunset view.

There are also a lot of other trails in the area that you could easily start down without realising you are in the wrong place.

It is worth doing the walk this way for the exact reasons we did - the sunset and night lights were stunning but take the time to clearly plan the route from the MRT to the start point or take a taxi - there are no helpful signs when you get there.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 05:29:13.460761

If you're a fitness buff this trail wouldn't be an issue for you. However I do have peers who find this slightly tough, especially at the beginning of Marang Trail as it's made up of steps mostly.

,1,27,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/74kst,447032329,28-12-2016,4,Possibly Best Hiking Trail in Singapore,"Singapore is predominantly an urban city. This is probably the closest thing to a hike that you can get in Singapore. Set aside a minimum of 2 hours for the hike itself. Add more time if you will be stopping anywhere.

Suggested things to bring: water, poncho or umbrella (in case of sudden rain), ziplock for your precious phone, and of course money (in case you need to buy food/drinks or give up and take train back!).

As Singapore weather can get rather hot in the late morning, I would suggest starting at around 7 am. Start from the start point beside the motorbike parking lots, in between Seah Im Food Centre and Marang Road. It's on the east (not west) side of the food centre. You can have breakfast at the food centre before the hike, and wash up at the not-so-clean toilets before the hike. This start point is just next to HarbourFront MRT Station.

From there, you hike up a series of steps up Mount Faber to the cable car station. This is the Marang Trail. Then you proceed onto the Faber Trail, with panoramic vies of the Southern Part of Singapore. You end up at Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore at 36 metres above Henderson Road.

Crossing Henderson Waves, you end up in Hilltop Walk, then Forest Walk leading to Alexandra Arch. At this place, you have the option of proceeding westwards towards Flora Walk, HortPark, Canopy Walk and eventually Ken Ridge Park. Or you can turn southwards towards the Labrador Nature & Costal Walk. Normally, at Alexandra Arch, I turn back. Time taken for a normal walk is 1 hour to reach Alexandra Arch and another hour for the return trip. Total distance to Alexandra Arch and back is about 9 km.

If you are hungry on your return trip, you can get down from Henderson Waves, move northwards towards Telok Blangah Way and locate this place called SAFRA Mount Faber. You can try local coffee (kopi) and toast at Ya Kun. Or you can soldier on and return back to Seah Im Food Centre to try other local food including Indian Rojak.

Oh I forgot. If you decide to give up at Alexandra Arch, you can navigate southwards to Labrador Park MRT station. Or you can always hail a taxi or Uber from Hort Park!",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:29:31.902862

There is a lot of useful information found in NPark website. I started early morning from Kent Ridge Park, walking towards Hort Park, across Alexandra Arch, through Telok Blangah Hill Park, crossed the excellent Henderson Waves & to Mount Faber Park. We then walked down Marang Trail and back up again to back-track to Alexandra Arch. We then walked to Labrador Park and back to Hort Park where we continued back to visit the Reflections at Bukit Chandu (and to cool off).
The walking trail is in excellent condition with useful signposts, informative maps, clean functional toilets and interesting views.
The disappointing features are Alkaff Mansion and almost the entire Labrador Park. The museum Reflections at Bukit Chandu is small and has too little interesting exhibit. These low points are too minor to overshadow the overall excellence of the Southern Ridges.
A few tips - bring water, hat, small umbrella; extra clothing to change. There is a mall along Alexandra Road on the way to Labrador Park where you can buy cheap bottled water or patronise the restaurants there. At the start of Marang Trail, there is the cheap Seah Im hawker centre or across the road to the mall, Vivocity.",08-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 05:29:49.468068
