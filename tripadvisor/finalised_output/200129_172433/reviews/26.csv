The best value on planet Earth.,"If I lived anywhere near here, I'd weigh at least 200 kilos. I have travelled a lot and Maxwell Center has a huge variety of amazingly great food at ridiculously cheap prices that is unmatched. Although I have yet to visit every Singapore hawker center, and I know some have a few more blockbuster (Michelin star) stands than others, considering you can get a mouth watering Hainese chicken rice dinner here for the equivalent of US$3 is unbelievable. A few stands down, a spicy bowl of laksa for US$3.5, are you kidding me!!! Add in a half liter ice cold Tiger beer for another US$5...I'm in heaven.

If you are a foodie (or just like eating tasty food) and don't mind dining in an unpretentious self-service environment, you really cannot go wrong at Maxwell Center.

If you are ever in Singapore please go here!",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 05:02:06.266965

But I think the better idea is to look around and check out the different rows of stalls. Our mistake was getting some Hainanese Chicken (the staple dish of Singapore) without look at all the stalls. Had we just spent another 30 seconds to see the next row of stalls, we would have seen the famous Tian Tian chicken stall where there was a long line of foodies. Our Hainanese chicken (from another stall) was cold, and mediocre at best. We also got some Seafood Kway Teow, which was delicious.. and got some steamed dumplings. What I missed here was any INdian food.. which we went to Newton Centre for (it was expensive, but the BEST food we had since coming to Singapore).

Unfortunately, as we tended to view the photos and some of the titles as our method of determining whether stalls had food that we would like we were a little put off as some had some unappetising photos, which I know is a little unfair.

Additionally, the Maxwell Food Centre itself did not seem to be the most hygienic food place that we had visited.

Our children chose a chicken and rice dish from a famous stall that had beaten Gordon Ramsey in a food challenge. They seemed to enjoy it but to my eyes, it looked like plain rice and unseasoned chicken.

I chose seafood pad thai and my wife had another seafood dish from the same stall. we both enjoyed our food and I could have quite easily eaten seconds.

The reason I am a little down on the place is that despite there being many stalls to choose from, there seemed to be little choice based on our appetites. Other reviewers will no doubt have different opinions and enjoy the vast selection of offerings.

I would recommend a visit and I would go again as I think I may have been a little unfair. Incidentally, our favourite Hawker was at Viva City which was lovely.",08-2018,Family,2020-01-30 05:02:32.268372

I was rapt as it was on my to do list to try the chicken rice at Tian Tian. We got there at 11.00am and as it was early there was no queue.
I got a small plate of the chicken rice for 3.50SDG and honestly don’t worry about the chicken itself (which was nice even though its cold) the rice was beautiful. I would have been happy with just a plate of rice. Also tried a small white carrot cake stall 01-53. I am glad I ordered a small plate as it was huge. I liked it, tasted like an omelette with potato. My husband didn’t like it so the next time we went he tried the dark carrot cake which he thought was much nicer. My husband and son had fried chicken nasi lemak which they said was nice. We had 20 minutes at this place till the tour moved on. We passed it around 11.50 and there were huge queues forming so it was really good that we got there early.
We decided to come back that night for dinner. We were told it was best to go early before the major meal times as the queues can get long so we decided to go around 5.00pm. This was too early as more than half the stalls were closed. The whole family ordered the chicken rice from Tian Tian and we also got a fried kway teow from stall 01-53 for 4.00SDG which was ordinary, a small duck rice 4.00SDG from Hong Xiang Hainanese chicken which was nice and a Xing Zhou Mi Fen for 4.00SDGfrom a stall called spinach and soup which was OK.

This centre on the edge of China town is excellent. It has a huge range of outlets with a hugely diverse range of food. We had Chicken rice, the classic dish which is simply that Chicken and rice. Don't be put off though, the flavour is amazing and for $5 Singapore amazing value. Whatever your tastes you'll find something here. I also tried a very unusual combination of fried fish served in a spicy sauce with sesame seeds and a century egg. These are black eggs with a grey-green yolk, reportedly aged for 100 years. It's an acquired taste as it has a subtle ammonia flavour, like a mix of egg with aged Camembert, unusual and needless to say my wife and son thought they were disgusting, I on the other hand thought they were a unique flavour and part of the culinary delight of Singapore. The centre is always thriving, bustling with Singaporeans and a truly fascinating dining experience. If you're on a budget these places are a must because they're so cheap, if you're not they're a must because you get to eat some excellent food with local people. Service is fast and efficient.

1. Chicken rice - Tian tian is the famous stall with a snaking long queue but if queuing is not your style then head a few stalls away to another chicken rice stall which is just as good.

2. Hainanese curry rice - The difference between hainanese curry and indian or malay curry is hainanese curry is less spicy, of a thicker consistency and possibly a little sweeter than its counterparts. I would reccommend the pork chop, chap chye mixed cabbage vegetables and a sunny egg for a complete hainanese curry rice deal!

3. Octopus Ball noodles - One of the few stalls left that does handmade octopus stall in Singapore. The other that I know of is in Hock Hai food centre but the very narrow hours at that stall makes it hard to catch the stall in operation. This is a good alternative. Have it with noodles in soup or dry with a chilli vinegar sauce!

This is like a large food court with over 50 stalls selling various kinds of local food (Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Indonesian and Indian). This is the real fast food, but it is fresh fast food and most stores cook it fresh for each person (esp the soups and porridges). The pricing is so reasonable, you can have 3 satisfying meals a day for well under 10 USD.

The food is authentic as it can get, fresh, hot and tasty. You have a lot of options to choose from. If you want to know the more popular joints in there just look at the crowd in front of each store. My favorite place was a fish soup stall that was the first stall on the left aisle of the middle section.

Foods to try for sure are the Fish Soup, Fish Ball noodle soup (Bee Hoon), Laksa, PadThai, SugarCane Juice and finish it off with a Pisang Goreng (banana fritters). We had 3 meals here to make sure we tasted a good part of it, it is so good :-)",,Family,2020-01-30 05:04:55.845773

Oyster omelette? Yep. Bubble tea? Yep. Good old barbecued meat? Of course. Drink vendors were numerous and sold fresh juice, sodas, and some even beer.

For the best experience, look for a vendor that has a line of people waiting, that means it must be good, right? Naturally, you will have to wait.

The government has imposed very strict hygiene standards. they are checked regularly and the markets are scrubbed and cleaned constantly
This review is to point out to tourist who wants to experience some of the old fashioned hawker stalls with no air-conditioning comfort.
In most hawker centres now, there is nothing to write home about, it depends on individual taste buds and foodie experiences.
Tetsuya once claimed that Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice in Maxwell centre measured up to his taste. Others may find that undercooked? Chicken should be perfectly tender but cooked (equivalent to measuring pasta as ""al dente"")
Another stall that has been there for 40+ years is a favourite for the locals, especially Hokkien (or Fu jian province), the ngo hiang kwang chiang (""sausage"" like with some crispy deep fried pieces of ""dumplings or tau foo (soya bean) is to die for. but, that is an acquired taste.

Most of the stalls here are above average.
Many are well-endorsed by popular food bloggers, celebrities and even the President.
As a local I do eat there some times and it's generally authentic local stuff. Worth a try!
I enjoyed the Chinatown Fritters with fried beehoon rice vermicelli noodles. The fried tofu, egg slice and beancurd skin roll were crispy and tasty. Noodles were A little oily but quite nice. Only $3. Reasonable. Had eaten this before. The chilli is good as usual. A local favorite stall.
Had the Fuzhou Oyster fried cake. My first time. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised! It was nicely fried, crispy and filled with meat, some shrimp, herbs and ouster. Delicious. $2/piece. Loved it.
The real downer was the popular & famous Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice. Rip off. Popularized by top celebrity chefs and hosts like Gordon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain. Disappointed. The taste isn't anything special. It's just good chicken rice how it should taste like but they aren't like the best (to me). It's just how it should be and not wow...
Plus, they definitely rip off tourists. I look fair skinned and spoke in mandarin so the lady possibly thought I was from China. Without asking (even though she could and would) she simply charged me $5 for a plate of chicken rice!! She just keyed into the cash register $5 and took my $5 note.
After I questioned her, chicken rice for $5?? I'm a local! No tourist! Don't cheat me! I know a plate of chicken rice does NOT cost $5! She then sheepishly said, oh some people want $5... I said you didn't even ask - large or small? You just charge me $5 (higher price) cos I look foreign? She then scribbled $3 on the $5 receipt. But she hasn't given me my $2 change until I reminded her... I'm disappointed that they would be out to cheat tourists. I felt distasteful even before eating the food.

Tourist friends, pls tell them directly and do not be cheated. A regular plate of chicken rice in a hawker center does NOT cost $5. It's not a restaurant. No air-conditioning. No service.

The ultimate expression is the Hawker Centers. In the typical Singaporean fashion, they took the vibrant, street food vendors that naturally developed and required them to meet sanitary standards, but the government also provided them great public centers (like food courts) which became popular attractions. The vendors are referred to as Hawkers. They typically specialize in a few or even a single dish. This results in some who have refined the quality of their offerings to world-class standards at very, very affordable prices.

We only had time for one visit to a Hawker Center, so we chose Maxwell Street Food Center, which houses the Hainanese Chicken Rice Hawker made famous by Bourdain. Since Tin Tin is closed on Mondays, and several locals told us that there were better, we chose the one with the longest line. Ah Tai turned out to be the cook who worked for Tin Tin and opened his own place. It was absolutely heavenly. None I've had before, whether Hainanese, Thai, Vietnamese, or Malaysian versions could compare. It was moist, tender and bursting with rich flavor.

The other dish we had to try was the Hainanese Curry. They start with a mound of rice covered with a rich, spicy curry sauce and you chose the items that you want added from over a dozen deliciously prepared items. I opted for squid, shrimp, and eggplant. We loved this concoction. Amazingly delicious.

Each of these were only $5 Singaporean and one of our most memorable meals of our lives.",,Family,2020-01-30 05:05:34.833630

At first he claims great dishes at affordable prices like my duck dish, which i didn't notice but had 8 Sgd on one side and asked for, also had 18 and 22 on the other side; which isn't visible. So as most if not all hawker stalls here aim there meals around 4-8 Singaporean dollars, you don't much notice and then my other half ordered a singaporean crab special.

Let me tell you there was nothing special in fact there was hardly any meat and just hidden under a tonne of sauce. Also the crab had a price but then was blacked out. Finally when we came to pay we had one rice bowl short but as thr 2 previous days were expecting 8 + at most another 8-10 dollars but the bill came to 54 Sgd!!! When I went to question it, he became angry and so my other half just said to pay, as there were other customers waiting and so we did. On top of all this the duck was horrible and my other half hardly had any meat but just a sauce based dish. So please stay away from these people.

Other than that horrible moment, the other times were really good and so, please ask the price and perhaps pay upfront to avoid situations like ours. Happy travels",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 05:06:59.833705

Nothing fancy but seems to be a local favourite. Lots of people however we managed to grab a table fairly quickly as movement is quite fast thought expect to share with others.

Plenty of choices. Mostly around $5 SGD. Portions are not big. We had about 6 dishes and 2 drinks between 2 and spent less than $30 SGD.

We tried the Hainanese Chicken at both Ai Tai and Michelin famous Tian Tian. Both are very tasty and the rice is very fragrant at both locations. Prefer the sauce offered at Ai Tai slightly more especially the chilli sauce. However the chicken meat is slightly superior at Tender. Despite it being breast meat, it is impossibly tender and moist.

In other words, unless you are in the neighborhood, it is not as convenient as other hawker centers which are located right next to a MRT station. It is open air with a roof overhead to provide shade. Food is good and relatively cheap, but as a result, it is crowded. So finding a table during lunch hours is a challenge especially in the hot and humid Singapore weather. So if you want to save a few bucks for good food, this is a good destination. Otherwise the air-conditioned food courts near the Bedok MRT station and the Bugis MRT station to name a few are more comfortable alternatives.",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 05:07:11.054929

1 Work your way around all the stalls and decide what you want to eat.

3 Grab your meal from your chosen stall when it is ready.
4 Optionally grab a drink from one of the drink stalls.
5 Get back to your table.
6 Enjoy.

I had a Mee Hoon Goreng Ikan Bilis from the ""Barrakkath Excellent Briyani Muslim Food"" stall. This basically translates as fried noodles with vegetables and dried anchovies. It was really good. I washed it down with an icy cold tiger which was also really good.

Not silver service and there are no extensive wine lists but the whole thing (mee goreng plus beer) cost about S$10. Good honest food at very reasonable prices.

The guys at the stall told me they do a world beating Biryani. I'm going back to test their claims next time I'm in Singapore",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 05:08:03.650656

I went there for supper/late dinner after 10.30pm, namely for porridge. Hoe Kee Porridge still serves one of the best porridge around. The texture of the porridge is just right - not too thick nor too watery. It is also sufficiently flavoured, not too salty. For a very reasonable price of $3.50 per bowl, it is really value-for-money. The bowl is bigger than that served by the stall in Clementi Hawker or the shop in Tiong Bahru. Besides, for that price, the helping of minced pork balls and sliced pork in it is pretty generous, not just 2-3 slices. The mixed pork porridge also has reasonable amount of pork liver/intestines, slices or minced pork balls in it.

My husband and I also ordered a small plate of oyster omelette ($6) from the Marina South Oyster omelette stall. Helping was reasonable. What I felt could be improved was perhaps frying a little longer so that it is a bit crispier and not too egg-y taste. The oysters given was generous enough and tasted rather fresh.

Well, not very many stalls were opened at that hour. Still a decent place for a good reasonable supper.",,Couples,2020-01-30 05:08:32.592049

Authentic, wholesome and so so tasty. My dish was chilli spiced pork and sticky rice. Very easy to eat with chopsticks, and the flavours.... oh my word. Actually made my tastebuds come alive.

One thing I could not comprehend was the buzzing atmosphere. Everyone so incredibly welcoming and friendly. The vast choice under one roof mind blowing. It actually took about 20 minutes of walking round to decide what I wanted to eat. Worth doing as there is so much choice.

1, Kadayanalur Street, Chinatown, Singapore.

Starting off as a wet market for the Chinatown area in the 1950s, Maxwell Food Centre is now one of the most frequented food centers by both tourists and locals. One can choose from an extensive variety of local authentic Singaporean cuisine with 3 back-to-back rows of 99 stalls. Despite its rustic exterior, the food centre boasts of a wonderful experience inside that feeds a contented crowd of food addicts. Stallholders are still working there through the generations and one of its most famous chicken rice stall has even beaten Gordon Ramsey in a culinary cook off. Maxwell Food Center was placed tops in the City Hawker Food Hunt for three years in running.

The most famous of all is the Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall that proudly display it awards. Jin Hua Fish Soup and Zhen Zhen Porridge also have awards to display and together there are eight other well known and well patronized stalls. A unique stall is named China Street Rickshaw Noodle at stall 87. It was originally a street stall selling economical no frills noodles that rickshaw riders frequent. It is now popular with the ordinary folks of Chinatown. Another unique one is the fried pancake stall that allows patrons to have a hand in frying their pancakes. At 6 (small) pieces for a dollar I would believe it is the cheapest in Singapore. The row that is facing Maxwell Road is ‘reserved’ for Muslim food and mostly Indian stalls can be found here.

When I visited the Center there was a hugh noisy built up area in front and at the side but as there are four entrances you can have access from the non affected sides. The
Thomson Express MRT station will be sitting next to the Center with a line running all the way to Woodlands North and in the very near future the line is to run all the way to Johor, when completed in the last phase. In front and opposite the road you can find and should not miss the large impressive Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. On the side opposite at Maxwell Road junction is a Church which was once a cinema for Mandarin movies. Someone died in there and two seats were always reserved for the spirit that used to haunt the cinema. And on the rear is the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) building. Maxwell Food Center is not difficult to locate.",,Couples,2020-01-30 05:08:47.988898

The place was pretty busy but we managed to find seats without trouble (sometimes sharing tables), although I would say around half the stalls were closed - not sure why!

The chicken rice (I forget the name of the stall, but it had a queue about 20 people long) was very good. It comes in a tasty gravy. A medium portion was 5 SGD, and a small was 3.50 SGD.

We also tried some other stalls and enjoyed the 'carrot cake' - which has no carrot in it at all as far as I can tell, but is a form of rice flour and water which is solidified and cooked with egg in a sauce.

There aren't many choices for vegetarians unfortunately, but there are a few and one place does a tofu clay pot. Green veg cooked in oyster sauce is also available - and tasty! There are drink stalls, some places serving beer, and a few dessert stalls too (such as a kind of filled pancake or banana fritters). You can try food from numerous stalls and eat it at the tables.

At our lunchtime visit it was crowded, noisy, hot and a little smelly, but the most wonderful local experience of old-time Singapore.
As in a lot of the literature, you find a spot to sit and reserve it by leaving an umbrella, packet of tissues, a few business cards with rubber band around them, in fact any personal property to claim your seats. Then wander around the many stalls until you find something delicious, which isn't that hard. Look for the longest lines....that's sure to be the best food. Most stalls now have a sign saying "" self-serve"" which means wait for your food and take it to your own table, rather than the old custom of the stall holders delivering to you.

These hawkers are either 1st, 2nd or 3rd generation hawkers that were brought together and house in this gawker centre during the years when Singapore was developing. One of the famous streets where these hawkers used to sell street food were from China street which is near to the current location of Maxwell Hawker centre. Here you will find some of these hawkers having their signboards with the title of China Street added.

There are many good stalls here notably the following:
1. Prawn Fritters (Ngoh Hiang Kwan Chiang). There are two stalls. One in the middle and another facing Maxwell Road or a church building.
2. A dessert stall serving Tau Suan, peanut soup, and others
3. A delicious porridge stall
4. A great stall selling fish soup
5. A chicken rice stall next to the Tian Tian Chicken Rice. The original Tian Tian cook left and open a stall next to it. There was a fallout. So the current Tian Tian cook is NOT the original cook
6. A fried dough stall selling ""hum chern paeng"" where a lady is frying the dough. This was a dad and daughter team. But the dad had retired. Fun part here is you help them fry the dough. Good snack
7. A lady who took over her mum selling ""tum paeh"". A snack which has oysters embedded. Must try.

So, we hopped on a cab that promptly delivered us to the Maxwell Hawker Centre. It was good timing. The lunch hour was starting. Or maybe not, for when we descended the steps leading to the place, whoa, people were already lined up, sitted, in varying stages of gustatory high.

Follow the cue. The longer the line, the
My wife wanted to explore the Maxwell Hawker Centre because she heard about the Anthony Bourdain endorsed hainanese chicken stall sold only in this haven. She dared we brave the noon heat so try the dish ourselves. The longer the line of people, the better the food. I recall she telling me. But this time, she also said I look for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken stall, for sure there's a line of people. So, I navigated through the spaces and the throng of lunch gladiators. Then there it was. Indeed, the stall had a line that extended to the back. I looked for my spot and I was about 30 people back. I waited for my turn and was rewarded with my purchase of the famous combo meal, with sprouts and bochoy with oyster sauce. And yes, the stall proclaimed it was Anthony Bourdain approved. So like it on Facebook, twit in twitter, hash tag it, post in Instagram and WhatsApp, for the best hainanese chicken rice this side of the world!

Of course there were other finds in the center. One is a stall were the ondeh-ondeh was going fast. I nearly didn't make it as I scored the last order. Yes!

Across Tian Tian is a frust juice stall that have vats of cool drinks that is needed in the Sinagporean lunch heat. I grabbed a lime drink, sugarcane juice and one coconut. Cool and refreshing these drinks that completed the chicken meal.

In Manila where paper napkins are always available in food courts or even hawker like joints, buying this sanitation tool from elderly women, is a bit of a shock. On both counts, buying the paper napkin and the elder woman selling them. But it's also a bit of paying forward.

The location of the Maxwell Hawker Centre is ideal, and easy to find. Though a portion is under renovation, it still offers a lot of food finds that offer excellent eating adventure.

When in Singapore, while there are many such places, if you want to taste the hainanese chicken rice that went viral, as Anthony Bourdain vouched for it, then don't skip this place.

Just wear light cotton clothes, bring your own napkins, and be ready for a savory, sweet, and satisfying food trip.",,Couples,2020-01-30 05:11:23.528268

As far as what to eat, the same principle works - if you see a line, then the food/stall is popular and you won't be disappointed.

Best time for visit would be around 11AM when stalls are prepared to deal with lunch crowds, yet they are not there yet.

It’s a popular spot with locals and tourists alike, and there were a few stalls closed when I was there, maybe due to the post Christmas period.

There were 2 stalls that had long lines and I did line up in one of them, but the line was very slow moving, so I found another stall which seemed popular with locals and bought my spicy chilli chicken and rice to eat.

Getting a table is hard, my recommendation is to find an empty chair or 2 at a table and ask to sit with whoever is already there. I did and got talking to a local family who gave me tips on where to eat at 313@Orchard.

My approach was to find the booth with the longest line (a sure sign of quality is where the locals gravitate) and this was booth 71 (Fu Shun Shao La Mian Jia). For just 3 SGD I got Wonton Noodle (noodles, pork, greens and wontons) and it was sensational. Service was excellent and you watch them prepare the meal in front of you. The stalls selling Hainanese Chicken rice are also popular.

There's something here for whatever you're craving!

I've tried so many things!

-fu zhou oyster pancake: good amount of oysters. Do eat it when it's fresh. Was not a fan of the cilantro addition though. For some reason I had expected it to be crispier?

-almond pudding: DELICIOUS! Must get. Who knew almond pudding could taste so divine? Perfect way to cool down on a hot day for sure. If only I knew it would be so good I would've tried their tofu puddings too but alas I only found this place on my last day.

-tian tian hainese chicken rice: no wonder there's a line at this place during lunch! The chicken was alright but the rice is where it really shines!

-hainese chicken rice (from another stall): there's something magical about the rice of chicken rice (more so than the chicken). It's on the same level as my grandma's chicken.

-cheap pancake thing: it's less than 1 sgd so I got it. The lady was kind of nasty while I was asking about which flavors were available though...so I got red bean. It was passable. I wouldn't get it again...it's basically rice cake.

-soursop juice: one of my best food discoveries during my trip! it tastes like a strawberry and pineapple hybrid! Its flesh was sort of like a tougher version of dragon fruit meets lychee? I wish I could try it again

The only things I'm sad about missing out on are: the rickshaw noodles and the curry hainese rice. Every time I went they were closed unfortunately...if I visit again I'll make sure to make more time to try out more of the stalls here!

I don't know about the bathrooms though as this center is quite old...

There's also a lot of signs around promoting reduction of food waste...so I guess that means if you know you won't be able to finish all your food it's okay to ask for less!

I just highlight a few here, the first is the tian tian lye chicken rice stall which ranks amount the top 3 chicken rice in Singapore in my opinion. (They are comparable to Singapore BEST in this category as the chatterbox of mandarin orchard and POW SING restaurant in serangoon garden, opposite chomp chomp). Their steamed white chicken is so succulent and soft that it could melt in your mouth and the rice itself is so delicious that you could even eat it alone without anything else. The chili and dark soy sauce that come with the chicken rice is so nice that you can never have enough of it. However, the queue could be rather long and usually took about 30 mins in peak hours. The other notable stall is the LIM KEE GORENG pi-sang or banana fritters stall. This so crispy and deliciously sweet and come in generous portion . You can take it as a meal as you could eat one after another without any restraints. The Teochew porridge or AH HENG Porridge comes with very fresh ingredient such as steamed fishes and fishball and other vegetable dishes. Very reasonable prices and tasty indeed. The curry puffs and sardine puffs stall is equally good and so are the drink and fruit juice stalls which also sell fresh coconuts and healthy fruits juice are good value for money. Likewise the thai food stall at the corner looks very appetizing even though I have yet to patronize it . The Chinese restaurant at the other corner sell currey fish head and claypot fog legs looks delicious and prices are reasonable as advertised.

Been to about 10 other Hawker Centres in Sing and this is a bit better than others.
* Cleanliness - So so....
* Atmosphere - Lively & crowded during meal times, obviously
* Food - Above average with a better than usual Hawker Centre mix
You get more tourists here than any other hawker centres around, simply because it is walking distance from Chinatown.
Usual tourist crowd, but coincidentally, it has a very good variety of food ranging from Chinese (mostly), Indian & Malay.
Not just a good mix but also better than average.
Tourists come to Sing for the famous Chicken Rice and this hot spot for tourists have more than its fair share, with more than 3 stalls selling them.
I shall not judge them but the one with the longest queue would be ""Thien Thien Chicken Rice""
I have tasted better.
The famous local saying goes :
"" The stall with the longest queue with the Owner having a long face (in Hokkien: Bin chow chow) must be good ! ""
I do not have a penchant for stall names, however, the best stalls would be the :
* Hum Jin Peng - Chinese donuts minus the hole (to me, the best in Sing)
* Teochew Porridge - Among the best for hawker Teochew porridge (long face/queue)

So it tends to wind down early on weekdays with around half the stalls already being closed by around 8pm, so not the best place for a late night snack. For those new to the concept, visit a hawker stall for a plate of freshly cooked local food for between $3 to $6.

Many of the stalls proudly display their ratings and awards for hygiene and excellence in the production of food, from a number of places, either agencies, etc., so they are keen to clarify their legitimacy in respect of their arts - these are no mere ""barrow boys"". These ""uncles"" and ""aunties"" of Singapore have been feeding the population for a couple of generations now, mostly passing the stalls down to their children. This is some of the finest Singaporean food you will find in the country.

Still operating over the weekend, it's worth noting that only about half the stalls will be open, as the majority of the clientele here are Monday to Friday the office workers. Far less European options here, but in a good way, it's really not the place to go for a burger or a pizza.

Decide to come here to try one of the hot favourite Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But too bad it is closed. Tried to go another famous stall, Zhen Zhen porridge, which is also close yesterday.

Decide try another famous stall, stall #94, ""Ye Lai Xiang Tasty Barbeque"". This is the only one of the few with long queue. This is my first time I notice western food with a long queue at hawker centre. Decide to queue for it and took about 20min. I realise they only open from 6pm to 10pm Monday to Friday only, which is super short working hours for a food centre. Well, and that may explain why the rush for a long queue to try this famous western food.

Also I take note that the stall is rated Grade A in term of hygience, which is of the highest standard. Aside from this, there is sign show they are using healthier choice of oil and ingredients. I thought it is just marketing gimmicks, till when I taste their French fries. Wow! Somehow my first time I saw the French fries Is in light yellow colour and they do not put salt in the French fries. Didn't know they put so much focus on health for their consumer. Thumb Up for that!

Of course what is famous is their chicken chop. A little surprise, they provide huge portion of meat. The sauce is uniquely made by them, not the typical pepper or mushroom sauce. It is of a little sweeter than normal. The meat is tender and taste good.

While I was eating yesterday, i'm surprised two tourists asking me where do buy this western dish and I pointed to them the direction and stall #94. I guess the food presentation looks good so they asked.

Also I order sugar cane drink in one of the stall. Sugar cane drink is common in Singapore Hawker centre. Do try it if you are there.

All in all, I'm pleased with the dinner yesterday. Enjoy your meal!",,Solo,2020-01-30 05:15:30.097489

There, you will find mostly locals wanting a quick but good lunch (or dinner). The place is abuzz with activity. It is just two areas of stalls serving food, or drinks or desserts; so you can pick and choose what you want. You order, grab your food, grab a seat and enjoy.

Low pretense, kind of frenetic, lots of people coming through, reasonable prices too it seemed. Lots of ethnic food too, not all Asian either so even more choices than I thought.

I went to Tian Tian and a few others. Hawker centers are not really my favorite thing but are huge all over Singapore. Still worth going for the experience for sure.

The variety of different dishes is great. Most vendors only sell about 4-5 different dishes but each stall sells different items. Of course some sell things very similar to another stall, but overall they all sell something different.
Meals range around the $4-$7 mark, drinks less than $2.
Food was fresh, prepared in front of you, and a lot of the stall holders speak some English which made ordering easy. They can be a bit forward in how they speak but that’s probably just a language barrier thing rather than them trying to be rude or anything.

It is especially renown, and justifiably so, for Tian Tian Chicken Rice. But that's just one of many excellent meals! I had the best roti pratha ever at Maxwell! Go the egg roti pratha; it's a big snack or small meal accompanied by a plate of 'curry gravy'. Tear off bits of your roti and sop up the delicious curry gravy. Even if you've merely walked your legs off and want to sit a moment over a teh tarik or kopi susu, this is the place!

Suggestion: If you exit Maxwell on the southern end and cross the street and walk one block, 3 or 4 minute walk, you'll come across an historic red brick building in an odd triangular shape. There's a sort of arcade along the far side and if you look up, you'll see the words JINRIKIKSHA STATION carved above about the 3rd arch. Take a photo! This is the historic rickshaw (jinrikisha in Japanese) station where rickshaw operators would queue up and wait for customers.

Many visitors from overseas visit the hawker centre to eat at Tian Tian chicken rice as it has become world famous thanks to the likes of Anthony Boudain, However if that is all you eat there it would be a supreme waste. There are many stalls there that serve good food in a range of cuisine.

1) Dim Sum
2) Popiah (freshly wrapped spring rolls)
3) Rojak (a local style salad with fremented shrimp paste dressing)
4) Porridge
5) Banana fritters (a after meal dessert also eaten as a snack during tea or just because one is peckish)
6) Fried/Boiled Dumplings

The list is endless, however I do recommend that you visit at 11.30 am if you intend to have lunch. The office crowd come in two waves. 12 pm - 1 pm, and 1 pm - 2 pm. If you decide to drop by after that, many of the stalls would have closed up for the day.

A word of advice though, there are many juice stalls there and the prices do vary a little. The stall named juice farm has a rather unagreeable owner who if he decided he doesn't like you for whatever reason, will be rude and unpleasant to the extent that he will harass you at your seat, as long as you seat within view of his stall.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 05:17:40.072627

The only amazing view was the large ceiling fan that had so many blades.I wish I had taken a picture.
There are heaps of shops here and I got sort of lost in the maze of shops.It was in the afternoon.I might begin to wonder how the evening will be.Do try to eat less while on travel.

It was always ""What are we eating today?"", or ""What do you think we should have today?"" an hour before a time remotely appropriate for eating our meals. Perhaps the ravenous urge for the consumption of food comes from our utter boredom with the monotony that living in Singapore is, and perhaps this is also the reason why we love congregating a variety of food stores together that bear food that could possibly tarnish our waistlines.

Newton Food Court has all of that waistline expanding criterion, and more. If you are into touting (illegal as it is), it is the perfect place to be at. Shaped in a colosseum-like circle that reminds one of the Ancient Roman's love for gladiator sparring, the food court possesses the same vibrant and energy of a Flavian Amphitheatre in the late evening. But while instant death is involved in those arenas, slow death through the clogging of your arteries with lard-infused food permeates this particular scene.

Some of the more notable food products that are cardiac-worthy would be the Satay, Hokkien noodles and Beef Noodles.

My verdict is this: Eat if you have the waistline to spare.",,Friends,2020-01-30 05:18:07.926819

Avoid this period if you don't wish to rush with the crowd. Currently, lots of construction due to new mass rapid transit (MRT line- Singapore subway system - causing inefficient ventilation so can be hot inside the hawker centre. Hot favourites are distinguished by the long queues of customers such as chicken rice, roast pork/chicken and fish soup. Food prices (exempted of taxes) are displayed together with pictures of the dishes but please note the pictures are professionally done so should be deemed as representation of the dishes.
Seating (fixed tables and seats) are shared so expect strangers to take the empty seats at your table. Also there's a local practice of seat reservation a.k.a 'chope seats' where diners place umbrella, paper tissue packets, name cards,etc mark the reserved seats or one of the diners will sit at the table to indicate reserved seats.
I recommend a 'cheap/inexpensive and good' 'yong tau foo' store - less than S$4- can get adequate meal of vegetable, toufu (soya bean) stuffed with fresh minced fish meat. Look around the diners to get a sense of the food portions so that you don't over-order your food. I seen foreigners ordering too much food. Most hawkers can speak English and they are fluent in Chinese (dialects and Mandarin) and Malay language. A typical meal - a main dish and a drink/dessert - should cost about S$6-S$8.

Maybe, were a little early, I don't know, but many of the stalls were closed.

We immediately noticed the famed Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall. This was the only stall with a que. Thinking we should try the local delicacy we ordered.

While the chicken was amazingly smoothand tender, both it and the rice were very bland/tasteless. Also the food was barely luke warm.

I accept that we should have explored the food on offer more extensively.

Due to the lack of stalls open there was very little atmosphere.

However, China Town is very close... China Town Food Street is full of stalls cooking hot food to order. ATMOSPHERERIC

Been there 3-4 times and I have tried chicken rice from the famous Tian Tian and also Ah Tian ( 2 doors next door) they are both excellent, I even seem to think that the Ah Tian is slightly better due to serving it the traditional way ( with soup)

Maybe this one or another one close to your hotel but you should defiantly try a hawkers market when you are in Singapore.

They are clean, home made, delicious, and anything you can ask for is there. It gives you a great understanding of why Asians are slimmer ( small servings) and the houses are small ( you do not need a kitchen if you have an eating house next to you.

Visitors to Singapore can't go wrong at these markets, the satay, seafood, rice dishes and specialities from regional areas are all delicious and are delivered to your table quickly and the beer is cold and at a reasonable price. The mixture of local people and tourists add to the vibrant nature of the markets and is a great way to start your evening on the streets of Singore.

Here's some of the dishes I'd recommend
Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice - it's a well trodden foodie path, it's no nonsense, it's succulent, and the rice is fragrant. There is no bs here.
Maxwell centre Fuzhou Oyster cake - stuffed with pork mince,prawns and oyster, it's deep fried and a great tasty snack - kind of like a big flattish takoyaki - it's piping hot so be careful
Ondeh-Ondeh tapioca cake: a good not too sweet snack to finish off your meal, also purchase a sugar cane juice to cool you down

Some tips:
*Avoid lunch time
*Grab a table first, reserve a seat by placing a business card, tissue packet or something else (of non value) on the seat.
*Most places are self-service (no, this doesn't mean you plate your own food, just means you wait at the stall and take your food to your own table). Some places will bring your food to you, so grab a table and remember the table number.
Halal and non-halal food are served on different coloured plates so do not mix them when you're finished - stack your plates so it's easier for a cleaner to take. Don't use halal food cutlery on non-halal food unless it's disposable.
*Just enjoy the experience. It's cheap and cheerful at it's best

I didn't think its worth the queue, not that its no good, but as chicken rice is so common, there are many other places that's very tasty too.

This place is still worth visiting even if u don't eat the chicken rice. You can find lots of local food there, and experience the setting of a typical ""hawker center"" - where lots of tasty cheap eats awaits you. I just find queuing more than an hour under the sweltering heat is a waste of time and energy..

Don't just chose any other chicken rice stalls over there, i tried one, i regret.

Tip 1: I will skip the queue by going to other branches of ""Tian Tian"" to enjoy this dish. Their restaurant outlets can be more expensive, but heck, time is money. Decide on a branch with good reviews and location to suit your travel itinerary.

Tip 2: Try the fried banana at this stall called ""Lim Kee"". It can be quite filling, so do a take away, but have it while its still relatively hot and it will be nice and crunchy.",,Friends,2020-01-30 05:19:46.117392

Maxwell does offer almost everything every tourist should eat, although not the best of the best, it is still a great sample taste of what Singapore has to offer.
Do skip the long line for Tian Tian Hainan Chicken rice as it is mediocre and very hyped up. There are lots of stalls that do offer better chicken rice than Tian Tian.
If it's your first time in singapore, here's a list of thing that you must try.
Hainan chicken rice, Laksa, Hokkien mee, Fish Beehoon, Bak Kut Teh. and for dessert, Ice Kachang, almond pudding and soy pudding. enjoy.",,Friends,2020-01-30 05:20:12.997614

One vendor sold coconut & peanut pancake slices that were so good I wish I could have them again. prices were so reasonable unlike some of the restaurants we saw.

The atmosphere was just perfect, many hawkers try to offer you a seat or food in a very decent and kind way, nothing like the guys in the Thailand's Kawasan.

And the food was just great.

Tips for newbies:
1. Sit outside on the street.
2. Order a pitcher of Tiger beer.
3. Order 15 pieces of chicken satay.
4. Order napkins from the old guy.

The fact is, hawker centers (and their smaller cousins, coffee shops, aka kopitiams), are located across the entire island. Maxwell, however, is located near the center of town, with many tourist hotels nearby, and Anthony Bourdain and many locals say that Tian Tian's chicken rice is the best and therefore a ""must-try."" There are plenty of other savory local foods at Maxwell besides chicken rice, however -- I would come back to Maxwell multiple times if staying nearby and try to sample as many as possible. Many stalls may not be open at night and are more likely open during the day on a weekday.

Lines can be long at Tian Tian (but not always). Try Ah Tian, which was founded by a former Tian Tian chef. Is one really better than the other? Hard to tell, but many people have differing opinions.",,Friends,2020-01-30 05:20:25.087355
