Toilet was clean and love the bathtub which was at the shower area. The floor around the basin would not be wet with such design.

The security guards were prompt in providing first aid to my gal when she fell down. They quickly provide us with ice pack and told us to look for them if my gal was unwell in the middle of the night. Kudos to their first class service.

I would suggest doing this attraction instead of the flyer as the views are spectacular! Although very windy so don’t take a hat! You can spend as much time up there was you want at there are places to buy fast food and drink, souvenirs. The views are of the city itself and of gardens by the bay. You do get a small view of the swimming pool but the views of the other side of far better! It is rather pricy however what the facilities provided as once you get up there the isn’t much to do other than look out... would advise an hour max at this attraction",12-2019,Family,2020-01-29 13:09:49.187759

It's misleading to think the bar entry is free since both work out to be similar in cost.

Both have limited access to the top deck. With the bar, you are also limited by where you get seated. The outermost seats are still behind the observation deck. At the northern end, the observation deck extends at least 20 meters away from where the bar seating ends.

Views are beautiful and a must see but once you have looked around there is not much else to see. I’m sure you could pay extra to go to the pool area but we didn’t.

It lived up to our expectations and then some. 360 degree views of the city and harbour were absolutely stunning, including a Birdseye view of the other bucket list item, Gardens by the Bay.
Reasonably priced and easily accessed, it is an absolute must do when in Singapore. A photographers haven, but if you want the professional touch, a professional photographer is on hand and for a reasonable fee, will supply you a selection of amazing shots using green screen technology.

Located 57 storeys up from the heart of the Marina Bay area, the Sands SkyPark Observation Deck boasts scenic views of the panoramic vistas of Marina Bay and Singapore’s world-class cityscape. Take in a bird’s-eye view of Gardens by the Bay and the impressive Supertree Grove, or admire the sea view that stretches from Marina South Pier to the Singapore Strait.

From above, try your hand at spotting Singapore’s iconic landmarks. Look out for the capsules on the Singapore Flyer and the durian-shaped domes of the Esplanade – or the Merlion statue, another major tourist attraction in Singapore. Be sure to also keep an eye out for the orange-tiled roofs of the shophouses along the Singapore River.",10-2019,Family,2020-01-29 13:10:03.385474

When you stand at Skypark observation deck, you can have overall view of Singapore, from Marina Bay, Garden By the Bay, Ferris wheel until Singapore’s port. At 9 p.m, standing at Skypark, you can see whole of musical fountain show is performed at Marina Bay. It’s very nice. But there is one thing that i feel unhappy at here. Gate pass price is expensive, about 25 SGD for one person but they don’t offer any complimentary drink, even one simple and cheap kind of drinks is mineral water. And they don’t have any free chair for you can sit. You must sit on the floor if you don’t want to stand for a long time. If you want to sit on chair, you must come in the restaurant there and pay for drinks. Price of drinks in this restaurant is more expensive than the price at the ground around Marina Bay Sand Hotel about four times.

To start, the hotel itself is stunning, impeccably clean, offers industry leading service, and everything one would expect from a world class hotel.

The pool and clubs become overrun by club-goers and swimmers later in the day and into the evening.

We found the very best time to enjoy the views and a splash was right when the pool opens st 6am. And since we had arrived the previous night after 20 hours of air travel, we were happy to open the pool after a nice night’s rest.

We'd seen photographs and read about the infinity pool and although we knew we wouldn't be able to swim in the pool (that privilege is reserved for residents) we were looking forward to seeing it up close. The lift to the top takes you up one side of the hotel and it is almost impossible to get a view of the pool. However, there are still some very impressive views from the top and I'd still recommend doing this. That said I actually thought the Marina Bay Sands hotel was more impressive from the ground.

Yes it can be. However not everyone wades to infinity side of pool and stay there for two hours from the best time of the day to soak in an awesome view of the city skyline and Bay between 6pm to nearly 8pm. If you stay at this hotel but do not find time to take a quick plunge, it’s a real pity as I strongly believe a huge part of your hotel bill is incorporated here. We stayed in a high floor VIP room with balcony and a view on the opposite side, the entire Gardens by the Bay. Good news is you can catch both of these views from the top floor pool area. There’s a laser light show around 8pm but not much to appreciate as it’s better viewed from opposite side of the hotel across the Bay. After your pool experience ending 7pm ish, head opposite to Gluttons corner or MakanSutra if you wish to avoid the expensive MBS restaurants, some over rated. From there, aside to catching the laser show, you get to experience all the common famous local cuisine from one place with multiple food hawkers, Bring your own napkins as it’s not a napkin friendly place for the OCD types!:) There is a hidden rest room at MakanSutra where you could also wash your hands after indulging with crabs and other dishes but you have to ask one of the stall owners to know that little small “alley” to the rest rooms.",03-2019,Family,2020-01-29 13:10:11.860720

Straight to the main entrance of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Access to the skypark is at Tower 3 so to save a long walk through the shopping arcade past Tower 1 and 2 next time I would ask the taxi to drop us right at Tower 3 where the sky park entrance is located. There was no queue as it was daytime. One hassle was the photographers near the lift entrance. They try to encourage you to have your photo taken but I refused and walked straight past. The lift to the 56th floor was so fast it felt like we only went up three floors and not 56. I was dreading the crush in the lift but we were the only ones in the lift so it was a breeze. The view from the roof deck was amazing of course. There is no access to the infinity pool only though the hotel. There is a snack bar and gift shop on the roof deck and a bigger outside bar just above but they told me if you enter that bar you cannot re enter the viewing platform so again I declined. Why that should be the rule I do not know. After a short visit my daughter started to feel ill from the height so we went back down in the almost empty lift. By passed the aggressive photo sellers and brought a few mementos at the tiny gift shop near the entrance. The cost of entry was reduced for pensioners and children. 17 dollars for my daughter as she was under 12 and 20 dollars for me as I was a pensioner ( might be wrong about the pensioner concession perhaps it was a bit less than $20.), but there is also a special deal which includes the hop on hop off bus tour for one day which looks good. We did not use that service but we did enjoy some tasty french patisserie at the shop just inside near Tower 3 check in. We caught a taxi from there to the Merlion Statue which is not too far away just across the inlet. To get the most benefit I think if we had time we would have gone up at sunset to see the lights of Singapore come on. There is no time limit to how long you can stay up there. Toilets are handy and wheel chair access would be easy if you just wanted the viewing platform. Reading some of the other reviews I see if you just want to go to the roof top bar its free to go up and you can still see the views. (So that's why you cannot access the viewing platform from that bar). We just made it back to the Airport in four hours using the underground train in good time to check in for our flight.",02-2019,Family,2020-01-29 13:11:46.094452

The entrance is not from inside the hotel but instead from the entrance of Hotel Tower 3 (nearest one). SGD 23 at the current time is the fee.

The view up from the observation deck is mesmerising and excellent - especially at night. The city looks much more beautiful in the night than in the day, actually. The Supertree Grove, Indoor Conservatoires, Singapore Eye, the sea, the tall imposing buildings of HSBC, Citi, etc. are a sight to behold.

A light and water show takes place at 8 and 9 pm every day and additional show at 10 pm takes place during Friday and Saturday. Though I saw the show from top, I recommend travellers to view it from the ground level.

There's a restaurant and bar there, CELAVI, where we didn't eat or drink anything, though. Definitely, I'd recommend Sands Skypark Observation Deck and it is rightfully the 9th Top Thing to do in Singapore!",11-2018,Family,2020-01-29 13:12:27.626324

It is stunning to see from ground level, and the view from the top is equally stunning. I loved every minute of my visit to the top, where we had a meal in CeLaVi restaurant. Everything was fabulous but I have to say that I did not find the guide books particularly helpful in deciding what ""package"" to take to visit the rooftop, so this is an attempt to be a practical guide to help you make up your mind. The first thing to remember is that large sections of the roof gardens, including the infinity pool, are CLOSED to day visitors and are only available to hotel guests. The second point is that if you visit the restaurant, the viewing deck one floor below is NOT available to restaurant guests unless you have paid a separate fee of S$23 per person (the price as at August 2018). The third point is that guide books tend to point out that if you eat at the top, then you save the S$23 per person. That is true, but you do not get quite the same view, because the public deck one floor below the restaurant sticks out further than the restaurant deck and you are right at the edge of the viewing platform, something that you cannot achieve from the restaurant deck. Furthermore, the fixed price lunch menu is S$45-55, plus 10% service plus 7% tax, and this is without drinks, so on a net basis you can easily end up spending quite a lot on lunch. So here is my advice. If you want to have the eating experience, fine. The food is very good and the atmosphere is great. If you want the view, but think that for a little extra over and above the fee of S$23 you can get a nice meal, you are mistaken. The additional costs is likely to end up much more than you think. So make sure that you know what you want!",08-2018,Family,2020-01-29 13:13:14.079032

No wait, the entrance fee was slightly lower ($20)and you get food/drink vouchers for the same value. Kids were free.

Once you have finished on the 56th floor you can go in to the bar area and get a drink, but once you go in you can't go back out, you can only go to the 57th floor, where the infinity pool is.

There is also a kiddy pool with glass panels around them. Pool guards are vigilant all the time.

Food and drink is exorbitant. $10++ for fruit juice. But the food was good. We ordered a side to share as my 4yo was hungry but unwilling to leave the pool just yet.

,1,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/garieo,549660676,28-12-2017,1,This place is a sham,"This place is a sham.

1. Assume flawless customer service: Once you enter the actual deck, you’ll see that it’s so obviously a cash cow. The views you see from the deck can just as easily be seen from one of the bridges near the Merlion park. Plus you get to see the Marina Bay Sands as well from those bridges. So the SkyPark really defeats its own purpose because the Sands is a pivotal part of the Singapore skyline. Definitely not worth SGD23. You don’t even get to enter the infinity pool area unless you’re a guest.

2. Is the quality of customer service actually flawless, at least? Definitely not. In fact, I would call it disingenuous at best. When we were buying the tickets, we asked if we can enter the deck twice (at day and at night). To be sure, we asked the same question twice, each question phrased differently. We were told we could as long as it’s within the same day, only to be told later on that we couldn’t. It really put a damper on the already mediocre experience. It would’ve been fine as long as we were given the information we needed, so at least we could have planned to enter at night (which we would’ve preferred if we had to choose), but we weren’t. I’m not sure if the sales personnel are given a quota, but there’s definitely a lie or a cheat somewhere there.

If you insist on visiting the SkyPark despite all this, I’d recommend you (1) visit at nighttime, and (2) not buy from Vincent. Otherwise you’ll find yourself paying SGD23 for an elevator ride.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-29 13:16:38.970855

Timings are 9AM till 10PM. Longer on weekends occasionally.

Best time to visit is after 6PM when it starts to get slightly dark and the city lights are switched on. Wander along the perimeter amount the views, and you can grab some quick bites in the stall. Reasonably priced for a place like this (Singaporeans will understand what I mean). There is a restaurant on the sub above level here. Where you can sit and enjoy a drink and the view. But please note that, once you enter the restaurant, you cannot enter the observation deck again, and can only exit the skypark from there. Hence plan accordingly.

After about an hour of view and selfies and photos, around 7.30/45 PM, reach the side from where you can view the Gardens by the bay. The light show will start, and you can watch it for free from here. You need to pay to enter the Gardens by the bay area on the ground. So enjoy it from here, you will see most of the lights, and with the occasional draft the music also carries.
After this, head on to the other side of the deck to view the laser light show in front of the promenade, merlion. I was lucky enough to watch the star wars themed show on the day of the last Jedi release.
So, apart from the panoramic views, you can enjoy the light shows if you plan the time right and get back with 3 for the price if 1.

Some tips & tricks make it better though!,"As first time visitors to Singapore, Marina Bay Sands was on the top of our list to visit and experience. We headed off in a cab (which is easy and affordable to do in Singapore). We arrived having been given the tip to ask to go to CE LA VI restaurant (located within the Sky Park) instead of just entering the general Sky Park area.
As our taxi dropped us on the opposite side of the road, it was quite a challenge to actually head over to the Sky Park entrance (so I would specify to the taxi driver that you want to go to Sky Park, rather than just Marina Bay Sands as we said). We enquired at a general enquiry counter as we couldn't work out how to get over the road (it's a big road!) and also asked about making a booking at CE LA VI restaurant. If that is something you are interested in, I would recommend you book some time in advance! It is quite highly priced (to much for us) and it was booked out anyway. Amazingly we were offered an opportunity to ""squeeze in"" for the small additional charge of $500 SD. We declined that fantastic and generous offer and wandered over and paid the $20 admission to enter the general bar area of CE LA VI. The good thing about this charge is that you can redeem it on a drink from their bar. CE LA VI is set back from the edge of the Marina Bay Sands but you can still admire the amazing views of the Singapore skyline. If you walk around to the side of the building that looks out over Gardens on the Bay, you can get right up to the edge however and also get a glimpse of the infinity pool to your right. The bar area is very crowded and busy and we had to shuffle forward to finally get a position at the front where we could enjoy our $27SD drinks and take in the view. There is smoking in this area which was a little annoying as we had our 17 year old daughter with us, plus lots of full ashtrays on the tables.

My daughter and I returned to Marina Bay Sands they following night (sans husband) and entered via the general viewing entrance ($26SD...or about). This was a great experience. No drink included but it wasn't as crowded and we could get more aspects and photos of the Singapore skyline. Both experiences were worthwhile and two visits was also a good idea too (if you have time).

Firstly access is well controlled and secured. Making this a privilege experience (only hotel or paying guests can get in). Once you step into the Skypark past the gantry, the first view that welcome you takes your breath away. As you go down the staircase, you can't help but to fish out your camera or mobile phone and start taking picture after picture. On the day we were there, weather was good, the sun and the breeze, makes you think if only you can get a deck chair and lay there to enjoy the breathtaking view (you can technically but it's at the Infinity Pool instead). You will get a close to 270 degree view of our island landscape. The Marina Bay CBD, Gardens By The Bay, stretches all the way to our Sports Hub and Sentosa.

The towers house Ultra luxury brands for shopping, amazing restaurants and a sky park for viewing the city and ocean scape and an amazing infinity pool. While it’s done brilliantly I think it looks a tad bit strange. You should consider staying a night here on during a holiday.
That said a visit is still possible in one of the following ways:
A. Visit the shopping area and the hotel
B. Buy a ticket to the 56th floor (one but top) for access to the sky park to view the city from atop. This gives a slightly similar perspective as the Singapore flyer.
C. Visit the Ce la Vie restaurent/bar on the 57th floor. The access charge is SGD 20 and redeemable against dining bill. (My preferred option). The idea of leisurely taking in the views over a good meal appeals more to me. There are two sides offering the city view and the ocean view. The food is nice.

In the end we were trying to make sense of what we just saw, but alas, no good - just something put together to look good but awfully themeless.
The view from this Skypark though is quite spectacular - the whole of Singapore, promenade the Flyer etc can be seen from this place.

Unfortunately, now they are making a big deal about going up. You are first herded into a line for the lift, a bunch of staff there are quite bossy and rude, and when you arrive above you are met by a real hard sell from a bunch of quite rude guys trying to sell you a photo. The photo is expensive SGD60 and it's not even in front its basically photoshopped. Also, $60 for a photo is just extortionate and they make you believe you have to buy it.

As we were travelling with out two children aged 9 and 11, this was our only option. We were not disappointed by the quality of the rooms or the views, they were magnificent and worth the room rates. The cleaning was exceptional and we were really looked after with well appointed rooms. However, we found staff mostly indifferent to us and quite usually unhelpful when asking about appropriate venues for family dining. Most of the staff were moody and solemn and we were directed to highly inappropriate family venues on several occasions over our 4 day stay. The pool lives up to it's dazzling view promise however it is EXTREMELY CROWDED however it is very well policed by staff Life Guards who do a really wonderful job. Given that you cannot tell people what to do, the amount of selfie sticks made me more dizzy than the height! There is a separate pool for ""adults only"". Given the many adults swimming in the family area without children, I think it would be useful for those people to swim in the appropriate area so that families don't have to feel uncomfortable about who might be photographing their children. Pool dining menu is limited and not very interesting. I ordered a Caesar salad (requesting dressing on the side) and this consisted of a bowl of Cos lettuce with grated parmesan cheese (anchovy dressing on side - I cannot eat mayo). Service was slow.

We travelled up mid morning and took lots of photographs in all directions overlooking the whole skyline. Absolutely brilliant, and some useful guides to the Singapore features in each direction.

But then, the heavens opened. Typical shower, really heavy and powerful. Unfortunately there isn’t much cover up on the observation deck so this pretty much cut short our visit. Just as well we got our photos in early.

Although the ticket allows you to stay up on the deck as long as you want, there is no re-entry option which was a bit disappointing.

Overall though, well worth a visit.",09-2017,Family,2020-01-29 13:17:35.706770

The sky park, for someone not staying at the hotel, isn't really a park at all because all the greenery is in the guests-only area. So what you get is more like the deck of a ship with a bar, a snack bar and gift shop thrown in.

Having said all that, the views are fantastic. And if you are prepared to time your visit for just before sunset, you can get some amazing views/photos of Singapore by day and night.

You can catch a glimpse of the hotel's infinity pool as you look back along the curved edge of the ""ship"". But it's the wrong angle to see the infinity view. I came here a few years ago when you could still get into the pool area but, sadly, that is all closed to the public now.

Finally, once you have drunk in as many vistas as you can handle, you will have the opportunity to purchase the obligatory ""green screen"" photo of your group. The initial asking price is eye-popping, but I managed to haggle down to less than a third of that by forgoing the leather frame and digital download!

After the show, I suggest you to make a left. You'll see the Merlion = Singapore's symbol. Then continue along the lake. You'll pass a nice bridge. Once on the other bank, make a left to visit Gardens by the Bay. I think the best time to visit is at night because there is another light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45.

It ends as soon as it starts. Was expected a bigger area to stroll and get the views but you just get access to less than 1/4 of the total area - The remaining area is for hotel guests and pool. So you do not get the 360 view from the top and just partial view over looking gardens by the bay, singapore flyer and some part of singapore river and ships docked at the sea.

Its ok just to visit and tick that to do / must visit list.
You can get better views and similar height from singapore flyer just a few meters away or as i was told later, get the entry cover for the sky bar and sip the drink while having a proper seat at the bar.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-29 13:18:54.575418

I remember vividly the days when we used to drive past MBS en route to our office; the three towers and the ship's arc still under construction. And the usual wait of a few months until the obsessive child-like craze of Singaporeans to anything new cooled off, before we attempted our first visit to the place.

Since then I have made numerous trips to the SkyPark with friends and family, including the latest visit in Mar 17 during my son's school break. On each occasion I have never ceased to be amazed with the architectural marvel that the SkyPark is, not to mention the expansive breathtaking views it offers.

The public access deck is built like an arc, on the one side you can see the Gardens by the Bay, in the centre it looks out to the east of Singapore and the other side gives you an intimate feel for the beautiful CBD. They have long since stopped access to the sky pool but the public access deck in itself is so absorbing, that sky pool or not the SkyPark is more than worth a visit.

I would strongly recommend visitors to book for late afternoon and early evening and stay on to watch the sunset. It's a beatific feeling, one that you will savor for a long time.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-29 13:19:49.600284

The good: the view is nice.. it's roomy. Um... the view is.... um... nice.

The not so good: Does not represent good value for money. Needs a cafe or bar up top. Not outdoor shelter against the rain. Expensive. They charged an asleep 2 year old $17.

There are plenty of towers and observation decks in Singapore. Plenty of roof top bars and attractions such as the flyer, Sentosa cable car etc that will offer great views.

I suppose it is a must do when in Singapore as the unique architecture of the building certainly beckons wherever you are in the city. We went mid morning and I'm sure it is spectacular at sunset and the evening.

It would have been a nice place to visit if you were able to sit and enjoy the view with a coffee or a wine for a while but that is not possible. Despite the cost to get up to the top with a family it seems they don't want you to stay too long so they can keep sending more people up. Staff take your photo at the bottom and by the time you reach the top it has been badly photoshopped onto a background and they try the hard sell to get you to buy!!!. It was a good opportunity to see the views but don't plan on being there for long, also because there is no where to sit people sit next to the glass edge and this also limits your options to take pictures and read the view facts.

I knew it was big and have been to plenty of large hotels. It was the first time that I had to wait in a managed queue line to check in to a 5 star hotel. In reality It is at best 3.5 stars.
It's owned and run by the holding company that owned similar monstrosities in Las Vagus. So I guess if that is what you are after this hotel is for you.

Our family room was comfortable for 4 of us but the room was beginning to show it's age and the musty smell beginning to creep in.

The building is an engineering masterpiece.
The only other positive was the roof top pool. To get to it we had to use 3 different lifts and every single person, including kids need their own room key to get in. Once there it was a scramble to get a bed. There was people everywhere!

I realised fairly early that I made a mistake in booking this hotel. My 3 night stay booking made directly with the hotel were deemed non changeable by the guest processing officer and I was told politely to sod off.",12-2016,Family,2020-01-29 13:21:58.151054

Go up on a clear day or evening to get the most from your visit and make sure you have a camera to hand.

At checkout all i had to do was fill in a form and drop it in a box and leave.
At checkin had to wait a while for check in queue as it was quite busy as youvwould expected. We were confused as there were no sign to where checking was. Had to ask someone for help.
Wasnt happy with one staff as they asked if we wanted to pay more as we requested rooms close by. We have 3 kids and didnt want to be in rooms too far apart.
We were told we will recieve email once rooms are ready. Waited and nothing so had to go checkin desk again to ask.
Served by another staff who was very nice and efficient and professional. Told us she found us rooms available next to each other. Really appreciated her effort as it made a big diff when your travelling with small kids.
Rooms were nice clean modern and felt luxurious. Large nice showers/ bathroom. We stayed in deluxe room on the 20th floor. Spectacular views of the gardens by the bay. Was special waking up and opening your curtains to that. I think the gardens view is way nicer than city view and saves you a bit :) Each room had a nice large balcony. No outdoor furniture though, not even a wicker chair to sit and enjoy the view which is puzzling.
Lots of shops mostly high end brands. Restaurants cafes pharmacy small supermarket....prices generally exp. Affordable food court goid for kids on lower floor.
Lastly the infinty pool. WOW. Spectacular views day or night. Just feel unreal swimming up there. Clean and well maintained. Family friendly. Kids had so much fun they didnt want to leave.

I highly recommend this walk if you can manage it. We saw it all lit up in its glory across the water than walked across the bridge to it. This in itself was an amazing experience. As you enter the building you see the large scale, massive area spread out with glamorous shops. If you have lots of money to spend you will be at home here. We walked through past the casino etc to the skypark. You start to feel a little like you are in a maze and definitely not for anyone who may be afraid of heights or suffer from claustrophobic. The process to buy tickets and get to the deck is seamless. However I will add that the photo idea is really a bit expensive. With printing prices so reasonable these days no one can justify paying $50 Singapore dollars for a pic. Once you get to the deck I cannot describe to you exactly what's it's like. But you will get wowed by seeing Singapore lit up before you. They don't do things by halves here. Loved it. For the photographers out there.. well worth the money.

,1,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mikeazzo,419376879,17-09-2016,5,See the SAME view for a fraction of the price!,"OK , I wasn't going to pay $23 per adult and $17 for my child ($63$ total) to go up to see the view so here's how I got the same view much cheaper!

1) The entrance to Skypark and Ce Le Vie bar/restaurant are near eachother. The Skypark is outside the main lobby entrance through a glass door to the right. Escalators take you down. You don't want this! The Ce Le Vie bar is what we want. Go into the hotel lobby (the one with the sports cars oustide), to the left of the Skypark glass doors entrance, and the Ce Le Vie entrance is immediately RIGHT. Someone will be there. Friendly of course like most Singpore folk.

2) Say you want to have a drink. They will let you go in the lift to the bar/restaurant. Remember it opens at 12PM. Now heres the fun bit! You use the SAME lift as those paying for the skypark! But you got in for FREE! HA HA! What made me laugh is that the lift has 4 buttons. The ground (where you get on), basement (where the skypark customers paying for expensive tickets get on), FLOOR 57, which is the Skypark, and FLOOR 58 which is the Ce le vie bar/restaurant, which is what you want. It is the same outdoor view both sides of the building.

3) Once you get off at 58, you can see the SAME marvelous view of Singapore and Gardens of the Bay just by buying some drinks.

We bought an iced tea, coke and some water for around $18. MUCH CHEAPER than the $63 the Skypark was going to cost! AND we had a seat, AND we had drinks!
You can also see the infinity pool but only guests can enter. We wasn't rushed either.

Hope this is helpful! Please save some money feel free to add thanks!
Thank you!",08-2016,Family,2020-01-29 13:23:38.913700

The bars were heaving, the drinks expensive and there was a feeling of 'one in, out out' about the whole place that made the experience very impersonal. Singapore is a place where money rules, and no more so than at MBS Skypark. There was no where to sit, so it was standing room only. There was a scrum to get up to the top floor and lots of VIP only designations which meant the space available was much smaller than you would expect for such a large area. The foyer on the ground floor is just like a huge shopping mall. I can't imagine anyone feels much sense of personal service anywhere.",08-2016,Family,2020-01-29 13:23:56.495330

The elevator was so quiet and fast I was able to get my nerves together. Once the elevator arrives you don't step right out on the roof so once again you can settle into it. Once out on the deck the site is unbelievable. I would recommend doing this during the day because picture taking became harder in the dark. I imagine sunsets would be great. Also, it cost to get up to the lookout but there is a bar / restaurant up there that can only be accessed thru hotel elevators.

We had a wonderful time and staff were very accommodating, especially with families travelling with children (our daughter was 1.4 years old in a pram at the time).

The thrill of going up in a lift in less than 1 minute; numbered B, 1, 2, 56, 57 is very cool.

As we came out of the lift on Floor 57, and out of the hallway, we were greeted by a walkway of approx. 4m in wide and large curved glass sheets approx. 5m high – with a Stunning view of the sea, Gardens by the Bay and the green houses (The Flower Dome etc.)
As we walked around the circumference of the observatory desk, we could see different views of Singapore. One on side Gardens by the Bay, and on the other side the high rise buildings of the Financial district. Absolutely breathtaking whilst feeling warm air sweep my hair.

Can capture some great pictures of each angle, though could not find a single place to capture the whole 360 degree view on camera. (perhaps a video-camera would have done the trick).

There is always so many things to do here. There is something for everyone. In fact, one can spend the entire day here and never get bored.

My family and I visit here every time we are in Singapore. My father and husband like the casino, my mother likes the sky park, I like the shopping, my sister likes the ice skating ring next to the food court and of course, we all love the food court!

Although most of the shops are all very high end designer brands, one can always have a wonderful time window shopping or actually shop from the array of regular shops too. The skating ring is always a lot of fun and the food court is quite diverse with a good range of different types of cuisines.

I would highlt recommend going to see what plays or musicals they are showing at the theatre, which is also housed there. My mother and I have enjoyed conerts, musicals and plays there, even music festivals too. The trick is to do the research a couple of weeks before travel and then book the tickets online.

The sky park is a nice place to take a break from mall and the other attractions. There is a wonderful lilly pond where one can sit and enjoy the skyline and take photos. It is also possible to take a amoke break there. That ia something my husband always keeps track of since he is a smoker and Singapore is quite strict about, well, everything.

And last but not least, the institution houses the only casino in the country and is a must visit for those interested. There's a smoking floor and a non smoking floor as well, which is wonderful. And every kind of game you want to play. There are some reataurants too. But nothing to write home about. And it is open 24/7.

And if you find yourself really enjoying this institution I would recommend staying at the hotel. It does house the largest swimming pool in Singapore. All the way on the roof and in the shape of a ship. It really is one of a kind and therefore has become an icon. It is quite expensive but nothing is too expensive if one plans ahead.",11-2015,Family,2020-01-29 13:27:15.031002

I have heard so many bad things about this hotel from friends all over the world but I just wanted to give it try. So I set my expectations to low to begin with.
Well check in was terrible. Counter staff told us room wasn't ready just because she could not get hold of housekeeping. She made us wait for 45mins without explaining what went wrong. Check in time was 3pm and we waited till 345pm to get the keys.
Room service was prompt but the collection of food tray may take 6 hours.
Hotel made a boo-boo by forgetting to reserve a table at Mozza for us. My husband called to check at the hotel if a reservation was made. Instead of helping, the reservation desk at Mozza, Joanne, was so rude we decided not to eat there ever again no matter how good the food is. She was condescending and acted in the most inappropriate way for a service staff. Instead we decided to splurge $700 on a fantastic dinner at Imperial Treasure!
The hotel felt bad and apologized with a bottle of champagne, late check out, chocolates and cookies. Though the gesture was nice they again failed to deliver the items on the agreed time. We wasted 2 hours waiting for them. But we gave up complaining.
We tried Adrift for breakfast on the 2nd day morning. I recommend rise unless you can use the club55 members' restaurant.
We didn't go to the casino because our children were with us and we have been there countless times. Definitely prefer casino at RWS.
The sky park was fantastic. You can see the best parts of Singapore from this side. Just try not to be overly annoyed with the crowd. Dusk was simply beautiful!
We went to the pool after breakfast for 2 mornings. It's not the size or the view (nothing much over on this side except the CBD area, Merlin, floating platform, Fullerton hotel...) but simply being able to swim so high up! The sun was so strong but the water cool! Most importantly the children had the most fun time during our stay there. The pool guard and service staff were amazing. Don't ever lose your key card though. Pool is 1.2m deep the whole stretch but do watch your children because a child did drown there before. Floats are not allowed in the main pool except for life vests. Forget about the baby pool! It's too cold and pathetic. To me the infinity pool saved trip.
In the end, check out was smooth and the manager that help me was professional. He offered to give us a late check out the next time round because we didn't use on this time.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-29 13:27:23.628597

This is the second time I have been up to Skypark so was savvy about needing to book online a couple of days ahead. What happened out for all the small print about dress code & children not allowed, dependent on the time of day you visit.
I was sight seeing with parents and a fruit juice arrived quickly but two cappuccinos were forgotten until,we asked about them - by this time the juice was almost finished. It was quiet - weekday about 4.30pm but a bit of rain meat seat covers were put out and bar shuts so inside bar was serving - hence drink delay I believe.
Stupid change in ruling means if you are not hotel guest you have to go back down I the lift to floor 56, to go up one floor to 57 to enter the bar, when you could just walk through a gate manned by a security person. Last time we went they checked our ticket and let us through but this time not - seemed bit ridiculous to me!

When you reach the ticketing counter of Skywalk (its located in basement next to entrance of Tower 1), they do tell you that you can only go to the tip of skywalk and a little around it but cannot enter pool or restaurant areas as that's for residents only.
I appreciate their honesty because a lot of organisations won't tell you that but they are professional so full marks to them.
What they'd not tell you (unless asked) is their is no place to sit, no chairs or tables or covered area except entry and exit.
The reason it is catch 22 is because the views are pretty much same from Flyer or any other High rise building in Singapore and the fact that you can't sit and eat, it means you pay a hefty fee, go through some high handed service professionals, enter, see the view, click a pic and exit in 10 minutes flat.
I won't recommend this to anyone especially if you end up on a day when it could start to drizzle any moment and you have elderly or kids with you who want to sit, absorb in the views and spend sometime.
I would say, go to Singapore flyer, take a Cocktail, Singapore sling, VIP package: Have your own capsule, have your drinks, chat, laugh and enjoy 30 minutes of Singapore views.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-29 13:28:11.222085

Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.
The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges.

The building or 3 towers is just awesome , a real feat of architecture and engineering . The ground floor has two hotel receptions , shops and restaurants & is very busy.

The skypark is at one end and wasn’t that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.

I don’t like heights so was very unnerved by being so high up so had to let my hubby take in the views & take some photos. There is a small cafe selling drinks and a gift shop but there is no where to sit. Clearly they don’t want you to stay up there for for too long. There is a restaurant too but on the day we went it closed at 2 pm

I honestly don’t know how they built this building as it is amazing but don’t expect to see the famous infinity pool as this is only for hotel guests and the skypark is only one end of the top floor so don’t expect to be able to walk around the whole level. The skypark area is surrounded by a tall glass barrier so is safe but you’ve been warned if you don’t like heights think twice, I have never been so scared as I was on this trip.",12-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 13:29:25.711471

This is the exclusive lift that takes you to the top bar. If you go to the viewing platform that's $25 SGD. The difference is there is no bar at the viewing platform, but amazing views. To go to the bar you get your $22 back via food or drink. So we get to the top with $44 SGD credit for the bar. We order the cheapest beer $16 and a Singapore sling $22 and some bar food, burger sliders $28, paying the difference. There are plenty of places to take pictures, there are two bars and you are welcome to go either side or both. There is no entrance to the pool except for guests but from one of the bars you can see the pool in all its Glory. There is not a lot of shade on the patio so take your hat or shade umbrella. Bottle if champagne starts about $130, wine is about the same. A glass or either is $30. We think it gets dearer as you go up each floor! Highly a brilliant experience. The hotel seemed really busy with guests, I am not sure about room size. There seemed to be three towers with loads of guests and lots of check in check out desks scattered around the ground floor. Well worth the experience and easy to get by bus from harbour town with bus 197. Take plenty of cash or coins because you need the correct money for the bus, it cost SGD $2.20 for two. Our day started when we went by taxi from the Marriott Tang Plaza to the sky rail, sky rail gondola costs a bit but we'll worth the ride, caught the sky rail to Sentosa and went to the Merlion, then SeaWorld, then left Sentosa by monorail to Harbour town which is free. This is a big shopping plaza with everything. We crossed the road out the front to go to the bus station to go to the Marina Bay Hotel. We saw the gardens after the Marina Bay Hotel by crossing the bridge, totally amazing.

The views were so nice from the 57th floor I think and the drinks were reasonable for Singapore. $28 cover charge to get in but that included a drink (not a cocktail) when you got up there. We had a couple of cocktails each and think they were around the $25 mark each which didn’t seem bad at all for the setting.

Things to note: do not take your drinks into the pool father then where the wood is. It’s not allowed.

Do not sit on the edge of the pool.

We didn’t do either but saw others get asked to move off the ledge or come in with their drinks.

There was a male/female photographer in the pool who will take photos of you and give you a band to go check them out later. We didn’t mind at first, but she kept having us do super cheesy photos for like 5 minutes that we just weren’t into. We never ended up checking the photos.

We took the MRT to Marina Bay Sands to experience the skylark and lunch. We started with a qwik beer in the lobby bar ( as we were a little early for lunch).. We took the option of a meal for lunch at the Asian fusion restaurant Ce La Vi on the 57th floor a truly spectacular view of Singapore skyline and a lunch that was exceptional yet very expensive. A Pinot noir from New Zealand will set you back about $150AUD and the set menu for $68 was very reasonable. We had king fish for starters, wagyu for mains and the dessert was a chocolate concoction to die for! It did rain a little but that did not have any impact on the view, in fact I think the fact that they closed the bar that was outside the restaurant only enhanced the view.
We then took the MRT to little India for another sensory sensation! If you follow me, you will see where we went next!",06-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 13:31:17.160112

The view is good. But there is limited explanation of what it is you are looking at and there is no seating. We would have liked some detail about the build etc, but the whole experience seems to be about extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of effort.

Are we glad we did it?

Possibly.

Would we do it again?

Definitely not.

There are two ways of visiting the top deck here
First way is to pay to go on the observation deck. For your money you will be able to traverse the whole sky park and have great access to get photos and admire all of the surroundings
The second way is to pay your money to visit the sky bar. The advantage here is that your fee becomes a bar credit. So in effect all you have done is prepaid for a round of cocktails and your sky visit is free!
Downside is roaming space is much more limited than the observation deck and the bar does tend to populated by wannabes which you may find slightly annoying.either way is a winner really. Just in different ways",03-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 13:32:47.760378

We purchased the Sling option with our ascent price. Having experienced the real gin thing (at an eye watering price) in the Raffles Long Bar the day before, receiving a frozen pink sludge in a plastic cup atop the tower did not do justice to the location.

We could have purchased an expensive meal in the roof top restaurant and bar, but we chose not to do that. With hindsight, that would have been the better memory.

There is a dress code. No open toe sandals or shorts for the guys. Or, you can pay an entrance fee and go to the public viewing gallery. When I was visuting, you could also book a table at Spago. They also have almost 360 views. Don’t miss looking at the other side away from city as you can get great photos of the South China Sea and the sunsets.

,1,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,645859417,15-01-2019,4,Beat the Cost,"I can’t swallow paying S$20 a head to see the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. It just galls me to think of it. I do understand why Marina Bay Sands would charge a hefty sum; if they didn’t every visitor to town would head up there, perhaps multiple times. I also understand why drinks with that view are high-priced; they’re also high-priced at Bangkok’s SkyBar, which has a comparable view. Singapore, like many other port cities, affords some terrific views, if only you get high enough. But in Sydney you can get a thrilling view simply by walking halfway across the Harbour Bridge, for free. In Valparaiso you can get one simply by going up one of the cerros for free (Concepcion comes to mind); in San Francisco, by going up one of the hills for free (Telegraph comes to mind). And more to the point, you can get views of Singapore and the straits (and Sumatra on a clear day) from Mount Faber or vantage points on the Southern Ridges walk, for free. I will grant you that Marina Sands has a spectacular infinity pool up there, (though non-guests can’t use it) and a virtual monopoly on views of the Marina Bay and downtown, looking north. Probably not a bad place to be during Formula One either, if you’ve got a telescope. However, if you absolutely must get up to that roof and see that view, I have two recommendations for a more cost-savings approach:

Plan A: Book a room at the Marina Bay Sands, for heaven’s sake! If not for your entire stay, just book for your first night or two. Let’s say you and your significant other are travelling together. Book in, unpack, and immediately head up to catch that view. Head up again at sunset, and later at night for fireworks or star-gazing. The next morning head up bright and early to catch the view at dawn, and then head up again in the afternoon to take a swim. The view from the edge of the infinity pool is pretty awesome, which is why you often see “swimmers” lined up along the north edge of the pool (see Infinity Pool photo). Right, then head up again in the late afternoon to catch the sunset. And head back up a few hours later to catch the late-night view with the lights of Singapore spread out below you and/or a fireworks show. The next morning, you can head up one more time to catch a sunrise, and again after breakfast, just before you check out. Let’s see now: $20 a head for tickets … there’s 2 of you … you both went up 9 times … you just saved S$360 compared to doing all that if you weren’t a hotel guest! Apply that S$360 as an offset to the cost of the room! Plus, the view from inside your room is likely to be quite fine too, and you can look out your window without suffering claustrophobia from the crowd, so it’s considerably more romantic (see View from Room photo).

Plan B: Tell a friend of yours how incredible the view is, and talk him or her into booking themselves a room at the Sands. Then, as soon as they book in, meet them in the lobby and ask to borrow their card for a quarter-hour. Cost to you: not a single blessed thing. Well, OK, maybe a friendship. But hey, at least you got the view absolutely free!",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 13:35:03.295690

The bar was naturally very busy, great music, good vibe - we managed to find a table around the bar area, ordered drinks and watched the sun go down. The ticket for the lift is then used to buy a drink (all drinks are the price of the ticket or more - I would say not as expensive as the drinks at Raffles!).

The views from there are spectacular. There are also nice views on the opposite side, from the hot tubs. The pool water can be cold once the sun goes down, but feels really good when sunny. However, at night, you get a decent view of the nightly light show by the bay. Don't forget to take your token selfie at the pool!

There are also 2 restaurants up there- Lavo and Spago. Lavo was not really my taste, but Spago offered a good breakfast. We wanted to go for dinner, but never made it.

You can also pay to go to the observation deck, but we never did that since we were staying at the hotel. At night, there is a club up there, which seemed quite popular. We didn't go because that's not really our thing.

The drinks took ages to come and the snacks didn’t appear. We had finished our drinks and were trying to pay (we gave up on the snacks) and they almost insisted we stay and wait for the snacks !

Let's start with the basics. The Skypark is the boat shaped structure located on top of the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. There are 3 ways to get to it. The priciest way is to stay at the Sands. When we looked at room prices, they were $600 and up. But that gets you access to all of the Skypark, including the infinity pool. You cannot get to the infinity pool as a non-guest. The second option is accessed from INSIDE the Sands Hotel. Just inside the door on Tower 3, there is a desk and usually a long line. This line takes you to the Skypark BAR. The ticket (not sure where to purchase - ask) costs around $20 but is taken off your tab at the bar. Now, it won't buy you a lot as a draft beer is around $20. But, you do get to go to the highest point, one floor higher than the observation deck. That being said, the bar is relatively small. Seating is limited. Your view is therefore somewhat limited. You cannot get from the Bar to the observation deck or vice-versa without purchasing a second ticket and standing in a second line. The third option is accessed from OUTSIDE Tower 3. Around the corner of Tower 3 is a glass enclosure with steps that descend to a ticket counter. For a similar ~ $20, you can go up to the next to top floor and access the observation deck. This deck wraps around the front of the ""ship"". It is at least 200 feet long on each side of the ship. That is at least 400 feet of viewing area. When we were there, there was no time limit for your stay on the deck. We went up before sunset, around 6:00, watched the sun set at about 6:30, and stayed until 7:30. Then we went down and got a seat at the Sands Water and Sound show which started at 8:00. It is better to watch the show from ground level than from the observation deck, but you can see it from the observation deck if you wish. You can also see the Gardens by the Bay light and sound show from the observation deck. This occurred at 7:45. Discount tickets to the observation deck can be obtained from some tour operators. In order to get from the observation deck to the light and sound show, you need to descend the elevator at the Sands, go into the sands Tower 3, find the mall entrance, go to the mall, go up 2 floors, walk to the opposite wall, find the large glass doors and exit the mall to the bay side. The light and sound show is held near the ""lotus flower"" which you will recognize. I hope this helps you decide how to see the city from the Skypark and keeps you from standing in the wrong line!

It costs $20 USD to enter (which is cheaper than just the Skypark fee) and includes a free drink (we got an amazing Singapore Sling and Whiskey Sour). It was virtually empty mid-afternoon and we were able to sit, enjoy our drinks and admire an unobstructed view of the entire city.

Screwed up our booking and could not put us on the same floor as couple we were travelling with. Then could not offer our friends a garden view room and tried to pass off the lower grade city view as a ""free upgrade"". Eventually after much arguing both couples has garden view rooms with us on the 39th floor and the other couple in a smaller room on the 22nd floor. No offer of refund or compensation.

Then the problems started! They managed to balls up all our bags and sent our bags to the other couples room and vice versa. That took another hour or so to sort out and when I complained about the service they would not reply to me and only changed the subject.

We decided to meet upstairs and have a drink at a bar up on the Skydeck. Yes this is (an alledged) 5 star hotel and we did expect higher than normal prices what following was just gob smacking. $132 for two bubbly wines and two beers!!! You've got to kidding!!

We also wanted to book into the Italain restaurant that evening but that ws closed for a private function. This must have been the reason they refused to acknowledge or return any of my emails I had sent to book this place months prior to our arrival.

So we decided to just do our own thing ate out away from this ""joint"" at Newton's Circus and Satay Street over the next couple of nights and also taking in Gardens by the Bay and the two magnificent conservatoriums.

Stupidly we used the hotel's concierge to book our transfer back to the airport which included having our luggage picked up from our rooms 15 mins before. no one turned up to collect our bags so we took them down stairs ourselves to meet out transfer. Guess what? The transfer failed to arrive!!

Ended up just grabbing a cab that was dropping someone else off.

We paid $500 a night for a once in a lifetime 5 star experience and all we got was appalling service. BUT MOST ANNOYING AND INSULTING WAS THE COMPLETE LACK OF CARE OR EMPATHY ANYONE SHOWED ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS.

Our advice - look somehwere else - don't bother.

And we are so pleased that we did, this was an awful experience! We decided that since we had never ventured to the newer parts of Marina Bay we would hop down to Sands and have quiet drink whilst taking in the view. What we found was simply awful.

There is a queue for the elevator to go up and you have to pay SGD 20 pp for access. This is then deductible from drinks at the bar. We had 2 glasses of red wine, which came to $80 (that's about USD 50+ for 2 glasses of wine. You also can't access the best views by the edges because all those areas are reserved for hotel guests, as is the pool area; which is actually fair enough because if we had decided to stay here we would have expected nothing less.

The place is crowded and touristy and highly reminiscent of the atmosphere in Vegas and the people it seems to attract are also the same type of people you find in Vegas, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it!! It wasn't for us and we won't be back and certainly won't stay in the hotel in favor of our regular quieter, less crowded more personal and intimate hotels, of which there are many in SIngapore. There are also many other places to have a rooftop drink with great views of the Singapore skyline.

In our estimation, this place is a fad which will wear off and in the meantine represents a noisy, crowded over-priced tourist attraction.

The experience starts with the lifts which zoom you up the 57 stories in no time making your ears pop on the way! Once you reach the top the views of Singapore are extraordinary. From up here you can appreciate what a compact and green city this is. A friend whose been here said you can see Malaysia on a clear day but unfortunately it was hazy the day we went up. My only minor criticism is that there is no shade at the top and it was very hot the day we visited so we were relieved to get back into the air conditioning.

This is truly one of the must do visits for everyone visiting Singapore. The deck on top of the hotel spans the full 3 towers of the iconic hotel and extends, canterlever style, well over the edges.

It is only the western end that is available to the public, with a restaurant, bar and public observation deck. But the views are no less stunning, despite the fact that you can’t access the whole deck.

The city and harbour views are nothing short of breathtaking and you can stay up there as long as you like. Sunset/dusk is a good time to visit, but very busy. You get the daytime views and then watch the city lights all come alive.

Based on my experience at that time there was no queue at all. For the comfort and safety of all guests, they limit the number of people who can enter at any one time. So there were only some visitors are on the deck. That means I can take pictures freely without being distracted by many people who can block the view.

Nonetheless, it is a great experience and the views are very good. The deck is open air, this makes it better for some and worse for others. There are good information boards which help interpret the view.
TOP TIP – Even if you don’t go to the top, make sure that you spend lots of time inside the building, each of the towers is largely hollow and this gives terrific views up the inside, there are also shopping malls and lots of places to eat.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 13:40:00.162096

The Skypark is on the 56th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Just visiting the hotel was interesting in itself, as it well deserves the label of one of the world’s greatest hotels. The sweeping design of the three towers topped with a connecting deck/wing is an inspired design but at around 800 dollars per night for one of the cheapest rooms, this was beyond my means.

You access the Skypark deck via a separate entrance and after the obligatory photo, you take an express lift to the platform itself. It is all very well organised but I can imagine that there could be long queues on really busy days. Stepping out onto the deck makes it all worthwhile, with magnificent views of the sweeping coastline on one side and the dramatic cityscape on the other.

The deck itself gives an unobstructed view on three sides and has been designed with sufficient space for the busiest of days. Clearly, you have to choose the right day for a visit but the views are breath taking and well worth the ticket price. There is a small kiosk selling drinks and ice cream but there were few takers amongst the viewers, who were all captivated by the magnificent views.

There are several ways to reach the Marina bay sands; but the best way is the MRT. It takes you directly to Marina bay sands. Other ways are bus and taxi as always. If you can afford to stay in this hotel; please do. Awesome service and experience luxury. The main attractions for this place is the infinity pool. The rules for pool usage keeps changing from time to time. I suggest call and check. But the swim in the pool is a must. Late afternoons would or early mornings are good times to be in the pool as the heat is not too much. Otherwise also it’s good as it’s quite windy so high up. One can sip cool beverages served in the cafe there. Advice: carry your swim wear to enjoy the pool. Rental swim wear is not available all the time.
The place has a killer shopping area for the Uber rich.
The place has a casino and is the other major attraction. For foreigners there is no entry fees. For locals an entry charge of 100 SGP is needed. Depending on how much you are willing to spend and how addicted to gambling are you; you can spend time there. I suggest entering there at the end of the visit else you will never get out of the casino.
I had never been to a casino before and I spent 3 hrs.
One can spend time on the slot machines if nothing else for the experience.
At the end of the day you can go to the food streets nearby for a nice evening drink by the bay. Enjoy",05-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 13:40:42.092419

The lift tickets are $20 each but they said we could use that fee as credit to buy drinks or food up there. The lift was quick, not crowded at dusk, but did have a big line by the time we came down. We arrived at the top to find out that the areas with the best view are for hotel guests only and we were stuck with a crowded, and often smoky area back from the guests. However the view was brilliant and we eventually found a bar stool and ordered one drink each. After the $40 already paid, we still had to hand over another $15 for taxes etc. $55 for two drinks! If you only go up once it's certainly worth it for the view but I wouldn't go again.

So we went to find desk in lobby which is not signposted but says the name of restaurant/bar. We bought the tickets and went in the lift.at floor 57 you get out and go either left or right. We went left to the lounge area.

You keep your ticket from the elevator because its acts as credit off food and drink from the bar next to the amazing Infinity pool.
The guests at the Marina Bay pay a premium for staying there no doubt and I personally wouldnt want to stay there and have people gawping at you from a bar area next to the pool. Although it has to be said... Many guests simply enjoy the exposure!!
Drinks and food are not cheap here either like most things in Singapore..But you have to remember that you are paying for an experience that is not to be missed whilst you here in Singapore. Of a choice of going to the Raffles or the marina Bay. The Marina Bay Skypark would win every time!! Definitely worth a visit!!",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 13:42:35.134638

A couple of things to note, that the entrance fee (around $SGD23 pp) gets you to the top but not the infinity pool which is only open to guests of the hotel. There is little shelter up on the top so if it is raining, windy or really sunny you should dress accordingly. Also it is quite hazy so if you are looking for a spectacular clear view of the horizon, you'd be best getting a photo off the internet. There is a souvenir shop and ice cream stall and small restaurant. Check opening times for the restaurant as it wasn't open when we went in the morning. Also, it is a hugely popular destination so best to go outside peak times so you can easily wander and enjoy without hoards of tourists taking pictures. Would recommend going twice (if you were prepared to pay the fee twice) as it is amazing looking around the city in the daytime but also with the lights at night it is stunning. Great picture, map and information boards around helping you understand the history of what you are seeing.

There are plenty of eating options either in the hotels or across the road and the pool and Skydeck are mind blowing. What let this down was the hotel part of the Sands. We stayed in a club room which was quite nice and spacious and the bathroom is very nice. In saying that the bed was extremely hard and it hard a stupid auto charge mini bar which meant you could put anything in it. You could request a personal fridge for $10 per night, a little rich for me given how much you pay for the room.

The Club lounge (Club 55) was nice with a good selection of food due afternoon tea, canapes and breakfast. But we received no information about the club services so we got caught out with time, especially the one where after 7pm it turns into a public bar and club inclusions stopped, which meant no supper for me.

I also found the level of service to be lower than I would expect from a hotel of this calibre and cost.

In a tombola trolley. Sadly the contents were strictly average 49$SGD++
About the same price as more established hotels. Even the squirty cream was being passed off with the scones. Clotted cream only way to go. After the chef twice for replacement, no can do was the attitude. White cap chef appeared saying sorryx4!
Duty manager arrived, reduction in our Bill of 49SGD, and out came Cornish clotted cream. They picked an Englishman to test out the squirty cream on!!!
Sadly they were on commission to sell Marina Bay tea, a wild teamaker was doing a jig with a copper kettle.
Before writing this review in February 2018 the Hotel is struggling for customer, they were dropping room prices by 40SGD a night. More expensive generally Than hotels in the Bay Area. Glad to see other reviews experiencing disappointed.

I feel very strong and passionate about good and consistent service and especially one of your unique hotel experiences in Singapore the expectation of the client grows.
we booked a club room to allow use of pool and gardens by the bay cost at $600++ a night why???
Before i commence with the negatives,which i will be making a review later on,i am a fair person and have fair expectations, quite humble and straight approach in life and firstly i would like to point out the positives.Thank you for creating a private members check in service was a delightful way to begin our stay and AI couldn't do enough for us great customer service. the room and the views amazing the decor a little Vegas would have been nicer more traditional Singapore/ Asia style but pleasant enough, lovely bathroom and bath heavenly.
Plenty of choice to eat in or out. A lovely birthday cake surprise thank you.

Now for the negatives and if had only been one or two you probably wouldn't heard from me......
On our first afternoon we checked out the pool top area very full and loud asked to have a table for 2 in the restaurant Spago almost empty shown to a middle table not one with a view why?
Both tea afternoons held at the club room only club55 was nothing short of chaos with seating people and long queues. Sat down cakes a little tasteless and disappointing selection. On both canapes evenings had to wait for the queue to go down and offered champagne on the first evening not offered on second evening. The staff were quite rude and abrupt with our table and as a result i had to keep asking for a drink instead of being offered one.

As you can see as a high paying customer per night per stay i have the right to feel a little let down by this major player hotel. I always thought paying at club level, especially at your hotel, you gained the more stylish and extravagant experience i however feel the club level rooms are over accommodated/ populated and as a result the club has become in your hotel a self serving room as a cruise liner would have adults like herds of sheep whilst the views were breathtaking it doesn't win us over with the mass noise and lack of ambiance in the club 55 room.

We sat Sunday and Monday 7th and 8th January at the window seat side of the gardens at canapes and drinks and the lady staff on these days were rude judgmental and quite frankly snobby. We were one of the few guests who dressed up for these special club 55 dress attire and we were made to feel like we were walked over and tramps.

As you can imagine not a nice feeling and to be ignored or watch the glasses to see if you need another drink or even worse ""you must finish your glass before we get you another one madame"", when your drink is nearly to the bottom is nothing short of offensive.
We paid well over the odds for the privileges and feel we would rather revisit a less busy hotel on our return to Singapore as our previous 2 night stay was in another field of class and treated the customer as if they were the only customer in the room.
We always wondered what it would be like to be on a cruise ship i think we can tick this off our bucket list now after staying at the Marina Bay Sands probably Las Vegas too. Shame this hotel is not about class as quantity will never make up for quality.

I feel your staff could improve the chaos in the club 55 with time slots for afternoon teas/ Canapes or hold them in 2 different settings so noise ambiance can be spread and staff as well as the guests could enjoy this together.

As i stated earlier in my email i care about good service, standards and feel more could be improved on and hope The Marina Bay Sands continues to drive the success further and higher than we experienced.

One day we could be special V.I.P.s and then a top critic could be writing a serious article on the downsides of big hotels. I am hoping this is not the norm for most people and we have been a little unlucky with staff/ timings.

Believe me we found nicer better and far more luxurious accommodation in Singapore and so thankful for all they did for us as it made up for the lack of care and concern from the ,Marina Bay Sands.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 13:45:03.614870

Unfortunately unless you are staying at the hotel you can’t get to the top floor where the restaurant and Infinity pool are.( apparently guess complained as it got too busy). But you can get to the floor below which you can walk around. The lift up is very fast but you can’t feel it move at all. Once you have had enough of the view you can go downstairs and walk through the high end shopping malls. It is beautiful done. The six billion it cost has been recouped by the American casino company that owns it in 3years so we didn’t bother going there to give them more money. It’s well worth a visit.,11-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:45:53.336063

Our plan was to go to the top to admire the view. It turned out that the Sky Bar was in Tower 3 and there was a long queue of people waiting to buy tickets to go up to the top.

With tickets in hand, we caught the lift to level 57. Our red tickets qualified us for entry to the bar on the deck overlooking the city. If we'd gone for the cheaper white tickets we would have been able to go onto the outer observation desk to get a better view.

Wine in the bar area was pretty pricey. We paid $27 for each glass of a McLaren Vale red wine. However we got a $20 credit on each glass for our red tickets. What they often don't tell you as that they then add on tax and a service charge.

As we sipped on our wine, the sun set gradually over the tall city buildings lighting up the clouds with an attractive pink glow. It wasn't easy to take photos because the bar area was so crowded.",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:45:53.882892

When we got to the top there is a stand where you can view your pics and if you like them you have the option of purchasing them. The staff there presented them 8n a nice folder and we were shocked when he told us it will be $60.00 Singapore dollars (which for Aussie the exchange rate at the moment is almost 1:1)... When we said no thanks he said the pics only will be $30.00 ... We still think it was too much for 2 doctored photos and walked away, feeling slightly miffed at the inflated tourist prices.

The view was breathtaking. Please note that the viewing platform is not covered and if it rains, there is very minimal shelter for visitors on the deck itself. We got rained on but watched spectacular lightning storm cowering in a all corner of the souvenir stand.

You might see stairs that lead to a bar... However the bar and infinity pool(7th floor) is only available to hotel guests.

It was extremely crowded and queue management seemed pretty much non-existent. And buying tickets in advance doesn't get you by 95% of the line. So after a wait of over half an hour we were on top. Pleasingly one of the reasons for the long line to get up is that they limit the number of people on top to quite a small number so it didn't feel congested at all. And the views by night are certainly spectacular. We were there at 8.00 and could see the laser show down in the bay from on-high and we then went down to ground level to see the 9 o'clock show which worked out well. The whole Marina Bay sands (and the quite astonishing swimming pool, viewing platform etc on top) are an amazing piece of engineering.

Food portions are not enough to feed a child.
Their service is automatically charged in the bill as 10%, and it is not deserved.
The staff and the managers do not care about the tourists (especially the western tourists) as the tourists are not their permanent customers.
The night ended resorting to the room-service in our own hotel as we returned hungry.

Tower three is the cheap room tower, the check in is horrible and the skypark tourists are the lowest of the low, the lift is quick but the end result is very disappointing.

This dropped a bit by the time we headed back down, but it still took almost 40 minutes to make it to the elevator. There is also no ability to see the infinity pool from this area.
Note that you are also not allowed to set up a tripod, so forget about getting a stunning photograph at night. You can watch the Marina Bay Sands light show from this vantage point, but you cannot see all the images, so I think it is best viewed at ground level.

The whole building is very impressive and due to its spectacular design a gem of the city.

Absolutely a must visit !

We went into the building and headed for the elevators. We waited for one of the hotel's guests to enter, in order for him to activate the elevator with his card, and selected to go to the rooftop - in this way you can see the rooftop on your own without booking a tour, as that is not necessary.

The views have the wauw-factor and you can enjoy those for a long time. You see a big part of the city and its stunning structures and the harbor as well.

There is a bar for the general public up there which opened at 11 am. and we went there to queue in order to be among the first to enter - and we succeeded.

We were able to be seated just at the wall to the pool area and had a great view. There is a ""must-buy"" policy if you sit down but it is still cheaper than going with any tour.

Views were great and the lift was so fast! They make you take a gimmicky photo against a green screen before going up and then try and charge and arm and a leg for it after superimposing the marina sands bay in the background.

Now the bad bits about my experience.

TIp
I arrived by underground There are two stops at the end of the line one called Bayfront and one called Bay Sands. Who'd have thought the stop called Bay Sands isn't actually The Bays Sands Hotel stop but is actually half a mile walk away. You actually need the Bayfront stop which the hotel sits on (der).

Now this is my real disappoint.
I booked this hotel in April having seen it on TV and always wanted to see the F1 night race in Singapore(which is in September) so thought lets go for it. I rang the hotel and asked before I booked what the best rooms for viewing the Grand Prix were. I was told to make sure you book a deluxe with view. I think it was about £50 more than a normal room. What's an extra £50 quid when your already paying £600 for a room anyway, Its all about the view hey.
About 5 days before I parted the UK I get an email from the hotel saying if I want a proper view of the race I need to pay an extra $100 for the pleasure. after a lot of emails they agree to not charge me and give me the room I thought id booked with a view of the race.
So I arrive at the hotel get the keys to the room and cant wait to see this view. As I enter the room the curtains are closed but are automatically triggered to open and reveal the view. What a view, trouble is its a great view of the bay but you can hardly see the track. Its like being at a pop concert and your so far back from the stage it could be any one on stage. The only way you know it who you thing it is, is because you recognize the music. You can just about see cars going around but no chance of recognizing who is driving them. How dare they try charge you extra for this.

In conclusion It you want to stay in one of the best hotels in the world this has got to be up there with the best, with the views of the bay infinity pool etc. Don't book this hotel though if you hope to see the F1 race from your room. There are much better hotels that are in the track itself.

We bought tickets from the underground ticket office (physically distinct from the hotel lobby at the ""bow"" end of the Skypark structure) and were told they were for the observation deck only and that the infinity pool and gardens were for hotel guests only. There was no mention of options for access to the bar. I'm guessing the person who said they got into the bar for free must have used the hotel elevator as the Sky Park elevator only has a stop at Level 56 (the observation deck). You can walk up stairs to the level of the bar and a little beyond it but I didn't take note of any signs regarding access to the bar from that point. There is as noted elsewhere, a snack bar on the observation deck but no seating. There are signs saying sitting on the deck is not allowed but more than a few visitors seemed to ignore those.

Overall, whilst the daytime views are undoubtedly spectacular, it did feel like you were tolerated up there rather than welcomed notwithstanding the admission charge and the segregation from hotel guests was clear.

I should add we were asked when buying the tickets if we'd flown with Singapore Airlines, and on providing proof we had, a 15% discount was applied. Don't know if that applies to any other airlines generally or at least in the Star Alliance. Worth asking when buying.",09-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:47:54.265567

Check in was at the reception at Tower One and room was only available after 2 pm
Room was on the 31st floor on Tower 3.

If you have a choice , please ask for a room on a floor higher than the 34th level.
Not all the lifts on Tower 3 would take guests to the top floor on 57th level.
Certain lifts only go up to the 34th floor and then the guests have to walk to the other lifts that would take them to the 57th floor.

Our room faced the Garden by the Sea and it was fairly spacious for a 5 stars hotel.
Loved the automated window curtains in the room.

Room was clean and well maintained by the staff especially Li Bing who went out of his way to accommodate us in doing an extra cleaning of the room due to a small mishap.
Many thanks to Li Bing , hotel staff member , for cleaning our room beyond my expectations. Well done ! Li Bing

The views from the Swimming pool on the 57th floor was worth the money . Access to the swimming pool and the observation deck are only gained by room cards.
Daytime and nighttime views from the top floor are very much different.
It is my opinion that 30% of our hotel cost is based on these fantastic views of the Singapore city lights and buildings

A brief quick walk around the hotel casino and like many casinos that I have seen , this casino is no different. Boring flashing and spinning neon lights do not excited me.

Food at the hotel restaurants is expensive and the food court on the other end of the building is also expensive. Instead we took the subway MRT train to the next station Bugis on the Downtown Blue line for dinner .

Overall it was an expensive experience but it is worth the money spent.",08-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:48:08.957602

Just as the hotel itself is reminiscent, and on the scale of the huge structures of Las Vegas, so was the walk to it. It was that strange feeling like being a Lilliputian in Gulliver’s Travels. You keep walking, but don’t seem to get any closer,because you haven't recognized the scale of your surroundings.

Anyway, it was quite a trek to the hotel, which is not just a hotel, but a resort with a shopping mall as well. We eventually found the location within this giant structure at which we could buy tickets for our elevator ride to the 57th floor SkyPark Observation Deck. We paid our SD23, but then had to wait in line for some time before it was our turn to ride to the top.

The Observation Deck was a busy place with hordes of tourists taking in the 360 degree view, buying snacks or sitting in the bar/restaurant. At the mid-late afternoon time of our visit it was certainly more crowded than we would have liked, but that didn’t detract from the spectacular view over Singapore, the bay and the sea. It was interesting trying to pick out places we had been and identify others. We probably spent an hour up there, and that was enough for us. We didn’t access other parts of the Skydeck with the infinity pool and other bars, restaurants and palm trees. If we’d had more time, it might have been good to include these and make an afternoon/evening of it.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:49:07.209458

If you are just going to the observation deck you will find the entrance outside, go the the glass doors and down the escalator. If you are going to go up for lunch you will find the entrance in the lobby.

Once your ticket is purchased you will be pointed to the right direction, but before you get on the elevator you will be asked to pose for a photo against a green screen, once you reach the Sky Park your photo has been printed and is ready for purchase, the photos (2) looked nice but at $55.00 SGD I decided to pass.

You only have access to the very front of the deck but that is enough to see everything you want to view anyway. There is some glass but there are openings with steel strands that are far enough apart to point your camera through.

It appears you can stay there as long as you wish but I was there during the day and there weren't many people there, maybe there is a different policy at night when I would imagine there would be more people.

When you are done head over to the opposite side from which you entered and you will find the elevator going down.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 13:49:45.406385

We were lucky to go there on a fine and settled, with no wind and had a drink in the bar after soaking up the fantastic views of the area.
Worth bearing in mind that once you leave the main viewing area and enter the restaurant part, there is no return, so you must stay in that part prior to your trip back to ground level.

The public can also go up with tickets purchased at $23 for adults. So it's a must to visit if you are a guest. Go early or before closing if you want a dip because it's less crowded. Admission will be on hold if there's too big a crowd already inside the open deck pool area. There are group tourists who just go up to catch a view of the infinity pool, city view and Gardens by the Bay at the observation deck.

It seems you can’t go from the open deck to the bar area without going back down and buying a separate ticket. (Seems a bit silly). We didn’t pre-purchase tickets on-line – just turned up during a weekday, when there were fewer people. The views are truly amazing. Because we lingered here for a long while to take it all in (and to take lots of photos) we’re glad we chose to do this instead of the Flyer. Be aware that the area is completely open ie there is no shelter from rain or the intense sun. No seating either. Were it not for being corralled into a seemingly obligatory photo shoot at the level 3 lift, then being pounced upon to buy a particularly expensive photo pack when alighting from the lift at the top (polite staff simply doing their job), we would have given this attraction an “Excellent” rating.",03-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:51:39.525968

The cost is $23 (Singapore) which I think is reasonable and getting to the entrance in tower three is fairly straightforward and well sign posted.
Once there you are then coralled into the mandatory photo booth which I find rather annoying and I would assume queue generating at busy times, though apart from a money maker may serve to control the movement of people to the lifts.
The lifts themselves are speedy taking only a matter of seconds to ascend to the 57th floor where you are already greeted by the friendly eager staff wanting to sell the photos taken only minutes earlier.
Once outside there is a largish U shaped deck area allowing fantastic panoramic views of three sides of the city and that really is the only positive I can report.
You will find a souvenir shop selling drinks and snacks but there is no free seating and despite signs asking you not to sit on the floor you don't really have a choice unless you choose to visit the ridiculously expensive bar upstairs which having done so you are then forced to exit by descending one floor to re-enter the Skypark?
So to sum up, if you want spectacular views this is for you, if you want more you may be disappointed.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:51:47.366795

The view was magnificent, over all of the city, and far out to sea. There's a huge infinity pool up there too, but only open to hotel residents. We had lunch, which wasn't over-priced, and the service was good. I was surprised to see the number of large ships just off Singapore, I counted over 100, plus many smaller ones. It shows what a financially successful place Singapore is. So - if you like good views, and are prepared to shell out a bit over £10, take the lift up to the roof of this extraordinary hotel. The hotel itself is pretty amazing, constructed of three huge towers, each shaped like a pair of playing cards propped up against each other (apparently that was the architect's inspiration), with what looks like a ship perched on top! The towers are hollow, with the hotel rooms attached to the inside of the walls. (The Luxor hotel in Las Vegas, modelled on a giant pyramid, is the same). There are restaurants, luxury boutiques, a high walkway across from the Gardens by the Bay, and deeper in the shopping complex (which they call ""The Shoppes""), a canal with sampans you look down on from on high. So well worth a visit, and maybe even a night's stay, to use the infinity pool, but a quick online check shows that would be £300+ per night.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:51:47.933251

Admission was quite expensive (S$32 with a 20% discount coupon or seniors card); but on reaching the observation deck, we were annoyed to find that the area accessible to visitors is quite small, has very little shade shade and no seating. Visitor tickets do not give access to the real Skypark, with trees etc., that can be glimpsed from the ground. There are signs requesting visitors not to sit on the floor of the deck, but on a typically hot Singapore afternoon, some visitors who had found a bit of shade chose to ignore them. The views are expansive, but if you are hoping to capture great photographs of distant parts of the island or of the huge flotilla of ships anchored offshore, you will probably be disappointed. Singapore's moist atmosphere often makes good distance photography problematic. Having said that, it is a great place to get an overview photograph of the nearby Gardens by the Bay. For those who dislike intrusiveness, be prepared to have an unsolicited photograph taken in the lift foyer. Two prints with different backgrounds will then offered to you for an exorbitant price on your return to the lift. My advice is to visit the observation deck in the evening as part of a Singapore Night Tour. The odds are that it would be far more comfortable and the lights of Singapore would be impressive. I have seen 3.5-hour night tours advertised for around S$65 - S$70. These generally take in the Skypark's observation deck, the evening light and sound show at the Gardens by the Bay and a 20-minute cruise on the river.

On one side is the Oceanic view. On the second side is the merger of Singapore river into the Ocean along with two roads flowing at the bottom. And on the third side is the mesmerizing factoring of the skyline of commercial building nestling the Singapore river Bay.

Evening is the best time to visit this place. Just before the sunset you shall benefit the two worlds,namely, the view under the fading sunlight and the view of the man made exuberance that glitters as sparkling lights.

There is a restaurant , we think it may be available to non-hotel guests but we did not want a meal so did not try to get in. There is a snack bar and small souvenir section. For Singapore, the prices at the snack bar were not expensive considering the surroundings.

However we were interested in the architecture of the hotel with the design of a ship on top. We decided to pay the $40 Singapore dollars to visit the top - as we were waiting someone takes your photo which we thought was a security procedure. However when you get out at the 56th floor you are assailed by a guy wanting $70 Singapore dollars for two photos - a complete ripoff. In fact the experience is not really worth it as the deck area contains no greenery although the views are great but in the heat of the day a bit misty.

The SkyPark's observation deck is soaring to 57 levels from the ground, and the hotel's swimming pool on its ship-shaped roof top is breathtaking. You don't have to be the hotel's guests to go up to the SkyPark and view the swimming pool. There is an easy way to travel to Marian Bay Sands Hotel by comfortable Bus 106 from Orchard Road at the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore. Bus ride takes about 15 minutes and bus frequency is about 12 minutes. Singapore's smart transit card EZ-Link can be used for the ride with one way adult fare of about US$ 0.70. Cash adult fare is about US$ 1.00. [Minors, students, and seniors pay discounted fares]: (1) Direction by Bus 106: Go to the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore (100 Orchard Road). Take Bus 106. After about 10 minutes, look outside carefully. When the bus crosses over a bridge with bay water below, get ready to get off the bus. Once the bus stops, get off the bus (This is Marina Bay Sands stop). (2) Walk back the way your bus has just come (along BayFront Avenue) until you come to the entrance to the hotel's Tower 3 on the right hand side. Before entering Tower 3, look for a separate structure in front of the Tower 3 entrance, and enter this structure instead of entering Tower 3 entrance. --> Go down to the lower level by escalator to the ticket counter area. The SkyPark visiting hours are 9.30 am~10.00 Pm on M~Th and 9.30 am~11.00 Pm on F~S. The adult admission ticket is S$ 23.00, and discount tickets are available for Seniors, Students and minors. (3) Before buying tickets, look at the observation deck tour schedule board on the wall, or ask the ticket agents the nearest tour time which includes free visit to the roof top swimming pool. Then, buy ticket(s) for the tour that includes free visit to the swimming pool area. If you have to wait for long for the next tour which includes the swimming pool visit, you can still buy the ticket, and then go inside Tower 3 for a visit to the lower level restaurant/casino/shop complex until 30 minutes before the tour time. Then, return to the tour ticket counter area for your tour at least 5 minutes before the tour time. (4) At your tour time, you will be asked to go through the usual photo session before being allowed to go up to the observation deck. At the observation deck, a tour guide will let you have a free time to enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore city and harbor before assembling at the designated location for your free tour of the rooftop swimming pool area. You will then have a brief visit to the swimming pool area. Then, you can go down to the photo session area, where you will be asked to buy expensive portraits of yourself and companions with SkyPark background screen. Your tour ends then. (5) You can go back to Orchard Road by Bus 106, or you can spend more time at the lower levels of Tower 3, where there are numerous shops, restaurants, various attractions, and a casino. This visit is strongly recommended. [To visit the casino, you need to show your passport: There are separate entrances to the casino for locals and foreign passport holders. They will all end up being in the same casino after passing through the gate control sections. The only difference is: Locals have to pay admission charge, whereas foreigners don't pay admission charge] (6) To return to Orchard Road by public transportation, you have 2 choices. You can use MRT or Bus 106. MRT station is accessible from the lower level of the hotel. To ride Bus 106 back to Orchard Road, you will go to the opposite side of the bus stop where you got off before. This bus stop can be reached via the passage ways at the lower level. You can ask any attendants there for assistance. (7) Bus 106: You can board Bus 106, and get off at ""Winsland Hse"" stop on Penang Road which is parallel to Orchard Road. This bus stop is about one block away from where you boarded Bus 106 to go to Marian Bay Sands Hotel.",03-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 13:53:55.947758

As far as observation decks go, it ticks all the boxes, amazing views, plenty of places to take pictures and a bar to by a drink.

What lets this place down somewhat is that as soon as you get to the top level, you discover you will need to wait in a 40 minute line to get back down again, which puts a dampner on things somewhat.

During said 40 minute wait, people were pushing in lines, leading to arguments between people and the whole thing just wasn't very pleasant.

We, foolishly in hindsight went here on a Saturday night, I'm sure there are much quieter times to go when it's not as busy.

Anyway, no question Marina Bay Sands is an amazing area with lots to do, I'd probably just pick my time to go to the observation deck better next time.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 13:54:04.549678

The Observation deck appears to us to offer far more space and perimeter 'on the edge' viewing than the restaurant.
You cannot go to the restaurant deck ( or visa versa) so I cant say from personal experience this is absolutely true.

It was a cloudy pre sunset evening when we went up therefore clear distant views were not to be and neither was there a spectacular sunset but the gradual dusk to night views over the City, Gardens by the Bay, Harbour etc made up for it.

The Sands water and light show is not effective from the deck so would be best to leave the deck and go down to see it ( left of the Louis Vuitton Building).

The Light -Sound show at the Supergrove Trees was less of a disappointment but again probably much better in the Gardens.

There is a fantastic view of the city and surrounding area when you get up there ,well worth a visit in my opinion.

We went up at dusk to have enough light to take some pics before the sun went down and then capture the city skyline and the laser show when it got dark.

What we loved:
• the view of the city was unparalleled, we saw out to the shipping lanes and past then Singaporean border
• a birds eye view of some of the spectacular Singaporean architecture
• helpful directional signage that told you what you were looking at and photographing
• amazing iced coffee, frozen drinks and 15$S frozen Singapore Slings

What we didn't love:
• the excruciatingly overpriced fake tourist photos - look, I love the tacky tourist photo more than most... but $90S for two photos that were taken in front of a green screen...?
• nowhere to sit and no shade... Singapore is hot, right? So on a really exposed activity like this you would expect some seating to enjoy your drink or enjoy the view... there is no seating and no shade UNLESS you go to the extremely overpriced bar and restaurant which had a dress code and you need a reservation for
• the ticket says valid till 11pm but... it's one entry only, so we left thinking ""we'll come back later tonight to wavy the Super Tree lazer lights..."" we got to the gate and we're told ""valid for one entry only"" this needs to be made clear at ticketing as many places allow repeat entry, and with tickets worded like that....
• NO access to the pools, bar or restaurant. There is no ticket or pass that gets you into the pools - it's for guests only. I get it, but if they had more inclusive entry at a higher rate that had access to a pool and pool bar, I would have done that in a heart beat. The bar and restaurant require a reservation and have a dress code. Tickets to the Skydeck DO NOT get you into them automatically

There's no seating area, and some people sit on the wooden floor to rest or hide in the shades.

At the top you can have as long as you like taking pics and absorbing the view. Realistically you only want about 20 mins as nowhere to sit.

Very disappointed not to have been able to have had a glass of wine or a cocktail as the restaurant and bar is restricted to hotel guests only.

You then end up queuing for over 20 minutes to get down as they are holding the lifts and filling them at the bottom.

On the plus side, the night views of the city and the Gardens by the Way were spectacular. I wish we could have gone earlier to see the views during the day as well. Also note that there are no ins and outs. So once you get up to the top, there's no going back after you leave. On the negative side, we were really hoping to be able to check out the rest of the massive deck, as well as the pool they have there. Unfortunately, paying for the Skypark only gets you access to the front portion of the deck. I guess maybe only hotel guests are allowed access to those areas. The price isn't bad (S$23, so about $17USD per person) and to me, well worth the price. They have a small snack bar and souvenir stand as well in case you get hungry or want things to bring home. Also keep this in mind. There were only two entrances to the hotel, one on each end, so if you're wanting to get to the Skypark quickly, you'll want to go to the building on the most northerly end (From the main street between the convention center and hotel, this will be the one on the left).",11-2016,Couples,2020-01-29 13:57:16.549748

The prices in their display window are staggering! This is the hotel's shopping area, for it is indeed a hotel.

At the end of this Alladin's Cave of excess is the access to the observation deck of Marina Bay's Skypark on level 56 of this extraordinary building. Warning, the observation deck is NOT suitable for anyone who suffers from vertigo or acrophobia. Also be sure to bring a hat. You are just about on the Equator and the sun up here is brain frying. A bottle of water is also recommended as is a good quality camera, not just a smartphone because the views are spectacular.

Firstly while I understand the need for photo sales it is a bit disconcerting to say no but find yourself buying one just to stop being hassled before even getting into the lift. The other is that you are only granted access to level 56 and so not actually to the top where the palm trees and the guest pool are situated. I respect the rights of guests to have their privacy but I wonder if people realise that this area and the lovely bar that you can access from level 56 is actually off limits. Nevertheless it only costs $23 SGD to take the walk around the level 56 platform and the breathtaking views are worth every cent. We chose to go during the day but I can imagine how visually captivating that view would be at night time overlooking the city lights.

Service was amazing, and Club 55 access came with room which was what made it worth the price as Buffett breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés service (and flowing alcohol which is way expensive in Singapore) was all included.
Only went for breakfast and canapés but sure that the a/tea would have been magnificent too.

I think it's a tad expensive at $23 SG equals $23.15 AU just for a elevator ride and a lookout but it is what it is. Before entering the elevator a photograph is taken of you or your group which you are able to purchase before leaving. Very pricey though with the basic cardboard cover photo at $35 SG and 2 other offers even more expensive. Look the view is amazing and wow you do not realise how many ships are anchored until you see them from the air. There is a kiosk with refreshments & snacks to purchase and a bar as well but l'm not sure if you can just walk in or if you have to be a guest of the hotel. If you are lucky enough to view the light show which is on every night of the week it's great. I was at the Fairmont Hotel opposite and got a perfect view every night if l was in my room. I noticed it was on twice during the 8.30 to 9.30 timeslot. It goes for about 5 minutes or so and the lasers constantly change colours Regardless check it out a must do attraction see my photos.

My brother has also stayed there months before we visited and he said as a hotel guest with access to the pool it is fantastic. If you do go at night to go to the bar I would recommend wearing smart casual clothing as they have a bit of a dress code for the bar (e.g. no thongs etc).

Just to see it is spectacular and overwhelming. Inside on the ground it is luxurious, spacious ultra modern. The shops, restaurants and bars are first class, We went to the roof top bar, cocktails and beer first class, adjacent to the infinity pool and even though we could not access it (house guests only) it is amazing. The views over Singapore give one a feeling of how big this building is. The downside of this floor is that you can only see the city side of Singapore but that does not detract from the ambience and overall experience. You can pay to go to the Garden Level but the no entry fee for the top level, the reasonable cost of drinks and food plus the atmosphere of the roof is in our opinion a better option.
After visiting or staying or eating or drinking, it is a must to go back to the gardens at ground level and up close for the evening light show - do not miss.
Do not go to Singapore without visiting the absolutely spectacular Marina Bay Sands Skypark. You will not have any difficulty finding it as it stands out like the proverbial dog's hind leg.

The views are fantastic, and we really enjoyed watching Wonder Full from here, it’s awesome.
But management and staff have serious attitude problems towards their guests. Yes there are nice clean toilets, but you cannot sit down at all during your visit. At 67 I am in pain if I stand for an extended period so this is a major problem. In the end I had to sit on the decking, but the security guy ordered us to stand (sitting anywhere is not allowed for safety reasons). My wife strongly protested, and he did then give us a lot of help, but I suspect he broke the rules to do so.
I urge the manager to visit Ion Sky. It’s free, and yes they do provide ample seats. People use them, and do not abuse the facility.

There is what I would call a very tacky souvenir and refreshment shop with high prices to complement hight of the sky deck . Considering this is supposed to be part of a first class hotel I found it disappointing.

It seems the viewing area is very much for the hoi polloi and the entrance is outside of the hotel, although you do exit into the very end of the extensive hotel lobby area. They take your photo in front a blank screen at the bottom of the lift and by the time you get to the top and step out they have printed off a large photo showing you in front of the hotel lit by day or night which they try to sell you at around £25 - we didn't buy, although it was a good pic.

You have access to the viewing deck only with the skypark ticket, great views from the top but nowhere to sit and take in the views and you cannot access the restaurant - for residents only - no doubt to keep your time up there limited, once you had bought a few trinkets from the gift shop up there, not ideal for those with limited mobility either.

Disappointing, because it is an amazing building, but perhaps easier to appreciate off it than on it, unless you are actually staying in the hotel and have full access to the roof top.

You can't also beat the spectacular view of Singapore or the Gardens by the Bay right there in your own balcony or at the Skypark. Most of all, the 3-tower grand structure with its boat-shaped Skypark is a mathematical/engineering wonder in itself.

The Gardens by the Bay is just steps away from the hotel and MBS is a shopping mecca, complete with dining options. Did not try the Casino, but it's there if it's your fancy.

The downside, if you could call it, is its lack of personal touch from the front desk/concierge due to the long line of guests, either checking in or out. Express check out, though, was convenient. The lobby is also full of tourists.

Oh, and to add insult to injury... they keep the adjacent restaurant sectioned off for guests only. Because you’re not really a guest and god forbid you try to spend your poor-person money at their fancy restaurant.

We got there at 7 and a lot of the crowd left around 830 after the light show at marina bay. The area we sat in closed at 10 so everyone had to move to the other bar on right which was packed.

I went up on my own so didn’t feel it was too expensive but I appreciate it starts getting pricey if whole family go.

Not too busy despite going at sunset time and no long queues for lifts in either direction.

Great views as you’d expect and hoot to get another perspective on the various light shows. I saw the Supergrove Trees show and the Spectra show whilst up there. Great to look down on Singapore Flyer too.

I arrived on the downtown subway line at Harbour Front. Followed signs via the shopping area to Tower 3 and Sky Park. Went out of the hotel where all the flashy cars and people arrive opposite the wall water feature. Turned left and went in the glass building downstairs to the ticket area. You are warned or shown you are only visiting the observation platform and there is no access to the hotel and pool area, which is hardly surprising. I like the fact the staff are clear and informative about what you are paying for. Fair price for what you see at $23 for an adult.

You get offered the customary photo before getting in the lift to the 56 floor. Once up the massive deck allows for views of all the key areas. Glass barriers with open parts and safety wire to get better clear photos surround the deck. The small bar sells soft and alcoholic drinks. I loved my Singapore Sling slush puppy type drink. Not cheap at $15 but when in Rome as they say. Also I spotted snacks like hotdogs cooking. There were a few bar stools but people are always there waiting on their order so not a normal bar to sit at. There is a small souvenir counter too. I got my fridge magnet downstairs on the way back, which was a better shop. :)

The restaurant bar above I think I was told can be entered from here, as well as from downstairs for diners - assuming there is room, but you cannot come back onto the observation deck after. I wasn’t bothered just spent a few hours just before sunset and when the city lit up. Took ridiculous amount of pictures. Worth using a small pocket size tripod for perfect night shots. Busy place of course - I did find it annoying after a while how people sat in groups on the floor near the glass making it hard to get pictures. You should spend a while and move about so everyone can soak up a view and take a few pictures from different aspects. The best one for me was the Singapore flyer and business district views. I came back another day to sample some of the shops and bars here plus the gardens on the ground level. What a place.

I went to the buildng and first found the lift going to the restaurant on top. There was a minimum consumption you have to take, or call it lift fee. They told me that they are in the middle section and that the scenic spot would be the end of the platform with a different entrance. So I went there. I remember the ticket was expensive, a lot more than expected. Going up was easy, there was no queue, of course they want to take photos of you first. Lift up is fast. The visitor platform is really only the end part of the platform, most of it cannot be accessed. The view is great if you like water. So many ships out there and can also see the lading planes into the airport. The other side of the platform is the city view, can see the tall buildings. You can also get a coffee up there. Anyhow, if you walk around the platform you have quickly seen all sides, I wondered if the coffee offer I found first would have been the better choice.

This was nothing special to be honest except the rooftop pool, bar, restaurant and observation deck. The interior of the hotel is very nice, but always busy and you feel a certain lack of privacy (hard to explain) but its never 'your' hotel. Its full of day visitors.

There are 3 towers, I stayed in tower 2 which had 6 lifts but there was always a queue, you usually got in but it did take time. There are 55 floors and the lifts are very quick but obviously they do stop on the way up or down with people getting on and off. Tower 2 is also the way to the observation deck for visitors so maybe that's why it was so busy.

The food was nice. I ate breakfast in Spago and Club 55. There was queue for breakfast at every restaurant serving breakfast the 3 mornings I was there. I went for breakfast at 7.30, hardly rush hour, but still a queue of around 15 people waiting at each restaurant. As I was staying on the club floor I went to Club 55 (No queue) and ate there most of the time. Standing in line to eat is not my idea of fun.

The room was large, including the bathroom with double sinks.

The ONLY REASON I wanted to stay here was the pool and that view. The biggest disappointment by far however was the pool. The prices at the pool area were quite reasonable for Singapore but the pool, although larger than I expected, was a HUGE disappointment. It was freezing cold. The weather during my stay was 29/30 degrees and at lunchtime the pool temperature was 22 degress. I found this to be totally unacceptable and it spoiled my whole experience. I can’t imagine why a 5* Hotel would not have a heated pool unless they don’t want people hanging around up there. It was a very long pool, i’d estimate 7m x 70m yet the most people I counted in there at any one time was 20. There are lots of sun beds, it was never full up there so you could always get a spot but considering all this I’d say 80% of the people up there WERE NOT in the pool. There is a smaller garden area overlooking the gardens by the bay at the rear with 2 semi circlular shaped hot jacuzzis. They are placed up against glass panels so you can sit there with a great view. If you want the view, just pay to visit the observation deck and stay elsewhere.",03-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 14:10:10.103567

I would take advantage of having a drink at sunset at the rooftop bar and rushing to watch the laser show down below shortly after. If you can afford to stay here then the infinity pool looked great. The same goes for shopping; the least expensive stores are likely Rolex and Prada and that should give you an idea of the wealth that this attracts.

I wasn't staying at the hotel so I knew I'd have to buy a ticket and that it would probably be expensive but no big deal. I was super excited to buy a drink and lounge by the pool.

I find out on arrival that the Sky Park doesn't include the pool. UGH. Is there any way to pay to get access to the pool? ""No"". What a pain but oh well. I'll still go up, enjoy a drink & explore the rest.

So I pay the $23 for the elevator ride to the top and a snooty employee stresses that this covers only ONE ride to the top. Whatever, that's fine.

I get up and I'm let out onto a tiny little pavilion (access to less than 10% of the rooftop, no joke). Sure the views are great but that's where it ends. Is this a joke? Why is it called a Park?

At least there's a restaurant. So I walk up and the host asks if I'm staying at the hotel; I tell him no. He says ""I'm sorry ma'am, you had to buy a voucher before coming up if you want to eat here"" (voucher does not include price of food). What? No one told me that or I'd have done it! So I go the staff near the elevator and ask to buy a voucher for the restaurant. ""Not possible, you can only do that on the first floor"". Grrrrrrrr.

Most frustrating and underwhelming experience I had in Singapore. I ended up finally getting my lunch at a lame restaurant in the lobby. Never again.",06-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 14:11:31.396399

How to go
=========
Take a taxi or take MRT and get down at Bayfront station. It is nearest from this station.

Follow the signs and you should reach the ticket centre in 7/10 min (leisurely walk).

When to go
=========
Try to reach when the sun is about to set.
That way, you can enjoy the spectacular view during daytime and then follow it up as the lights come on.
Sit and enjoy as the sun sets and the landscape dynamics change in front of your eyes.
Both the views are amazing and not to be missed.

Secret Tip
=========
There are two entrances (lifts) to the Skypark...
1) For Tourists
2) For a restaurant on top called Kudeta

So, if you want to dine at rooftop or enjoy a drink then...use the restaurant lift ( FREE), have your meal or drink and come back.
No need to buy additonal tickets :)

Excellent place for a romantic dinner or a drink or two with friends..

First was on an unusually bright sunny day where the views stretched into Malaysia. The sights of the city high rise the massive amounts of ships in the harbour, fighter jets and helicopters coming in to land at the airbase was a great sight. The deck gives ample views and definitely worth the trip and it is very easy to get to. During the day we visited passage to and from the tower was slight and really easy. No waiting anywhere and we were surprised there wasn't more people. The glass walled fences with wire strands above made you feel very safe. We decided to come back a couple of days later to take in the dusk. There was cloud cover this day but the blood red sun broke through the clouds and as it set the colour of the lights, the peak hour traffic, the little ferry boat and those ships at anchor just made a spectacular contrast to the daytime visit we had earlier. Even the nearby golf course was lit up like day and we will have to do on our next trip i reckon. Looking down at the Gardens by the Bay and seeing Supertree Grove lit and dancing from above was wonderful. You could spend quite a bit of time up there. However the evening visit was quite a contrast to the day visit earlier. You had to queue for the tickets, queue for the elevator up, queue for the elevator down and then the taxi. Note there are no seats up there. If you want to rest people sprawled out on the deck or up against the glass viewing walls. It was tough to get a position in some of the popular viewing areas. There is a souvenir shop and refreshment stall there as well. If you present your Singapore Airline Boarding Pass or are a Kris Club member you will get 15% off the standard price of $23 per adult. Another very popular tourist attraction that is worth the effort. And don't forget to stroll through the huge atrium of the Marina Bay Resort and the adjoining Marina Bay shops. (bring plenty of cash with you). Note the ""obigatory"" photo they take of you against the green screen after you buy the tickets are offered to you up the top at S$70 a pop plus access to a download site where you download the images (you are registering for future advertising from Marina Bay sands so there is no way around it).

I luckily didn't have to queue at all as I think I was slightly out of season. The elevator up seems to take forever as it's so high up, and once you come out of the elevator the views don't disappoint.

From the back of the skypark you can see the Singapore Straight, Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Island, and even as far as Pulau Batam. From the front, you have all of Marina Bay to admire. It really is spectacular.

Tip - I went to the Skypark at around 6.45pm and had a good wander around and took plenty of photos. Sit and relax until the sun sets - it was the perfect location to watch the sunset behind the Business District. At 8pm you can always watch the Wonderfull Light Show at Marina Bay from the SkyDeck, which is also great.

Make the most of the money you've paid and stay for the sunset and the light show! If you want to watch the lightshow from Marina Bay, there is another show at 9.30pm that you won't miss.",01-2017,Solo,2020-01-29 14:12:10.368751

Being able to see the amazing Infinity Pool so close is both good and bad. Yea, you can say you saw the pool now, but it also hurts to know you can't go and get in unless you are a hotel guest!

Yes, yes, it's interesting to look around and get a misty view of Singapore from a birds eye perspective but otherwise it's a poor experience for the money.
After you pay your dues, you go up to a baron deck with nowhere to sit. I guess they don't want to encourage you to hang around for too long, once you've paid. That's OK. They only allow a little glimpse of the real Skypark because that's for hotel guests only. That's OK, too. I thought at least I order something at the restaurant raised above the observation deck but no, that too is for hotel guests only. If they are worried about people sitting there for hours over a mineral water, that could've been solved with minimum order values and time limits for non hotel guests but I guess they were not interested in entertaining the plebs. Oh wait! There was this crappy souvenir shop with nothing worth buying where you could also buy an overpriced can of drink.
Maybe, the place is a bit more spectacular after dark but I didn't bother to go and find out.
The whole Skypark doesn't actually seem that big from up there. A few trees, a pool, restaurants and whatnot on top of a building. I think it is one of those things which is much more interesting from a distance. It's the allure of what it might be (and isn't).
I suppose it's one of those must see things in Singapore which you tick off, on your list. Or, be a hotel guest...

Its interesting taking photos before and after dusk...I enjoyed it very much.

Plenty of family and tour groups wandering around - they appeared to be having a great time.

After a hot day in Singapore it was cooler on top with a gentle breeze making it just right. Avoid rain periods as there is no shelter outside to keep you dry.

It was expensive and you are only permitted to be on the observation deck and not allowed into the garden or the pool, not even to view them.

The best time to visit is to go 1 hour before sunset (make sure you include enough time due to terrible sale office) and go and see the view during the day and watch the sunset and then the city and gardens in the dark when they light up (in my opinion the best view). There are no seats and signs everywhere not to sit on the deck, but i just sat on the floor and watch the sunset.

There is kiosk selling drinks and snacks as well as a bar, as expected both are expensive, but I bought along my own and had a little picnic whilst the city light up.

Definitely a must do, but don't expect great service.

The entrance fee is around 20 singaporean dollars because I was able to fly with Singaporean airlines. For picture alone, you pay 25 dollars and for picture with frame, 50 dollars. What an expensive picture! I would appreciate more if there were less restaurants so that the people could see more of the infinity pool which I think is the highlight.

The building is easily accessible via public transport as it has its own MRT stop (promenade) with a short walk to the skypark itself. From the ground up you can get a sense of scale and wonder at how 3 identical tall buildings can have a park placed on top of it connecting them.

There's a shopping area at the foot of the building, but the majority of it is a hotel. Whilst you cannot get complete access to the park on the top (this is only for hotel users, so forget any notion of taking a dip in the infinity pool) you still get use of an observation deck. the view from this is pretty impressive, and on hot days (as most are in Singapore) the decking and glass can get very warm, so you might not wish to sit down on it. Its an open air observation deck so may not be ideal when its wet or raining....

There's sadly no chairs to sit down to soak up the view, with a limited drinks store at the top. The observation deck itself is partly closed off only a third of it is usable for non hotel guests you can still see what your missing out and view the park and pool from the deck. One thing to be weary of is that novelty pictures from the top (the ones which they take of you to buy so if you wish) is very expensive, its about £15-35 depending on what type your after....

Overall its a fast, efficient service and you get to spend as long as you want at the top, so you have no reason to not go as its open for most of the day as well. You can see quite clearly the flyer opposite and the park next to the building.

What it is about Singapore and seats by the way? Unless you go to the bar at the look out there are no seats to just sit and rest and take in the view - there is even a sign saying do not sit on stairs. Singapore does this again & again - whether it be malls or wherever, they seem to hate to have people sitting (doesn't make them money?). As someone that can't walk far and gets tired it's annoying.
Anyway, the views were good but really, 10 mins and your done.

We had a short time to vist the roof at end of a business trip and were unsure of the best way.

The SkyPark admission is on the outside of the hotel, there was a queue. We went inside and there is the SkyBar admission. You have to pay for both but the Skybar admisssion is redemable against the cost of drinks in the bar. Whilst expensive it means the entrance is effectively free.

The views are similar, the exception being that the SkyBar has restricted acces and it is more difficult to get the hte edge and there is no access to the infinity pool area.

From my perspective we made the right decision the views are fantastic..",08-2018,Business,2020-01-29 14:15:31.708810

I took option 2. What they don’t say is that option 2 doesn’t get you to the actual edge of the top floor but rather within the confines of the bars, and at one third of the span, all a good 3 or 4 metres from the edge. That said, I was still able to take some fabulous photos and see the busy harbour and panoramic surrounds in all their glory.

That said, you do get a great view of both the Marina Bay (great at sunset) as well as the Super Trees on the other side and both domes as well as the Ocean beyond that.

I ended up shooting with my phone using the panoramic feature which produced some cool shots and then again with my digital camera with a couple of lenses.

What I liked the most is that for the most part, you can actually take a photo without glass in front of you. There are basically protective wires instead which give you the ability to still shoot between then and get great shots. Most places have glass this high up.

One floor up is a bar, you can take a separate elevator there but there is a price minimum at the restaurant/bar there.

It is like a medium sized city all in one place and super convenient to everything. One of the top ten resort hotels I have stayed in world wide. Not cheap for sure, but if you can afford it you will not be disappointed. My only constructive feedback would be on the quality of pillows provided. I am allergic to feathers and requested a foam pillow and what I got was pretty disappointing. Large and hard. Having just come from China on this trip and staying at a Hyatt, I would have to say this was a negative. When you are spending this much per night, I would expect a quality pillow, not a budget one. As you spend almost a 3rd of your day sleeping, this is a key part of a 4 star rating for me seeing as I am spending a week and did not bring my own pillow from home.

We understood access to the top of this building came at a price, although we never saw that. The bar is ver stylish and the staff very friendly and efficient. We sampled (over a couple of visits) the Singapore Sling, Pina Colada, plus the bars own take on both of these drinks. They were fantastic!!

A walk Way around the bar external gives great views of the coastline and city and is ""heaving"" at night. Beers are around $15 and the cocktails we tried are around $28, so although expensive, they are on par with other places.

Lots of other bars and shops on the ground floor and basement levels too. We nipped into the casino (take your passport!) which was disappointing. Lots of very well off people, smoking inside (so a bit smelly) and gambling away at tables, many of which are $100'a bet!!!!

Have to say, if we were staying in the actual hotel, we would have been upset at the number of tourists wandering around, albeit residents only have access to the infinity pool.

The hotel inhabits three massive towers and the complex includes coffee shops, major restaurants and some (very expensive) souvenir shops.The entrance to the Skypark is by lift from tower three. From memory the cost is about twenty Singapore dollrs. On the dauy of our attendance access was virtually immediate but the facility has the reputation of being crowded at peak times of the year.
On the extensive viewing deck the vists are amazing, across the fishing boat harbor, the Staits of Malacca to Malaysia and to all points of the city, including the river walk precinct. It is possible to buy drinks and snacks from the roof top kiosk. All areas of the view receive explanation from shields set along the viewing area. It's fun to see areas of Singapore of which you are fond from that perspective.
The Skypark is strongly recommended, especially for first time visitors to Singapore.",12-2016,Business,2020-01-29 14:18:27.744834

We found it very hard to find the entrance to the hotel. It has three but some, that appear to be entrances are actually not and are on other floors. We were particularly looking for the observation deck and bar and, of course, went to the wrong end of the first. It is a very big building so not great to go the wrong way in this humidity.

We found the dedicated lift for the skypark is at entrance 3 of the hotel. The lift is great. It only has three floors, 1, 56 and 57. It gets to the 57th floor in seconds.

Once you get to the skypark there is really very little (as a non-hotel guest) going on. There is a view. A truly great view. A bar that serves pleasant snacks and a good range of drinks and thats about it. There is a substantial pool too but that is not open to day visitors,

We had a drinlk, ate some edemame, squid, oysters and salad (all of which were very nice) and left for our walk back to the Ritz Carlton.

The lifts used are not unique to Ground floor to Skylark use, so availability is varied and often the lifts don't offer much space at all as other hotel guests are in the lift already. Once up, no complaints! And our impression was that bar visitors got to visit the platform anyway.

A helpful tip - we decided to forego paying the $25 to just stand on the observation deck and went up a level (to where the restaurant/ bar is - right beside that AMAZING infinity pool). As long as you go up there and purchase a drink you can stand on the deck and get the same views!

The infinity pool and most of the rest of the rooftop is only accessible to hotel guests. The view was spectacular, but the light was poor and it was a little hazy. Great views of the city and nearby areas, but not much beyond that. Could not see Sentosa, for example.

The cost is a little high, $S23 for the ride up. The ticket office opens at 9:30AM, which I found out only after I arrived an hour earlier hoping for the morning sunlight. There were a couple of large tour groups with prepaid tickets who went up first. The ticket line was short, but the staff seemed to be extremely slow in processing the tickets. By the time I got my ticket, the tour groups had gone up, so there wasn't much of a wait for an elevator. A nice touch would have been glass elevators, but no such luck. Before getting on the elevator, you can have a souvenir picture taken. I chose not to. At the top, you walk out onto the sky deck. It is protected by glass walls at the bottom and sturdy metal cables and glass higher up. I never had a feeling of danger. There are a couple of cafes up there, but not much else.

As I said, it does not offer complete 360 degree viewing but you can get pretty close. Most of the obscured view is of the western side of the island. I spent about 15 - 20 minutes up there and took a few pictures. That was about all you need. There are diagrams along the railings detailing what is in the view.

Also Tuesdays there is a special at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant for half price drinks! I went at night which was lovely, there was a great breeze up there which helped the drinks flow quite nicely. If you go to Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Spago I highly suggest getting the 'Love you long time', BEST DRINK EVER! worth the money.

,1,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Fanny L,650238444,05-02-2019,4,"Not cheap, much better Singapore Flyer","3 reasons:
1) skypark admission is cheaper - Per head is $23, $20 for above 65. Not cheap. The flyer is charging crazy $33, in general, most of the attractions in Singapore are over priced. Skypark would increased the price by +$5 during the Lunar New Year period. However the experience is so much better Flyer
2) SkyPark is taller - Height of sky-park is 200 m, where as Flyer is 165 m. Not much, but the strategic location made a big different.
3) SkyPark offer more excitement, educational and photo opportunity - I personally feel the Flyer experience is boring and with less than 15 mins at the top to observe the buildings, difficult to take good photo inside the capsule, the entire journey is only half an hour. Whereas at the skylark one can walk around the observation deck at leisure soak in the panoramic view of the city with vantage point, take photos, stay as long as wish. Read interpretive and identify various buildings even even have a drink. If you are lucky during special occasions there’s also fireworks spectacular, but I imagine it would be super crowded.

It costs approx $20 and you are restricted to a small area down one end of the “park”. You don’t have access to the pool area, garden, park etc. This is now only for hotel guests (even if you pay the $20 entry fee). The view is no better than other nearby hotels such as the Oriental, or the nearby “Ferris wheel”. Obviously this is better for hotel guests, but it does mean it’s not worth a $20 visit for those not staying at the hotel.

You used to be able to walk around the pool area and that was worth the visit but not now that it is restricted.

It’s also super busy - even walking through the hotel lobby is stressful as there’s so many people. It’s like a loud obstacle course. It feels like the hotel itself has become a tourist attraction not a temporary “home” for guests.",12-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 14:22:57.665897

You get your photo taken on the way up, and by the time you get to the top, the hard sell of their photo packages comes into play.
When you get out onto the viewing platform, there is NO where to sit. So while it says you can stay as long as you like, in reality, there is little point in remaining there for too long.
Having bought the Frozen Drink, I did manage to find 2 bar stools to sit at while the drink was consumed.
It is not possible to get anywhere near the Infinity Pool, as this is for guests of the hotel. You can see it, and at 10am on a Saturday, it was pretty crowded with people.
So with a $30 ticket (inc Drink) and a picture, you are likely to spend $90 for less than an hour of viewing time, with no where to sit.

We initially went to the concierge desk adjacent to the casino and requested tickets to the skydeck but were advised to go outside to a desk catering solely for skypark patrons. On arrival at this desk we were told that entry was SGD 10 each but as it was approaching 10 pm we would only have approx 15 minutes before closing time. It was suggested that we go back to the original desk and request to go to the bars and restaurants where we would have the same wiews. Tickets cost us SGD 23 each but on reading the ticket it explained that if presenting the ticket when ordering drinks the ticket cost would be deducted from the drink bill. We eventually stayed for a couple of hours, the views of the city at night were fantastic and our drinks were discounted. What more could you want?",08-2017,Friends,2020-01-29 14:24:40.926929

We arrived to get tickets to the restaurant and after explaining to the woman at the desk what we wanted she still sold us the wrong tickets as we found out later she only sold us the observation deck tickets.
When we entered the bar area we were moved to the other bar as it was covered and it started to rain so there was no service.
When we moved one of our party was asked to pay for the drinks before we moved as it’s a separate bar to where we were sitting. She gave him $50 and we had to chase up the change of $25 after an hour and a half.
When we moved to the new area we asked if we could use the vouchers and we were advised we could by the waiter who moved us and the new staff until the tome came to pay the bill and they refused to give us the credit as we were sold the incorrect tickets.
When we asked to see the manager at the sales desk he refused to allow the credit and also refused to give me the name of the manager he was dealing with for an hour just to say no refund. At the same time he admitted there was miscommunication between the Restaurants up the top and there had the same problems before but still would come to the party. He offered us to go back up to the observation deck again that same afternoon. Great outcome isn’t it.
Just be sure you can get your ticket which can be redeemed and not just the observation deck one. It must be a coloured one.

Just to walk through the splendour of the ground floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel is mesmerising enough but follow the signs to the Skypark and you will not be disappointed. When we visited there was not much of a queue to purchase tickets at SGD 23 per adult. Have your photo taken before you go up if you must but we bypassed this extra! It’s then a 45 second trip up a staggering 56 floors to take you to the Skypark. It was a little hazy when we visited but still absolutely jaw dropping views, out over the city, towards the golf course and across the harbour where the huge cargo ships loom in the distance. You can get a drink and an ice cream up there and there is some shade if you prefer but just soak up that view and be amazed. So worth the ticket price!",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-29 14:25:20.777684

However the observation deck that is on the east side is accessible by a $27 elevator ride to the 56th floor. Lovely views all around the tower.

Strong winds can also destroy your umbrellas.
(NB: Singapore is a tropical country and convectional rain is very common on a daily basis).
The space allowed on the deck is only a small area, and so you wont be able to go into the pool, or the other side of the Skypark, hence you are limited in the span of view. Nonetheless, if you like to see the skyline of Singapore, it is still a good choice.

Thumbs down: Although the view is incredible, I cannot recommend visiting the observation deck as a tourist not staying at the hotel. The price is not cheap and the whole place is designed to herd visitors through like cattle.

Top tip: If you are planning to do the observations deck, give yourself a few hours beforehand to visit the Gardens by the Bay and then walk across to Marina Bay.

Conclusion: The experience felt like I paid $23 for an elevator ride. It may be said that it is similar to paying to climb the Eiffel Tower of Empire State Building however, having visited both those attractions I can say the experience is just not the same.

The city views are nice, just don't expect much more.",,Friends,2020-01-29 14:27:35.266491

I highly recommend you time your trip to be at the Skypark at sunset. That's when you get majestic skies and the city lights twinkle and awaken. If you wait even longer, you'll get a light show on the Harbour (but I disappeared before then to grab a bit to eat).

The Skypark itself runs like a machine. It costs about $26SGD per person to get to the top, and you'll find it can get very crowded up there. There are trinkets and food/drinks available up there but if you don't want to be hit by tourist prices for a meager hot dog, then eat before you go.

There's always the option of having dinner up there, but reserve a place as I don't think they take walk ins and it gets filled pretty quickly. Also, don't expect to be anywhere near the famed infinity pool. Lastly, the queues to leave are long and windy as there are only 2 lifts available up to the SkyPark, so leave yourself a loose schedule because you could be waiting a while to get down.

All in all, the experience is worth it. The panoramic views are breathtaking and the rest of the experience is just incidental.",12-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 14:27:51.087618

However, there are a few choice locations you can view it, from roof tops of skyscrapers like the MBS Skypark, or 1-Altitude, or Level 33, or even the roof top bar at Fullerton Bay hotel... these are all highly recommended vantage points.

However, the Marina Bay Sands Skypark is probably the most famous among the lot, although, not necessarily the best, nor my favourite. That's because, for the price you pay.. you just get access to views, and nothing else. You're not given a choice of drinks, or a cosy, comfortable place to sit and watch the world go by. In fact, it almost feels rushed, with tourists coming up, taking their photos, then leaving...

And besides, Marine Bay Sands is one of the most iconic buildings in Singapore... when you're up at the skypark, you can't possibly take a photo of the building when you're on it! It would make more sense to view it from across one of the buildings on the bay... like Level 33, or 1-Altitude. That way, you get to shoot beautiful pictures of the surrounding skyline AND MBS.

Each time we took the elevator to the 57th floor from Tower 1 and were able to look over Gardens on the Bay and the ships in the bay. It was an incredible view and did not cost anything. If you just go to the 57th floor - there is also a bar (open to anyone, you just need to buy an expensive drink) and pool (requires room key) on this floor. After getting back home to Texas, after doing some research, I just realized there is also the paid Skypark which looks like it has amazing views (can see both sides of Singapore). If money is no object, then you may want to try that...otherwise this is a good alternative but realize you will only see the Gardens on the Bay side. We didn't take any pictures the second time since it was raining, but our pictures from the first visit were amazing.",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-29 14:29:18.239518

The second way is to go up to the 57th floor, and it is free if you dine or have a drink in the restaurant Ce La Vie. Minimum purchase is $20 per person, which would get you a $16 Tiger Beer or a $24 cocktail. So you have a better view, and a slightly overpriced drink and the view, and save money.

What I learnt:

1) VERY expensive to see the view of SG.

2 Ticket Options:

i) $23 To look around the deck
ii)$20 for a drink ticket on the deck with the bar.

Not really worth either. 1 drink is $24 which is much more expensive than going to a market and over the price of the ticket.

2) Should you need to utilize the bathroom you MUST check in (like a toddler) with an employee.

3) Beautiful view not worth the price.

They will offer you to take a photo with fake background of MBS skypark. I guess it's better to have a photo with a real view like what they do in Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. There's only a small bar where you could buy drinks. I noticed that there's a restaurant/bar on top of MBS. If you want to access the bar, there's a security guard will immediately stop you. Maybe you have to access from the hotel's entrance. I don't get the logic even if you have money to pay. Or maybe that's their way of controlling the crowd. Or maybe they have a proper dress code before you could enter. It's better to just visit the Bar instead of going to the Skypark. We went there during the afternoon and waited for the sunset. The view is breathtaking. It was nice when we visited as there's a rehearsal for Singapore's national day. We managed to witness the jetplane rehearsal plus the fireworks!

Both times I did not pay anything to go up because I was accompanied by a friend who was a hotel guest. Anybody can visit the Skypark but you must pay SGD 20 at the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.

I don't really know how tall it is but the view up there is just fantastic. You get to see the Singapore skyline with the skyscrapers of the Business district. The Housing Development Board or HDB apartments can also be seen in their various designs. This is Singapore's public housing and a greater percentage of the population lives in these apartments.

If you do go there after 6pm you may want to catch the sunset in the direction of the island of Sentosa easily identified by the moving cable cars plying between Sentosa and the mainland.

From the Skypark you can also see the ships in the harbour but what is more prominent since Singapore is a container port is the transtainers that lift and move the heavy containers. Let your imagination run wild and perhaps instead of the transtainers you will see the white AT ATs of the Evil Emperor's camp in the Star Wars movie.

If you look down facing inland you see a body of water. From the shore (all water) to the area behind the MBS, it was all sea. MBS is sitting on reclaimed land and the body of water has been turned into a fresh water reservoir adding to many other man made reservoirs all over the island. As we do not have natural fresh water resources aside from buying some untreated water from Johor Malaysia, we turn to desalination.

Oops! The Skypark itself I think has more than 1 F&B outlets (please check with the frontdesk). The infinity pool is only open to guests. You can walk the length of the boat-like Skypark. If you've seen the movie 2012 when the Mayan Calendar predicted the end of the world with the great flood, don't you think that the MBS Skypark looks just a giant boat capable of handling that flood?",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-29 14:30:52.315776

Marina Bay Sands (MBS) has become an icon now for Singapore. Tourists to Singapore must pay a visit to MBS. Otherwise, you will be considered not being to Singapore.

MBS Skypark is the ship-shape structure above the three towers of 55-floor hotel blocks. The observation deck is worth the visit. From here you will get a panoramic view of the stunning Singapore city skyline including the iconic Garden by the Bay. At night, there will be a spectacular laser light show which you should not miss. Don’t be there in bad weather. You will not be able to see anything.

Tickets are priced at $23 for adults, $17 for children and $20 for senior citizen aged 65 years and above.

Admission is permitted between 9:30am and 10pm (11pm on Friday, Saturday and Sunday). There is no limit to the time guests may stay.

Mahd Nazri (Guest Attendant) was bubbly and friendly, had a small talk and he even explained to us that the lift will take only 35secs to reach to 56 floor. We were impressed by his service although it was a short time.

,1,6,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Jocelynp06,426419039,09-10-2016,4,Pricey But Worth the View,"Many people think you need to stay in the hotel to get to the top of the Skypark, but you can actually take the elevators to the top and go the resturant, bar, and view areas. There will be a few spots that you will need a hotel room key for access to some private viewing areas for guests, but the other areas where anyone can go are just about as good as the ones guests enjoy. So don't let that stop you from coming to see the view, which is free if you just want a good photo opportunity. For our group we spent a few hours on the rooftop listening to music, at a bar top table and had some cocktails. Just a heads up the most inexpensive beer or cocktail to purchase begins $25 SGD on upwards to just go with an open mind expecting to pay for a pricey meal and drinks because you are there for the view. That is what makes the experience worth-while. You can see for miles, and the water views of the Bay are stunning day or night. The Gardens by the Bay and the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel are in plain sight so there are so many things to see and take great photos from the top of the rooftop bars. If you want to have food, i Highly recommend making a reservation as even really late at night the place was packed. Oh, and dress up, it was definitely a place to be seen and sort of reminded me of Vegas, Miami, Paris, etc.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 14:31:24.628859

It is a wonderful view and worth the money to go up and take a look....you can stroll at your leisure around what amounts to about one-third of the total deck area...the rest is reserved for Hotel Guests only....

We bought the viewing deck ticket about 9pm....working out later that we could have gone up a floor....to 57..for no charge, and bought a drink there...and enjoyed the view for free...
But this does not allow you any access at all to the public viewing deck. Also it was $23 for adult entry to the deck...and $24 ++ for a simple spirit and soda drink...

We decided it was a good nighttime view...and worth the money to see the view from the skylark at least once.

On a future occasion, having now been there once...we might decide just to go to the 57th floor and have a drink. The elevator and reception/ticketing staff were incredibly friendly...one even offering to take our photo.

We were in position just before sunset, so we got some great pictures, then waiting for the 8 pm light/laser show. It was a little disappointing because we were too far to see it well & to hear the music/narration.

Obviously, it is exciting to be in a pool and gaze at Singapore's magnificent skyline from a great height. The other good thing is that there is an adult part and a children's part, and this rule is effectively enforced. Other than that, it is not really a great pool for a swim, as a selfie paradise the pool is dominated by people holding their mobile phones in all possible angles. Only accessible for hotel guests, you either book a room at the Marina Bay Sands (and I noted rooms are luxurious, bright and clean with excellent bathrooms) or you make sure you know someone who is staying there (one guest allowed to the pool).",07-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 14:32:43.702959

it is called ION Sky (you can google this also). It is located on the topmost floor of ION Orchard building.
To get there, take the MRT (public train service) to Orchard station, find your way to the 4th floor, then find your way to the elevator, located within an art gallery, that will take you to the top floor. Follow the signages or just ask.
ION Sky is free, Marina Bay Sands Skypark costs $22/$23 adult price (can't remember the exact amount).
Skypark is an open-air place, when it rains, there is nowhere to take shelter, and when it shines, it is hot & humid unless there happens to be a nice sea breeze.
ION Sky is an enclosed, air-conditioned place, so rain or shine, you get to see the views comfortably. And it is a 360 degrees view of the city. it is open daily from 3pm-6pm (last admission: 5.30pm). There will be a queue even before 3pm, so if it's a ""now or never"" visit, be sure to get there way before 5.30pm.
There is a bar & restaurant up there, the place will be closed to public when there is a private function.
However, you get different views at the 2 places (no sea view at ION Sky) so if want, go to both places.",01-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 14:32:44.455957

So many people walking around the hotel common areas in their room slippers and bathrobes, despite the hotel posting signs asking their guests not to do this.
The fact that they have to post the signs says alot about the type of guests they attract.
The food eating places (note I don't call them restaurants) cater for the masses, not surprising seeing how many guest rooms they have, sometimes bigger is not better, but Singapore doesn't know that yet!

So unless you have the luxury of time in Singapore, the trick is to choose which of these you want to drink in the superb view from (and spend your money on).

Preferences vary, but as a local who has tried the whole gamut, can I suggest that those of you who may baulk at paying the entry fee to the skypark consider getting light bites and a cocktail instead at the rooftop bar, Spago. Cocktails are excellent, you can linger in comfortable lounge chairs, you get a 180 view, and the vibe is great. Or head to CÉ LA VI which offers an even better view. You'll spend a bit more, but you get way more than an elevator ride to the observation deck.

The hotel part consists of three towers with a roof terrace that looks like a boat on top very iconic. The towers hold 2000 rooms. The roof terrace on the top floor 57 stories up has a infinity pool that can only be used by the guests and can only be accessed by your room key. Tower 3 is where the observation point is and you have to pay s$23 to use it. If on the other hand you don't want pay and would like to see the amazing looking pool and great views from the top use the lifts in tower one. There is also a restaurant on top of tower one that looked reasonably priced. Under the three towers are where some of the worlds top brands have outlets. There's a very large casino which is free to enter for tourists but not so for the residents of Singapore they have to pay s$100. Also in the shopping mall is various eating places and a canal with gondleers on which for a fee you can be paddled around. On the night there are two a amazing laser and water shows which are free 8:00 pm and 9:30 pm are the show times. The land that the hotel and complex sits is on reclaimed land that had to be left sitting for 30 years before being used but that rule is for all reclaimed land in Singapore. The land that the hotel and complex sits on is estimated to be worth 3.6 billion and the cost of the hotel was in the same price bracket. Overall this place has to be seen to be believed.

Simply ask to go to the bar, NOT the observation deck! Because once you get up to the observation deck, you cant just walk into the bar to get a drink either! Stupid rule...pay more, get less. The bar is even elevated so you get more of a view of whats below! If you plan to be there later than 8pm, make sure you wear smart attire though.

The staff are also very rude and treat you like cattle, its even worse than at an airport. ""Move up! Move up!"" Are the only words that come out of their mouths till the lift door slams shut for you to go up. Instead of ripping people off they should invest in training their staff basic customer service.

There is always some sort of credit card special on for a discount on the admission, so it is always worth asking for it.
An obligatory photo is taken before embarking on the elevator to the 56th floor and the sales people prize the photos a lot, yet they are quite expensive and probably unnecessary given that today practically everybody has a phone or camera with them.
Thereafter I take my guests to the bar on the 57th floor.
In February I took friends to the Sky on 57 restaurant. This was a bit of a disappointment because despite having made a reservation the table had no direct view of the skyline but of the restaurant's bar instead.

In reality a visit of 10 minutes is more than enough. I can't think of anything else I would choose to spend over £1/minute on indicating the level of rip off.

Plenty of designer stores at the shopping complex with casino located in that complex, and for the hotel tower itself remind me of Burg Al Arabs ( this iconic 7 stars hotel in Dubai)

I went to ""CÉ LA VI Club Lounge"" on a Saturday evening with a friend. No reservation required. It has the most impressive view of Marina Bay and Singapore dowtown.

There was an interesting mix of people from all over the world, a nice atmosphere with great DJ music. There was a dancefloor too, but not crowded that day. The club is right next to the infinity pool, but we could not enter as we weren't hotel guests.

It was my dream to go to this crazy and magnetic roof since they just opened Marina Bay Sands.

I can't describe my feelings, it's something what I will always remember and wish to come again and again. For sure I wish to live on this floor and look at the city center from the sky park :)))

Ticket costs 23 S$ (17$) but it worth it, it Worth it!!!! Not so much money and you will fall in love with such an amazing and special view.

From this roof you will see marleon park, beautiful skyscrapers, the biggest wheel, gardens by the bay and even Indonesian islands.
We went there at the afternoon, weather was great and we took very nice photos. You can come a little bit later and will stay there until evening and enjoy evening view as well.

That’s how we felt after the Singapore Night Tour. We went in the cool of the evening, were picked up from our hotel and went first to Gardens by the Bay – where we saw the light and music show under the Super Trees.

Next our coach took us to Marina Bay Sands SkyPark – a platform straddling two 57 odd storey high buildings. The all-round view of the lights and waterways, stretching one way to Indonesia and the other, to Malaysia, was breath-taking.

Next we were taken down to an arena on the side of the water-way and watched another synchronised light, music and water show against a backdrop of the water and city lights.

After a short walk along the boardwalk we boarded a launch which took us on a 20 minute trip up the river to Clarke Quay. There was recorded commentary on the way which gave the background of the several historical bridges we passed under and the buildings which boarded the waterway.

We alighted at Clarke Quay and had time for a walk around part of this vibrant entertainment and dining area.

The tour is jam-packed but not to the extent that it is not easy to handle.

We had a local Singapore lady as guide. She was excellent in shunting us - a group of straggly tourists – through the tight schedule. She was also an expert in pulling a couple of unruly boys into line, whose parents didn’t seem interested in doing so, who otherwise she said would have led us all to the very gates of hell. Well done.

Granted you can't access the entire area, or the pool deck, you can at least get a glimpse.

We went up about 30 minutes before sunset to see both day and night. It was amazing as the city transitioned into the evening. The sunset behind the city was just as impressive.

Singapore in itself has so many cool features, this is just one more stop of the many that photos don't do justice.

As we were there in December, we could see all the holiday decorations come to life in the park below, which was an added bonus.

The daily light shows were pretty cool, as the beams bounced off the surrounding buildings, but I think you get a better view from ground level.

As many other reviewers mentioned, sure, the drinks are pricey, but not as pricey as Raffles :-).

The only frustrating thing we experienced is that when night falls, people start camping along the rails - large groups of people that set up shop for dinner, drinks and just to hang out. Since part is open and part is glass, if you can't get near the rails, you can't get photos and you can't look down. So, you end up climbing over people.",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-29 14:35:07.927386
