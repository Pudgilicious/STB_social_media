After all, it is the only part of the Singapore Botanic Garden that is not free, so it probably subsidises the rest as well.

It can be mildly amusing to watch everyone avidly photographing the flowers - all amazing variations on a theme - just hoping to get at least some great pictures for the folk back home. There are so many! Orchids are rare in the UK, so it is wonderful to see so many different ones, but I don't think that many people would want to go back time and again. Once was great!

The three hectare orchid garden is certainly large enough for a visit in its own right, but it is surrounded by the Singapore Botanic Gardens, which a excellent, too.

The sheer colours, hybrids, shapes, sizes will leave you love this beautiful world a little more.

There is a VIP garden too with each orchids being named after a famed persona on a diplomatic visit. Visit it, you will love it.

Orchid Garden is located inside Botanical Gardens...while Botanical Gardens is free for all, entry to Orchid Garden is chargable but highly worth.

For tourists, only interested in Instragram photos, this is the place.

The retail shop stores products on a slightly high price though for a tourist memorablia, it's okay.

The Orchid Garden is highly recommended for anybody visiting our Red Dot.

There is plenty of benches around the garden, so you can rest and sit and literally smell the flowers.

I guess this fact speaks a lot by itself. Orchard Garden is a part of Singapore Botanic Gardens, was established in 19th century and has a huge collection of various orchids.

On the 31st of March 2017 the Learning Garden was opened. So you can easily spend half day exploring the gardens. Try to avoid hot periods of the day.

There are several marked photo spots along the paths that are specifically made so you can get a photo with lots of orchids around you. They can be popular so you may have a short queue.

If you adore the shape and colour if the flowers themselves then make sure you take a camera.

The Mist Garden is truly anazing, and was the standout 'must do"" of the gardens.

The Cool Room is a refreshing break from the heat, and has orchids to see too, but you will have to leave eventually.

Wow!!! Just do it.

If walking long distances is an issue, Burkill Gate is the closest access. There are no public buses or taxis waiting here to return though so you need to ring or book one, or hope another person happens to get dropped off there.

I read on the website that people normally spend thirty minutes there.
We spent more than two hours for watching the flowers and taking the photos.
It would be better to bring stroller for the kids and also some snacks and juice for them.
Although it is not too many mosquitos there, it`s safer to use the mosquito ripplent.
If you are a professional photographer, it will be pleasant for you finding beautiful view there.
In my idea, Orchid garden isn`t a unique place for tourists. It is just a clean and green place for an evening walk with the family.
If you are going to visit there lonely, don't forget your monopod!

There are hundreds of varieties of orchids which in itself is mind boggeling. The mist house is very beautiful. There are phot points from where you can take stunning photos with beautiful orchids in background.

We saw lots of people walking their dogs or jogging/exercising outside the Orchid Garden.

Make sure to bring something to drink and a snack for the visit. There was a lot of walking, and with the heat even in the morning, it can be quite exhausting. No concessions inside the Orchid Garden, and we spent about 2 hours seeing the various plants. We were there from 10am to around 12.30pm, and then took the MRT to Orchard Road Station to have lunch.

There is a restroom with limited stalls at the entrance/exit by the Gift Shop, and we did not see any other restroom facility inside the Orchid Garden. We visited during one of the Singapore school holidays and there was a long line at the end of our tour, waiting to use the restroom. We had to walk further, about 15-20 minutes that is still within the Singapore Botanical Gardens to find another restroom which was by a food court that was not as crowded.",03-2016,Family,2020-01-29 10:36:48.014144

Lovely grounds to stroll around, beautiful trees and a couple of lakes to look at. Refreshments available in several places as you walk around.
Not only trees and shrubs to see, we saw lizards and otters in the lakes.

You have to pay to enter the National Orchid Garden, its costs less than £4 and reductions for seniors. There are some very pretty colours and displays to see depending on the time of the year.
Very popular with visitors are the photo shot spots, you may need to wait your turn to get in the photo spot but is usually worth the short wait.

Just a hundred yards from the Orchid Garden exit is a taxi rank if you do not wish to walk back to the MRT entrance, fairs for the taxi's are quite cheap if there are 3 or4 of you.

I went with my aunt and uncle, who are both very keen and knowledgeable gardeners. They were overwhelmed by the whole experience and were amazed when they saw varieties of Orchids that they had never seen before.

The walk around the whole garden was a very pleasant experience and, like I said before, I was impressed with the layout, cleanliness and atmosphere of the place.

So why am I not giving it five stars? Well, there were some enhancement works going on the day I visited and so I did not get to see everything that I was looking forward to see.

Apparently the following areas have been closed for enhancement works since 10 July 2017:
Mist House
Bromeliad Enclosure
Cool House
Orchidarium
They will reopen sometime this year 2019 (more reason not to give it a miss!)

Having said that, despite these closure, the National Orchid Garden is certainly still a must-visit especially if you are a tourist, and more so if you are a flower-lover type of tourist!

It's a beautiful place to see a whole spectrum of orchid species, including hybrids especially cultivated in honour of VIPs.

There's an air of serenity just walking around to admire everything in bloom.

Best time to visit is in the morning to avoid the sun. Bring along an umbrella in case you need to shield yourself from the sun or rain (Singapore's weather is unpredictable!).

Depending on how long you wish to admire the flowers, a visit can last from as short as half an hour to as long as an hour if you must scrutinize everything and snap photos everywhere!

Afterwards, adjourn to the gift shop located at the exit to buy some orchid themed souvenirs home. Note: even for those not visiting the National Orchid Garden, access to the gift shop is still possible at the entrance.

There are restaurants just outside the National Orchid Garden, with a kiosk selling drinks, light snacks as well. Toilets are on site too. Since it's a garden, wear comfortable walking shoes.

We walked through the Botanic Gardens to the National Orchid Garden (located inside the Botanic Gardens.) (Currently, there is a SMRT station under construction near the National Orchid Garden. Check to see if it is open when you go.)

The National Orchid Garden was beautiful! As time passed, more people crowded in, so it is recommended to go early.

Every inch of the National Orchid Garden is a delight for the eyes, with over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids. Fountains, arbors and stone work structures and statues are everywhere, between all of the orchids! Bring your camera, but beware you will take many, many shots!

The gift shop at the National Orchid Garden has an excellent selection of high quality and reasonably priced items.

Instead of walking back to the SMRT Botanic Gardens station, we took a taxi back to the cruise terminal. There were several signs directing you to where you can catch a taxi. We ended up at the main entrance for the National Orchid Garden. There is a button you push that signals to taxis on the main street that there are people who need a taxi. Allow yourself a lot of time, as empty taxis don't appear to drive by frequently.

To repeat myself once again, truly amazing. The layout, the structure and general presentation were magnificent - We had forgotten just how beautiful the orchids (and the rest of the garden) truly were.

We visited the Botanical Gardens in February, when there isn't much colour in the gardens (even though they are beautiful), so the Orchid Garden is an absolute blaze of colour and a feast for the senses. The orchids are stunning and the range of colours, sizes and varieties just stunning.

The gardens can be very crowded, so if you want to take photos you'll need a shed-load of patience.",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 10:41:33.310278

,1,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,645849293,15-01-2019,5,Splendid: the World’s Best,"Singapore’s National Orchid Garden is the foremost place in the world to see orchids. Which makes it a remarkable attraction indeed, even if you’re not a fan of flowers. I can think of few floral equivalents anywhere: perhaps that rose garden with 7,000 species in Tuscany, or the Valley of Roses in Kazanlak, Bulgaria. But, leaving questions of beauty and fragrance aside as individual tastes, orchids are considerably more interesting that virtually any other flower around (except perhaps for a Rafflesia in full bloom, a morbid taste). Most, but not all orchids, don’t pop up out of the ground; they’re epiphytes which hang down from trees that they’ve hooked onto. This is survival strategy from the good old days 18,000,000 years ago or so, when they evolved. Then as now, the greenery at the canopy level of a tropical rainforest doubtless absorbed all the sunlight, leaving the jungle floor so dark and gloomy that only a mushroom could thrive there. So to survive, orchids deserted ground-level and became aerial flowers (see Airborne Orchids photo). They still love sunlight (see Sunlit Orchids photo). As you wander round the grounds, both the variety and exquisite beauty of the orchids is astonishing (see Orchid Walk photo).

The garden estimates that there are 25,000 to 30,000 different species of orchids on our planet; they’re mostly tropical, but range from the Arctic circle to Patagonia (by comparison, there are fewer than 6,000 species of us mammals, and the count keeps going down). I once discovered stunning orchids, to my shock, on top of Machu Picchu in the Andes (which is about 2500 meters / 8000 feet above sea level). This dedicated garden within the Singapore Botanical Garden, is the best place on earth to see them.

The total number of orchid species worldwide is a moving target, by the way. Among other causes of this, the National Orchid Garden itself is breeding brand new ones left and right as you read this review. If you’re a world leader and are coming to Singapore on business, odds are good that Singapore will have a new species of orchid invented for you or your spouse before your airplane even touches ground. Among the hybrids concocted here you might find splendid orchids created to honor a Japanese princess on the occasion of her wedding, a Finnish or Thai prime minister on the occasion of his or her visit to Singapore, or a British princess in memorium (see, respectively, Dendrobium Masako Kotaishi Hidenka, Dendrobium Matti, Ascocenda Yingluck Shinawatra, and Memoria Princess Diana photos).

The association between the Singapore Botanical Gardens and hybrid orchids is long-standing: in 1893, when Queen Victoria was Empress of India, and Singapore still reported to Calcutta, the director of the Singapore Botanical Gardens was walking down the road, whistling a merry tune as it were, when he spotted a very curious purple orchid hybrid in the garden of a Miss Joachim. Haven’t a clue who Miss Joachim was, but today her orchid is the national flower of Singapore (see Vanda Miss Joachim photo: her name, by the way, was Agnes, not Vanda, which is a type of orchid, though Vanda would have been a splendid name for the lass).

Singapore may not be the best place in the world for seeing either pyramids or winter Olympics; but it is the best place in the world for seeing orchids: don’t miss this one.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-29 10:42:11.735847

Go to the gardens and find some peace away from the hordes in a city now full of high end malls.",01-2019,Couples,2020-01-29 10:42:19.656640

The collection is not so extensive for anyone visiting with you who is not a gardener to become bored yet there is plenty to marvel at.

Smaller ones make you wonder if they are orchids at all as you peer closely at them, and the bigger ones grab you around your ears so to speak, shouting in your face. There are those resembling dainty fairies while others are like heavily bedecked grand dames out to dazzle you. Nestled amongst trees, shrubs and in smart rows all by themselves, these orchids fascinate with their longish creeper like roots anchored on other tree barks, bricks and charcoal in pots, belying their more fastidious natures. Then there are the ""VIP ones"" named specially after visiting celebrities--more often politicians. They are housed in this charming colonial style bungalow harking to a time long gone. Mostly I marvel at how these living plants have appeared to stop time, not unlike the faded sepia photographs of past generations, while their famous, still living, namesake humans have all gone forward to mark the many years that have elapsed.

Entry fee is minimal ($1 for seniors, $5 normally, 60p and £3 in Sterling), just compare that to attractions in say London! The orchid garden covers a reasonably large area, and you need to allow a sensible amount of time to fully explore the gardens, you'll not regret it.

There's plenty to see on the way, including the palm collection and the rain forest loop that adds around 15 mins to the journey. There is a lot of bird song in the trees and, if you're lucky, you may see oriental pied hornbill as well as minah birds. On the ground we came across a monitor lizard and several very tame birds that we later identified as red legged crake.
Entry to the orchid garden is a modest $5 per person which comes down to just €1 for seniors on production of documentation. The display in the building at the top of the hill gives the story of orchid breeding and has pictures of famous people after whom orchids have been named.

The only thing I was a little disappointed though, this is run by donations and online, I am sure that if there had been donation bowls or buckets am pretty sure that these would have been filled up as I was more than happy to throw some money into these had they been around.

Colorful and intriguing in their myriad designs, they thrive in our warm tropical weather.

In the air-conditioned Cool House, the highland orchid varieties are displayed. Many of them look exotic and their intricate designs are a joy to behold, especially in the coolness of its environment.

Nearby the Cool House, more lovely orchids can be viewed in their full blooms in Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse.

As the weather grew hot when noon approached, we adjourned to The Halia for lunch.

Just National Orchid Garden alone, there is so much to see and enjoy that it needs more than one visit.",07-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 10:52:56.278285

The gardens are huge and we had neither the time nor energy to cover everything but aimed directly for the orchid garden.
We were met at the entrance to the Botanic Gardens by a helpful staff member who gave us a quick description of the area and armed us with a site map. Entry to the Botanic Gardens is free but there is a small charge for the Orchid House.
The Orchid House is, according to the signs, a 450 metre walk from the front gate. I strongly suggest you wear a hat or carry an umbrella because there is little shade along the way. We also visited in May when it is not only hot but also very humid. We were dripping by the time we arrived at the Orchid House.
Once inside the plants and flowers were magnificent. How they managed to have so many of their orchids flowering at one time is difficult to understand, but it does make a magnificent display. This place is strongly recommended if you are interested in orchids.
After this we had another searing 450 metre walk back to the front gate. Thankfully there is a cafe style restaurant at the gate that sold cold drinks. We had several before moving on.",05-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 10:53:52.578461

Which is another way of saying that looking at flowers, and orchids in particular, can be cool. The walk across to the Orchid House sets the mood. Display after display of varieties that can inspire admiration from even we of the brown thumb gardening talents. Those with green thumbs will be absolutely delighted. Then you walk on elevated pathway through the double doors of the Orchid House and the coolness strikes you. Although still relatively humid, the artificial climate of the Orchid House is many degrees lower than the natural climate outside. Appreciably so. Even those men who have forgotten to provide flowers for their spouses on every wedding anniversary and birthday will want to linger.

In the gift shop, you can buy small genetically modified orchid that will grow later on. We didn't but it so we cannot testify the result here.

The Orchard gardens are thoughtfully presented with tags identifying plants and dedicated seating, or standing places, for visitors taking photos. The orchids are spread over several locations including a ""cold house"" and a ""mist garden"".

The flowers are beautiful and brilliantly maintained. We did not see a weed, a flower, or a leaf out of place.

The site is a credit to the gardeners.

It is a must visit for anyone interested in flowers.

Entry is a modest $1 for seniors (some form of ID required) and $5 for adults.

Nested within the Singapore Botanical Gardens (1 of 3 gardens to be bestowed the UNESCO World HeritageSite), the National Orchid Garden is opened daily from 8.30am to 7.00pm. Take a leisurely walk and feast your eyes on the varieties on display. Visit the gift shop and bring home the flowers in unique gift offerings.

And after the enchanting experience among some of the most beautiful orchid species, spend some relaxing time around the UNESCO Heritage Site and discover the tranquillity of nature to cap an excellent day in the outdoors.",02-2017,Couples,2020-01-29 10:57:37.804051

There are so many beautiful orchids here that after a while you become de-sensitized to the beauty of the individual species so take your time and take them all in.

We whet there with RMG tours ... it's the easiest way to see the sights of Singapore ... they come and pick you up at your hotel, take you around and drop you off ... but they always threaten to leave you behind if you are not at the meeting point at the appropriate time when it's time to go home .. but they never did.

Make sure you bring some water with you, as it can get quite warm in Singapore and the garden area is no exception.

For that I had unlimited time to wander round the paved areas between lush green vegetation that was liberally interspersed with orchids of various shapes and colours.
The layout was cleverly done so that either as ""clumps"", or individual settings, they made a visual impact. One major problem is the plethora of people with cameras who continually got in the way when you wanted to spend time viewing the magnificent blooms.
The location is well sign posted and there are various paths that can be navigated so as to ensure that all of the blooms can be viewed.

We enjoyed our traverse through the main gardens but the Orchid section was our target for the day. The presentation, variety, and maintenance of the Orchid Gardens were all superb. While we are not experts in orchids, we still felt the varieties in bloom were amazing and our viewing rapidly approached sensory overload, not to mention taking up quite a few MB on our camera SD cards!

There were several teams of workers seen throughout cleaning and manicuring the gardens which were impeccably maintained. The use of water features and mixed hardscape were most attractive.

The walk is delightful to the Orchid Garden, but give yourself some time. The signs within the park are almost randomly placed and are strangely inaccurate.
No, its not just you, I'm good with signs. Also if you are not fit and not good with heat do not do it on foot. It is a long way, and while I'm a fit 50+ year old I struggled with the heat. I think it a great opportunity to bring back the rickshaw (gasps from the audience) as it would be the coolest and grooviest thing. Oh, and NO not the Raffles rip-off rickshaws, go easy on the tourists for heaven's sake we are all a bit tired of being exploited. A fair price and we will come again and again. We probably would tip well too.
The gardens are inaccessible to a lot of people who are obese or frail or just plain tired. If you put us in a wheelchair or a motorised cart you only advertise our infirmity to the general populace, which marginalises us.
The park should be filled with water stations-filtered and refrigerated water stations. Its a kindness that we shall not forget. Again no, no overpriced bottled water, we have enough of that from our hotel, thank you very much. The entrance fee is a bit hurtful-do you think you could give a small bottle of chilled water as a gratuity as we go in? It would cost...what...20 cents? Thirty ?

We have a small collection of our own but after seeing these, I need to figure out how to acquire some of these.

Just like the botanic garden there were many different sections. However the orchids added so much color to the landscape they facilitated a lot more photo taking opportunities. So many people were carrying big SLRs here.

The entire garden was lush and green which I attributed to the hard work of the large number of gardeners who were everywhere pruning or watering.

A nice paved path and recommended directions enabled me to easily access and experience every section. The house at the top contained varieties named after famous visitors. Another section displayed those varieties created here. Waterfalls, ponds, walk in cages, metal statues, trellises and rock formations were all creatively used to showcase these orchids.

Towards the back a new section was under construction to further expand the park. Artist renditions were posted and looked like it will be another well designed addition.

When you see the National Orchid Garden sign that many people will be taking pictures in front of, look to the RIGHT and enter the little building. You then pay a fee and go through some turnstiles to enter the garden. I went on a Sunday and it was pretty empty, even though tons of people were taking pictures out front. It seems that many are turned off by the modest fee the park charges. It is well worth it!!

Don't go to the left of the National Orchid Garden sign. The walkway to the left has some orchids so it's deceiving, but you're just walking in the free Botanical Garden section.",01-2018,Solo,2020-01-29 11:12:11.233667

VISITED AUGUST 2016

This memorable visit was one of the highlights of my Singapore City Sights tour, so I decided to make this a separate review.

Entry to the orchid garden was to the left, through a gift shop and a set of turnstiles. It wasn’t long before one could hear gasps, as visitors saw the beauty that lay before them. As a keen photographer, I was eager to ‘capture’ as many orchid images as I could. Attached are but a few.

Upon entering the gardens, we were instructed by the tour guide to be back at the coach in one hour. As the orchid garden is part of the botanical gardens, this time period wasn’t nearly long enough. Should I visit Singapore again, I will travel to the gardens independently, so I could stroll freely to enjoy this wonderful landmark.

For photographers and orchid lovers alike, a visit is a must.",08-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 11:14:51.098663

It’s one of my favorite haunts for photographing orchids, especially when there are so many varieties on display at any one time. I visit the place several times a month and was there this morning. There are admission fees (see below) but this week being a school break week, admission was waived for senior citizens and school children.

It’s good to go early in the morning when the tour buses have not arrived. Otherwise the National Orchid Gardens can be pretty crowded. Around 9 am in the morning is about right. It’s still cool and fairly quiet, almost like having the place entirely to oneself. It’s wheel chair friendly. No free WiFi. There a lot’s of places to sit within the grounds and shaded areas to cool off. Unfortunately, the public toilets are where the exits of the Orchid Garden are, next to the Gardens shop. Bring a hat, drinking water, unless you want to pay tourist’s prices at the kiosk! For the sensitive, a mosquito repellant may be desirable. Watch out for ‘photo spots’, areas prepared for you to take a selfie or a picture with a picturesque background. You cannot get lost as there are adequate signs around to point you in the direction you want to go.

My favorite is the Tan Hoon Siang Misthouse where there’s a concentration and display of orchid flowers. It’s here I shoot many of the orchid flowers in my photographic collection. I usually spend just over a hour in this section of the Botanic Gardens.

We started off with the kid’s section which was a bit of a dud even if you were a kid. Well I am being a bit unfair – I think it is more suited to kids under 5. Once we were done with that I headed for the National Orchid Garden. It was a lovely walk with everything from bonsai trees to gazebos in-between. Near the entrance to the Orchid Garden is Halia. I stopped in here for a coffee and it has a lovely atmosphere – again would be a great place for a proper lunch.
Post caffeine it was into the Orchid Garden. This is a big place!!! It is very beautiful – they have made the most of every step with lots of benches surrounded by gorgeous orchids all designed as Photo stops! It is selfie stick central in here especially as I went on a Sunday – helper’s day off.
There is every type of orchid experience you could imagine – orchid strands developed for VIPs from Margaret Thatcher to Kate and Wills. There is a mist room as well as a cool room for the rarer strands. It is almost easy to get lost in here!
Last up was a stroll down to Swan Lake. I had read there were mute swans on the lake and for some reason this intrigued me. Alas by the time I got there I was rather exhausted from heat and walking and only took a cursory look around – no swans! It was rather steamy and overcast by this time so dreadful light thus no photos. It would be worth coming back here in different weather conditions.",07-2016,Solo,2020-01-29 11:15:14.940487

Moving forward there are wooden bridge walkways with dense greenhouses full of mist. As you explore further, the place gives you a hint of being in an orchid forest. It is commendable how everything is maintained in its natural form. It is metaphorically a place to lose your way and absorb the nature at its very raw.

Not just limited to orchids.

It was noticeable that the most impressive orchids were in pots (albeit well hidden) with many of the large specimens in the beds not in flower, but that may reflects the time of year or the natural tendancy of mature orchid plants not to constantly flower...

From the moment you walk through the doors (S$5 entry charge) you see the most fabulous water fountain surrounded by orchids as far as the eye can see. Of course there are the usual Vanda orchids however I was blown away with not only the amount of orchids on display...all flowering, but also the number of exotic species.
I went on a Tuesday and there were a few people there, including what appeared to be a tour group, but they did not impede on my experience at all. Most of my photos had no people in them so that gives you a bit of an idea of the capacity of the gardens. The area is so large that you can find a shaded corner somewhere and just relax...keeping in mind you are in Singapore and it's always hot outdoors. I was very surprised to get to the Cold House and it was empty for at least 10 minutes!
A must see is The Mist House (which is not far from the Cold House) which is literally filled with award winning orchid specimens from around the globe - honestly it was so beautiful and I could have spent more time in there. Also nice to see is the VIP collection located near Burkill Hall.
At the end of the garden is a gift store (of course!) but I must say it was a very well appointed with good quality souvenirs including the lovely brand Risis which takes real orchids (various different specimens) and plates them in 24 carat gold or in silver if you prefer. Every piece is individual and for S$70, I had to have one. They also sell them at the larger gift store near the Botanic Gardens entrance/exit. All in all I spent approx 2 1/2 hours in the National Orchid Garden. I love photography and I took over 500 photos. Of course you could spend a lot less time in there, but don't underestimate the time it will take to see what appears to be a very small part if the Botanic Gardens map.

Having stumbled upon the orchid gardens we decided to go in - on $5 (Singapore) to enter, so not a great impost.
They make a massive effort in the orchid gardens. Huge displays of orchids of many different varieties have been carefully built up by the gardeners. The orchid gardens are quite large with many displays so there has been a big investment by the gardens.
There is a large room that displays orchids named after prominent people visiting Singapore, and I was startled to see one named after Rodrigez Duterte, the Phillipines PM, who does not appear to have a lot in common with delicate flowers...

,1,4,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/changpy,646205572,16-01-2019,5,Botanical Gardens: A National Treasure,"The Botanical Gardens often draw a lower rating than the Gardens by the Bay. Agreed the latter is a more impressive technological feat and usage of space. It is set against the futuristic backdrop of Marina Bay Sands. It nicely categorizes and collates all types of species of plant. For a visitor following a tight schedule, it might be the better choice. My personal vote (as a 34 year resident and naturalized citizen) is solidly on the side of the Botanical Gardens. This gem is more authentic and historical, shaped more by Nature's hand than an computerized architectural model. It's generally less congested, more spread out and, for most attractions, free of charge. The free Sunday concerts in the outdoor amphitheatre might draw a large crowd butt most of the time the Gardens offer an ideal venue for a leisurely stroll, jog or quiet contemplation.
If you still want more of an over the top features of Gardens by the Bay, you will find it the National Orchid Garden. For a modest admission fee ($5 general, $1 senior citizen), you can walk through some exquisite arranged foliage, pass through an old colonial black and white to view a spectacular orchid garden (with various species named after famous visitors to Singapore) and detour to an enclosed Arctic ice garden to make quick work of any perspiration. Our guests and visitors have never been disappointed. A few caveats:
1. It can get congested especially by shutterbugs staging photo shoots. You are likely to cross into the line of camera or Iphone.
2. For the past year, the site has been under heavy construction with most of the Orchid Garden and the Ice House closed down (but full admission still charged!). The National Parks Board should have scrapped the fee because without those two features, even the $1 for senior citizen charge seems overpriced.
3. Borrowing from the Las Vegas casino floor plan, the elegant stroll through the Garden deliberately ends at a very overpriced gift shop which one is obliged to pass through.
The real beauty of the Botanical Gardens is in tits natural layout, not in the carefully constructed attractions like the Ginger Garden, Rainforest or Orchid Garden.

It has wonderful photo opportunities for all levels of photographers. I found I had some really lovely photographs from the visit as I did take time to focus on the orchids and it was relaxing on this point as well.

I did find it difficult at some spots - the most photographed ones it was easy to see to actually take a picture without someone stepping into the camera range. However it is a national (international as well I suspect) to gain these photos and I did give up on some. However as the time we travelled on in the park people were not as close in walking together. My friend and I had a wonderful time having some time to chat and walk around the park. It is humid here, the orchids grow so wonderfully so you will see why. Take plenty of water and don't race around the park.

The orchids and gardens are beautiful. It is a tranquil and enjoyable place to take a stroll with a friend or partner as something relaxing to do together outside of the hustle and bustle of the city.

I bought a cushion cover with an image of an orchid on the front of the cover. It seemed quite well made. Not cheap but it looks as though it is good quality for a gift. Assortment of colours. Other items to purchase as well in the shop.

Others are named after celebrities and very important people who have visited Singapore.

Last admission, though, is at 6pm. Fees for admission are $5 (Adults), $1 (Students). free for kids below 12 yrs. Senior Citizens (60 yrs & above) pays $1.

Orchids, orchids, orchids, and more orchids! Over 1000 species and over 2000 hybrids can be sighted - so says the brochure. In reality, it is a dazzling display of gorgeous blooms and hand-crafted hybrid crosses, well manicured grounds and fantastic layout and mind-boggling presentation.

Turn around. Drink in glorious English landscaping.

And the largest display of tropical orchids in the world. For sure.

Pride of place, and visitors' favourite, is the VIP Orchid Garden.

Outstanding hybrids from the breeding programme of Singapore Botanic Gardens are used to promote goodwill and foster closer ties between ations since 1956. This prized attraction features orchids named for Margaret Thatcher, Princes Diana, The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (William and Catherine), The King of Malaysia, Mrs Laura Bush, The Prime Minister of Kuwait, The Governor General of New Zealand, Mdm Paloma Picasso,

Overlooking the National Orchid Garden is Burkill Hall. This restored Anglo Malayan plantation house, the last one standing in the region, and possibly the world, is available for rental for weddings and special occasions.

Designed like a farmhouse, it was built to function without electricity - ie verandas on the east and west sides creates a wind-tunnel effect. It served as the residence of the Garden's superintendents and directors for more than 100 years.
Burkill Hall was built in 1886 and was named after the only father and son pair to hold the post of Director of Singapore Botanic Gardens, Isaac and Humphrey Burkill

The beautiful Burkill Green, the picturesque lawn fronting the colonial building, and the building itself, captures the romance of a by-gone era.

Its more like a walk in the garden. While the S$5 entrance fee is affordable to many, I feel its not worth it.

I have no idea why this garden is selected and awarded as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There ain't anything historical about it (for Christ sake, anything around can be 150 years old). I am rather disappointed at this ranking/award by UNESCO as it is very misleading.

As compared to Phuket Orchid Farm, National Orchid Garden is just 1/4 of what the former have to offer.

My take, visit only when you have the time. Its not exactly conveniently located (yes, there is a train but its 1.5km to the nearest entrance).",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 11:29:18.192021

We have many visitors (spare room occupancy rate is circa 60%) and first time visitors always have this put high on their itinerary.

Regardless of age, professed interests or gender people love this place. And what is not to love? Walking among fabulously well tended gardens with spectacular flower displays year round, an appreciation of Singapore's orchid led diplomacy, up close to an historical building are all experiences to be had.

Even on crowded days (lose the bus tour crowd asap by slipping off the main path) there is so much to be appreciated and to be soothed by. Then outside, the gardens - just wonderful to walk through.

Couple of practical tips:
- if you are short of time, have the taxi driver drop you at the nearest gate (he will know it!) see the Orchid Gardens and save the rest for another time
- a cool drink can be had in lovely tropical surrounds as well as a good meal at The Halia just by the Orchid Gardens
- The Orchid Gardens close earlier but the the Botanic Gardens in which they are located are open until (I think) midnight. Safe as houses to walk and achingly romantic
- if you are 60 or over, confess and they let you in for less!

Gardens by the Bay is the flashy new kid on the block - the real thing is here!",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-29 11:29:18.433935

As the name states, it is a garden full of orchid. From the moment you step through the turnstiles, there are orchid at every corner. There are many Photo Stops well designed for visitors to have nice photo with the orchids. There are many varieties of orchids. I personally like the one that looked like a flamenco dancer.

The garden can be a little confusing at first because there are many ""cross-roads"" and you may not decide which to go. However, if you have 1hr to spare, you can venture the entire orchid garden. And if you have more than 1hr, you can slowly admire all the orchirds that are on main display and also flowers that are hidden along the walkway, largely ignored by rushing visitors.

If you are feeling warm, there's a Cool House of about 15m long where you can cool off.

I would recommend to visit in the morning as the weather is cooler and the sun is bright. Or after a rain, the water droplets add more life to the flowers and a cooler surrounding (A cooler outdoor in Singapore may be as low as 28 Deg C).

Bring a macro lens or a camera with macro functions (I believe the new smartphones are good enough too), it's fun taking picture with the lovely orchids.
