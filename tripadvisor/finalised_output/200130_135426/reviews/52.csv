Chose a ""Authentic Chinese Restaurant"" at #50. 2 of the most pathetically watered down cocktails I've ever had. Then the ""average"" dumplings arrived....with the watered down soy. The bottom of the area on plate where soy was had been coloured black and hid the fact that the sauce was so watery is was a joke.

Numerous restaurants , drink bars bars are aligned along the waterside at Boat Quay. These bars and restaurants are mostly old shop houses which have been conserved. The cosmopolitan banking sector lies behind Boat Quay. The parliament house is located opposite to Boat quay.
There are Conserved shop-houses that line both sides of Circular Road at Boat Quay.

The night view of the restaurants and pubs along the Singapore River are wonderful and enjoyable. Also there are several Sculptures at Boat Quay that depict activities carried out on the banks of Singapore River in the 19th and 20th century. There are light and fountain shows during the evenings at Boat Quay. An evening stroll at Boat Quay with a drink or two is a great option.",01-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:11:54.855509

Add to that the restored shophouses on the restaurant side of the river and you have the perfect picture for the tourist guides. And when you are there, you have at least 50 restaurants to choose from. So what could possibly go wrong? The answer is that the restaurant bill could be much much more than you were expecting. Most of the restaurants have the usual front of house staff urging you to stop and eat. Some are irritatingly aggressive, but no more so than other similar locations. The problem lies with the menus, because they often do not have prices, and when they do it is not necessarily helpful eg by showing a charge by weight. We sat down and ordered a straightforward meal for three. No starters - just a main course - and nothing expensive like crab or lobster. The menu seemed much the same as most of the other restaurants - all of the items were accompanied by a picture of the food. Something inside me told me to ask the price of the food that I had ordered. I was shocked when I was told that it would be S$216, plus 10% service charge plus GST. I said that was too much and that I would pay for my two cokes and a bottle of water and leave. The manager offered to reduce the price by 30%, but I still thought that excessive. I was charged S$18 for the drinks - one of the most expensive cokes that I have ever had! When you compare the price asked with the typical price that you would pay at one of the Hawkers (the name given to the restaurants found all over town), namely S$15 maximum per person, the Boat Quay prices are astonishing. Of course you expect to pay extra for the great view and atmosphere, but four times as much? My problem is not so much that the prices are excessive (they are in my opinion) but that they are not on open display. You do not necessarily know what you are going to pay and of course once you have eaten the food you have no option. My advice is that when you order, ask them to tell you how much the bill will be BEFORE they start to prepare the food, so that you can decide whether it is acceptable. And watch out for the 10% service charge and GST which probably will not be shown to at this stage but will add almost 20% to the price.",04-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:12:12.360254

This was once a very nice place to sit beside the river and have a drink and/or a meal. A great setting with decorative awnings which differed from outlet to outlet. Now, in an apparent attempt to upgrade and probably modernize the place, Boat Quay has become typical of what we see happening in the rest of Singapore. The character has been completely lost with the use heavy, black, uniform steel girders stretching the whole length of the quay side which has absolutely no character whatsoever. There is very little protection to diners when it rains if sitting close to the edge of the quay. Don't the government realize what a gem they have, or did have in Boat Quay? I have been coming here for over twenty years and was looking forward to seeing the change; but can't say how disappointed I was. It seems like the whole refurbishment has been done ""on the cheap"" with absolutely no creativity or imagination. The whole length of boat quay has been replaced by a standard width (to save cost I would guess) of heavy metal awnings which means where the wider part of the quayside exists, there is considerable lost space. This will inevitably mean that now some restaurateurs will lose money because they can no longer fit in as many tables.

Added to the sterile look of the place is the ridiculous decision to increase the rents of all the businesses which operate there, This cost, no doubt, will have to be passed on to the customers, thereby making an already expensive place to socialize even more expensive. And no doubt also, you will see more and more establishment close and re-open than before. Another money making scheme by the establishment? I think so.",10-2016,Family,2020-01-30 14:12:14.864540

Location – Located just above Raffles Place MRT station this place is a tourist & local attraction now & the river is quite cleaned up. During the day, nothing much happens but as the sun goes down it comes alive & becomes a happening place until last order around 10 pm & may be later over the weekend.
How to reach – It can be reached by various public transport options (Train, buses as well as taxis). If it is raining you better carry an umbrella because the approach road from all the sides is pretty open.
Nearby – From here you can walk to Clarke Quay which is another recently upgraded riverfront with lot of happenings & connected by a walkway. On the other side of the river is Supreme court building & a museum. There is a Chinese temple nearby & you can walk to the famous merlion via Fullerton hotel which was a main post office during British era.
Size – A stretch houses close to 100 bars & restaurants. You name it they have it Thai, Chinese, Indonesian, Indian, Western etc. Kinara restaurant is my favorite & if you book in advance they will reserve a seat for you by the river for your dinner. The food quality is consistent for over two decades since it has been there.

This is probably the place. Informal, bustling and eclectic atmosphere and lots of food to choose from. However, check reviews first and don't be drawn in too easily by the waiters who will accost you. Once you are confident a place looks good, there is something else to watch out for and that's the prices. There are quite a few tricks which can be pulled to convince you a dish is a good deal when it is actually a total rip off. Check and double check what you are getting and how much it costs. If you are ordering prawns, is the price for one or for a plate? If they are offering complementary extras, are they really complementary or do they cost extra?

Earlier review mainly highlights the historical evolution of this area near Singapore river. Photographs taken earlier were in full daylight. This visit to the place was at night time. We started from the office around 6 pm to have us in this area & finished it at Song Fa Bak Kut Teh restaurant at new bridge road. After dinner we decided to walk until Fullerton hotel & catch a taxi from there.

It was a slow walk of about 15 minutes but we enjoyed it. The bridges & surrounding was illuminated as if like a festive season. Subway passing below the road was lighted like a studio. Restaurants on one side & river on the other with occasional passing of boat of river cruise gave it a flavor of typical tourist destination.

We stopped outside many restaurants displaying their live sea food offering. It was tempting but we were done for the day. Laser beams from top of Marina Bay Sands reminded us of the daily free show going on out there. This place gets more crowded over the weekends & as compared to daytime it is much cooler at night.",03-2018,Business,2020-01-30 14:16:50.332699

This place certainly encapsulates the best of Singapore, from the preservation of the historic buildings along the river bank to the transformation of a derelict and dirty river into a world-class attraction.

,1,52,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/finesilver,528374293,30-09-2017,4,Interesting vibrant part of the City on the Singapore River,"The River has three main quays, this is the first one you will encounter as you walk along the River from Marina Bay and the Fulllerton Hotel. It is on the opposite side of the River from Clarke Quay. It is bound by my two favorite bridges Cavenaugh Bridge and Elgin Bridge.

This place was the main center of commerce until the 1960's and has slowly transformed to its current state of being a major entertainment district with a wide variety of popular (well deserved) bars and restaurants. it is quite touristy in every regard from the tourists checking it out, from the families walking through the area and shopping and/or looking for just the right spot to go into, to the fairly aggressive touts trying to get you to come to their place.

The food is consistently good and so are the bars, tourist level expensive too. Note that during the day, there is not a lot of shade at these places, so these are better at the end of the day and into the evening when the sun is down and the place is about 10 degrees cooler if not more.

Also, I read that there are some great places without the tourist shtick a block or two from this Quay. I checked them out and found this to be true, in fact with better restaurants it seemed and where there were more tourists seemingly in the know at those places versus getting sucked into Boat Quay or Clarke Quay a little further down.

Just behind this is Raffles Place by the way.

Again, like everywhere, this Quay and both bridges present many wonderful photo ops both of the water scene, and nearby buildings and skyline.

Note too that there is a small bronze statue of some jumping children purportedly jumping into the River at Cavenaugh Bridge. Some people call it 'drain cats"". Also worth seeking out while at Boat Quay. Some great photo ops there too. There is a boat stop too at this Quay, so you can get on or off the River boats at this Quay also.

Definitely worth seeking out on any visit to Singapore.",09-2017,Business,2020-01-30 14:16:52.115904
