,1,56,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/SurfingWild,680032150,09-06-2019,4,Standard modern shopping mall,"Raffles City Shopping Centre is pretty much like most of the other modern shopping malls in Singapore. It has an MTR Station down below and a decent food court and lots of shops including a Marks & Spencer and a Robinsons. The mall is also well situated being very close to several historical sites such as St, Andrew;s Cathedral, the Raffles Hotel, the War Memorial and the Padang, all of which are a short walk away.

Other stores here include Timberland, Rolex, Furla, Coach, Mango, Moje and Starbucks etc as well as so many others.

This used to be one of our favourite malls but a recent bad experience at a restaurant called Poulet in the food court has disappointed us. However, for people looking for a pleasant shopping experience then this is a nice mall to visit.

One thing to note is that during rush hour and whenever it is raining the Grab fare increases dramatically. We were staying in Balmoral Park just off Stevens Road and normally it costs around S$7 or S$8 for a ride between Raffles City and Balmoral Park, but at rush hour the fare quickly increases to around S$35 and above. So when the Grab prices increase at rush hour then it is better to take a normal taxi.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-30 14:32:17.905733

It's very clean, as is almost everything in center city Singapore.

Most of the stores are high end, as is true of many of the newer malls in the city.

It nonetheless has several favorable attributes.

These include:

A small supermarket in the basement with a good selection of products that are competitively priced. If you need drinks, snacks, fruit, etc., their prices are less than the smaller convenience stores. You can also buy prepared sandwiches.

A nice food court with a wide variety of reasonably priced options, especially for breakfast and lunch. Prices aren't as cheap as at the hawker centers, but the food court is air conditioned, you can find a table, and it's clean. Although the general stores open at 1000, many of the food stores open at 0730-0800.

Finally, the mall is next to the City Hall MRT, allowing easy access to the the East West and North South Lines.

Unfortunately, I'm writing a mall review.

You go to a mall for convenience, not for eclectic food or funky mom and pop stores.

As long as you temper your expectations, Raffles City may be worth a visit (if you're close).",11-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:33:14.033728

The set up looks clean and neat, really nothing to complain about.

The only issue I want to highlight is that the duck was not fantastic comparing with many hawker store and even foodcourt.

You are only paying for a cleaner set up with aircon condition.

This was my first visit to London fat duck

My honest opinion to the management - if you want to sell your normal food in an exorbitant pricing, you will have to make sure your food is justify for that price range.

Last but not least, I’ve tasted numerous roasted duck from many stores around Singapore, and I know exactly how big a duck drumstick portion looks like. You are shortchanging your customer by cutting a portion of meat from a drumstick ( a portion of meat was removed from the base of the drumstick as shown in the picture). The entire drumstick was meatless, mainly bone. That portion of meat being removed from my drumstick will sell to another customer.... this is something some of the hawker store are practicing awe well.

This review is to create awareness, especially to tourist out there, just need to be mindful there’s such thing happening.

Personally I think the Singapore government wasted their money on this one... S Dali should have stuck to paintings! But it's quite exciting for art lovers to come up close & personal to a real Botero!!! And the Diving Boys is quite sweet & nostalgic (a bye-gone era!)",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 14:36:00.538364

There are dozens of different food outlets with a variety of cuisines and most of it is freshly cooked whilst you wait. Prices are a fraction of what you would pay in a so called ""proper"" restaurant in this city and the atmosphere is buzzing with a mix of locals and tourists. Just find somewhere to sit and enjoy.
