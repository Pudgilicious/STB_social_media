It didn't disappoint in the least; the streets are narrow, pretty and have a myriad of shops and stalls to shop at. The Sultan Mosque is the imposing centerpiece of the area and has a whole bunch of informative plaques surrounding it with the history of the area.

Stroll around to get a nice view of Masjid sultan, swing by on kandahar street to bite into famous swiss roll at rich and good cake shop. Stroll around to absorb singapore's malay culture.

I'm glad I did a lot of research/read lots of travellers' reviews (thank you TripAdvisor reviewers!!). We stayed at Parkroyal on Beach Road which is opposite Arab Street area in Kampong Glam. My teen daughter and I felt safe at all times walking around this area. A bonus is the 10-min walk to Bugis Junction shopping centre & MRT station. We didn't take any taxis during our stay. Great restaurants, cafes, bars in this area. Note there is an Easy Way self service laundromat 500 metres towards the golden mile complex - heaven sent after a few days travelling and desperately needed to do a full load of washing. In the residential area where the laundromat is there are also cheap local tiny shops selling basic foods (eg. Ice tea, biscuits, packet noodles) to stock your hotel fridge with snacks. I highly recommend this part of town, or Bugis to stay in. Even my fussy daughter says it is ""really nice"". Super convenient to hop on MRT train lines to get to all the usual tourist spots.

Prior to the British colonisation, Kampong was the home of the Malay aristocracy ( still part of Malaysia at this time).

In fact it was the treaty signed between the Sultan of Johor and the British East India Company that saw Singapore become a Free Port.

Under Raffles, the settlement was set-up into distinctly ethnic enclaves which is why Chinatown, Little India & Kampong Glam developed with such distinctly different styles, which mostly remain today. And all tourists can be thankful for that.

Arab Street, Bussirah Street & Haji Lane are the most visited and most distinctive.",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 13:55:47.035527

We started at Masjid Sultan Mosque, and then the Malay Heritage Centre next-door and former home of Sultan Husssein who, financed by the East India Company, was responsible for the mosque (both unfortunately closed when we visited). Next door again is the Yellow House, home of the Sultan's grandson and now a restaurant. We wandered our way down Sultan Gate, Kandahar St, Bussorah and Badhdad Sts, and then Arab St, and Haji and Bali Lanes. Here we find many eating houses, carpet traders, tailors (both men's and ladies'), mercers, fashion accessories. The style of the shop-fronts started as traditional and became more funk-tourist as we approached Bali Lane.

Lots of great little streets and shops and colourful murals on the building walls.

Whilst there we also had a look at the Istana which is the former Malay Palace and the Sultan Mosque from the outside only. So we might have to go back and visit these properly next time we are in Singapore. One thing we wouldnâ€™t have noticed if we hadnâ€™t been on the tour is that wall just under the gold dome of the Sultan Mosque is mad out of old bottles that were donated for its construction.

* Baghdad Street - which runs from Bali Lane, past Arab and Bussorah Streets, with a range of eateries, shisha joints and aromatic shop, selling attars (Arabic perfumes), Egyptian perfume vials, massage oils, scented body soap and shower creams.

Kampong Gelam has a tremendous amount to offer if you look closely enough - from its generational Muslim food stalls, to the Sultan Mosque where regional travelers of the old world used to visit before continuing their pilgrimage.

Several streets away from the Mosque is Haji Lane, where the pace and vibrancy goes to a new level with its colourfully painted streets and shop houses - with a feel that transforms as soon as the sun sets with its nightlife and food/drink.

There are so many surprises to be found here, a definite must visit for someone that enjoys small streets and quaint antiquity that cannot be found anywhere else on the island - infused and held up by truly passionate shopkeepers and community members.",10-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 13:56:59.151740

- Bali Lane (perpendicular to Haji Lane) is cozy. I recommend an evening at Blu Jaz or Artistry further up the road.
- Quite inconvenient for parking. Use public transport instead. (Bugis MRT station nearby, a good number of busses along either North Bridge Road or Victoria St stop near here)
- Visit the very informative Malay Heritage Centre. It is housed in a former palace, of an Anglo-Malayan design.
- Dining options: competitive, many dull ""Middle-Eastern"" restaurants, but the odd gem in the mix. Ask locals for recommendations and read reviews first.

Kampong Glam has the trappings to keep you entertained for several hours. Easy to get too (Bugis your MRT stop; a 7-minute walk thereafter), its best visited from 5pm onwards. The shops along Arab & Bussorah Streets close from 7pm onwards, so you've enough time to meander through them. As sunset approaches -- 6.55pm on -- Sultan Mosque comes alive, with the clarion call to prayer, and you people-watch as the Muslims get ready and answer this call. Walk over 1-block to Kandahar St, and you're looking at Sultan Gate and its garden; now called the Malay Cultural Heritage Centre. Historical factoid : this is where Sultan Hussein & his family were set up by Raffles & the East India Company after he signed the treaty allowing the British to establish a trading post in Singapura; which ultimately broke the Dutch's monopoly control of the SEAsian Spice trade. Walk around the area as nightfall takes grip... its past 7.30 and the area takes on an ethereal glow from the lamps illuminating the many mid-market hipster F+B outlets. Feeling peckish now? move west onto Victoria Street, and grab a bite at any of the Indian-Muslim F+B outlets facing the Sultan Mosque. Zam Zam is an old favourite, which in its heyday of the 1960s & 70s was the meeting place of many leading Arab-muslims. Loads of dishes to try..but stick with the murtabak, mee/been hoon goreng, and briyani dishes and you wont go wrong; they are simply yummy. Fancy an after-dinner stroll and a drink to cool off? Just walk 5 minutes south to Haji Lane. You've now entered into the coolest part of the Kg. Glam locale. Music, indie shops, hipster cafes, young people dressed to be noticed, all combine to make this a fitting area to grab that drink and watch rest of the evening unravel before your eyes. Kg.

I've been to this city every year for the past six years (study, work, leisure) and one spot that is NEVER missing on my go-to-places list is certainly Haji Lane. I just really, really love this little gem because it's full of narrow, artsy shops and local (as well as international) designer stores. You can always find some special gifts for friends and family or treat yourself with the fashion items and jewellery on offer- among others. The atmosphere is superb and at night CafÃ© Om (my favorite cafÃ© in SG) get's you going with fantastic live music from local artists.

Two parallel streets further is Bussorah St, where I've stayed in the Green Kiwi Hostel a few times. Directly located next to the Sultan Mosque it's THE place to make new friends while there.",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 13:58:25.971850

The trendy neighbourhood of Haji Lane and its hidden gems have shops that sells trinkets and avant-garde fashion together with bars and speakeasy such as Bar Stories.
Dessert shop Karafuru is just around the corner in Jalan Klapa and came highly recommended by a friend over coffee. The Japanese-inspired dessert bar serve some of the prettiest eclairs and parfaits Iâ€™ve seen.
At the mouth of Haji Lane thereâ€™s the prawn noodle that is out of this world.

Here it is possible as you stroll the streets to picture and imagine what life would have been like here a century or more ago for Singaporean Malays.

There are rows of terrace houses, and where they have not been defaced by modern commercial billboards and commercial signage, you can still see beautifully and intricately carved wooden windows and shutters, and often colorful tiles set into the plastered walls of the houses.

Apart from the street scene, with its many Malay restaurants, the highlights of a visit to Kampong Glam are the Sultan's Palace, Sultan's Mosque, and the former Chief Minister's House, which is now the elegant Mamanda Restaurant.",09-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 13:58:26.672136
