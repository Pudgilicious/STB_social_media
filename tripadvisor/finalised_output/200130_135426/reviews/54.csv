The weather is surprising cooling once we reached the reserve, it might be a little difficult to find a parking, but do avoid parking along the road cause there are lots of traffics and cyclists.
This time we got to see so many monkeys, it was very touching to see many Monkeys carrying their babies and the way they would hold their babies tenderly while they were moving from tree to tree.

The nature reserve opens at 7am, and the carpark at Hindhede Drive quickly fills up. We started walking up the hill, and there are folks walking up in groups, serious runners running up the hill, families strolling up, trekkers with hiking sticks, etc.

The steepest part up the hill is at the beginning, and before long, we reached the peak in no time. For this trip, we detoured to the Dairy Farm Loop Trail, which is categorised as “difficult”. This trail is indeed tough as there are quite a bit of climb and descent, and you really can see serious trekkers and runners on this trail. Nonetheless, you will also see elderly folks walking the same route and sometimes overtaking the slower ones (kudos to them)! During our visit, part of this trail (the steeper part) was only open on weekends and public holidays, so do check out National Parks Board’s website (or call them) to see whether there is any trail closure. If you go on the Dairy Farm Loop Trail, you may also want to make a small detour to the Wallace Educational Centre, formerly a cow shed.

While at the Bukit Timah Reserve, do take time to look around. During this visit, we saw a flying lemur perched on a tree, among other creatures. Visiting the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve is an excellent way to spend a couple of hours.",02-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:24:18.999195

This former KTMB railway track turned nature trail stretches from Tanjung Pagar Railway Station all the way to Woodland Checkpoint for a total distance of 24km. We trekked a small stretch of it to go to Hindhede Nature Park. We trekked to the Hindhede Quarry before continued to Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. There is a visitor Centre Exhibition at the trail head. We reached the 163.6m Bukit Timah summit using the steeper but shorter Summit Path. This path consists of near to 200 m long staircase. From the summit, we continue to trek to Dairy Farm Loop. It has the steepest climb with long flight of steps. We were trekking in the anti-clockwise direction and it is mainly descending on this Loop to finally join back to the Dairy Farm Nature Park.

Bukit Timah is the highest hill in Singapore at some 164 meters, the scene of a key battle in WW2, and today a popular exercise site.

But the real reason is to get out into nature and get a sense of the jungle, and perhaps see some wildlife.

Be warned whatever path you take to the summit you will exert yourself with some strenuous walking.

There are two paths up the hill.

A wide paved road. Fairly steep in one section. Think Old Peak Road in Hong Kong, but not that steep.

A longer narrower trail through the jungle consisting of steps. There are rope railings that provide security and balance. Since this is a narrower path in the midst of the forest, it tends to be a bit more humid that the road.

Just before the top, there is another set of stairs. This one fairly steep. There is an alternative less strenuous but longer winding path on the road. Not as steep as earlier. This path is off to the left before the stairs. There's no expansive view of the countryside at the summit as the trees and vegetation there have not been cleared.

It's also worthwhile to take the short walk through Hindhede Park to the Quarry.
Look for the hut several meters downhill by the stairs and alternative path to the summit..

The road to the left by the hut leads to the Quarry. This road is the one less traveled that will make all the difference in terms of numbers of visitors and noise The quarry is filling with water creating a lake teeming with fish and turtles. Peaceful and quiet except for the sound of the jungle.",04-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 14:25:04.253381

,1,54,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,650616788,07-02-2019,5,A Jungle At Your Doorstep,"A Casualty of War: There was a time, not that very long ago, when what’s now Orchard Road was pristine jungle, and salt-water crocs slithered up the riverbank where Clarke Quay now stands. But as jungles go in Singapore, most of them have packed and gone. Bukit Timah is the last real hilltop jungle left, but it’s no match for the ancient jungles you can still find in Borneo, New Guinea, and other undisturbed places. Less than 80 years ago, Bukit Timah itself was very disturbed: by tanks, artillery barrages, dive bombers and mortars. In little more than 12 hours—from dusk on 10 February 1942 to dawn the next morning, the Battle of Bukit Timah laid waste to what had been the most pristine bit of highland jungle Singapore had. By 0800 on 11 February, Bukit Timah’s ecosystem was shell-shocked and critically wounded. And then, for another three decades, the bukit was subjected to additional stresses, such as unrestricted vehicle traffic.

Recovery: Not all the old trees were destroyed, and some saplings that sprang up over the next decades are now mature. But don’t expect a pristine, climax tropical rain-forest. In Sumatra, we’ve been through jungle with a canopy so dense that the floor was sunless and gloomy at high noon on a cloudless day. The canopy is still patchy at Bukit Timah (see Canopy Gaps photo); perhaps in another 20 or 50 years.... Still, Bukit Timah’s jungle is seven years older than the first time I saw it, and looks a bit denser, perhaps.

Convenience: On the other hand, this is the best upland jungle that Singapore’s got, and the fact that Singapore’s got it, rather than Sarawak or Sumatra, means that it’s considerably more accessible. It’s at your doorstep (literally so, if you live in an apartment at the bottom of the bukit). Instead of spending three days reaching remote jungles up-country from Kuching or Medan, you can start hiking up Bukit Timah at high noon and be back down again by tea-time.

Ease of Ascent: Bukit Timah, as a pedestrian stroll, is much improved since seven years ago, when hikers climbed up (and even more carefully down) a steep and deeply-rutted dirt trail that was treacherous when dry and homicidal when wet. Nowadays they’ve got a well-engineered hiking path taking you up the bukit, and proper stairs with hand-ropes no less, all far safer than the former accommodations. The summit of Bukit Timah is the highest point in the entire country, but at 164 meters (538 ft), this trek is still easier than a steep climb up to the night’s camp-ground in the Alps of Switzerland, the Andes of Peru, or the auberges of Paris when their lift is out of order as usual. (However, I’ll qualify that with some cautions at the end of my review.)

Animals: The tigers of Bukit Timuh, a terror in the mid-1800s, have long since been eradicated, but pythons, pangolins and flying colugos are still up on the bukit, somewhere, as are a variety of birds such as barbets and bulbuls. In my visits to Bukit Timah, I’ve heard birds far more often than I’ve spotted them, and never encountered most of the animal species that are up there. Except macaques. On a few rare occasions, I’ve found macaques; but normally they always find me first. The macaques have turned brazen due to humans feeding them. They’re not domesticated, but their independent jungle self-sufficiency appears to be waning, while their hooliganism is waxing. I suspect the timid and skittish ones are youngsters still learning the ropes. If your primary goal is to see lots of Southeast Asian jungle animals, head to Singapore Zoo; their cousins are rather shy and retiring up on the bukit.

The Song of the Jungle: With luck, within a few minutes walk from the Visitor Centre, you’ll be surrounded by the primordial music of the jungle—the song of the cicadas. The reason you’ll need luck is that if any group of hikers is nearby—laughing, joking, and talking in loud voices--they’ll spook the cicadas (the breaking of a single twig might also silence them). Unfortunately, the odds are good that a second, and third, and fourth group of hikers will laugh and shout its way into ear-shot range, before their predecessors have completely gotten out of it. But if you’re patient, sooner or later there will be a interval between noisy bumpkins, and some brave soul among the cicadas will start vibrating its tymbals, instantly stimulating the other 100,000 or so to follow suit, and you’ll once again hear the enchanting song of the jungle. Courtesy tip: when at Bukit Timah, be as quiet as you can. Stopping occasionally and waiting motionlessly for a minute or two, will often be enough to reassure the cicadas and resume the concert.

Seclusion: Here’s Plan B for those wanting to experience the jungle without crowd noises cowing the wildlife. Since most of those loud-voiced folk stick to the main path, wander over to a secluded area, such as the overlook to the old quarry, where you might be the only one there. After you sit quietly and motionlessly for a few minutes, you’ll hear not only cicadas but other sounds as well: the rustle of younger, still-timid macaques tentatively coming down; if you’re silent and still, these novices will be a treat; if you move or make a noise, you’ll spook them (see Quarry and Macaque photos). Plan A, by the way, is to head to Bukit Timah first thing in the morning on a week-day, when locals are less likely to be there, and tourists are still breakfasting at their hotels. The Visitor Centre doesn’t open until 0830, but you can park at their lot as early as 0600. With luck, you and the wildlife will have the place to yourselves.

Vegetation: Despite birds, reptiles, insects, and mammals, the vast bulk of life on Bukit Timah is plant-life. You’ll see dense stands of rattan, safe here from the weavers who’d elsewhere be turning young rattan into baskets and mature rattan into patio furniture (see Rattan photo). You’ll spot screw pines, looking more like palms, but actually neither; they’re pandanus: their leaves are woven into mats and cordage, but from India and Ceylon across SE Asia to the Philippines, pandan’s chief virtues are culinary: it’s added to everything from biryanis and curries to tropical drinks and desserts. On younger trees of any species, expect to see stunning vines with huge leaves snaking their way up and down (see Entwined photo). On mature trees, even the vine stems hanging down may be old, gray and leaf-less: all the best photo-synthesizing action, whether for tree or vine, is high above at canopy level where the sunlight is (see Old Timer photo). All the trees here are tropical exotics that you’ll never see in temperate climes: the fragrant Gaharu used as incense, the lattice-trunked Merombong tree, the Kungkur with its massive black fruit, and the Membuluh, a splendid towering tree that occurs only in Malaysia and Singapore (see Membuluh photo). Some of these, like the Gaharu and the Membuluh, are rare almost to the point of being endangered. But if you don’t mind a bracing climb, they and a jungle-full of other exotics, can all still be seen up on Bukit Timah. The government of Singapore is an admirable custodian, and I am confident that Bukit Timah will continue to improve, unmolested, for many a decade to come.

Cautions: I wouldn’t recommend Bukit Timah to anyone with severe walking disabilities or a bad ticker. If you cannot easily walk five km (3 miles) on flat land, for any reason, you might want to refrain from trying your hand at Bukit Timah: both the slope, and the hill’s heat and humidity, could be a challenge. I’d recommend taking a water bottle per person and wearing good walking shoes (however, beverages, and toilets, are available on the trail). Avoid wildlife; even those cute macaques can have a nasty bite: a few years ago in Malaysia, a macaque actually tried its hand at eating a human, though a very small human; the meal disagreeing with it, the disappointed monkey threw the infant away with sufficient force to kill it. Wildlife is wild; the less actual contact we have with them, the better for both us and them. (For info on snakes, see my TA review of The Southern Ridges, which involved a cobra incident).",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:25:05.021406

We got here around 10am on Sunday on taxi, and it was pretty busy with many people around. It is about 10 minutes walk from the nearest MRT station - Beauty World.

First sign greeted us was the Monkeys & the Do Not Feed the Monkey signboard. The monkeys population here is not as many as Mac Retchie Reserve and seems to mind their own business.

The path to summit starts from the visitor center. There is an easier but longer trail, or shorter but more challenging train straight up from the visitor center. We picked the shortest trail which is on proper paved road but it was really steep to walk. It took us 10-15 minutes to reach the summit.

There is a shelter hut at the summit and next to it is Dairy Farm trail. It was marked as difficult walk with estimated time of 1.5 hours. The trail are mostly steep steps and it is many hundreds of steps down or up. The entire reserve are covered by tropical trees so we are sheltered from the sun throughout the walk. But other than trees, there are nothing much to see, no scenery, no animals, and hence, the average rating.

Bring water & some snacks but not a heavy backpack as it can add extra weigh when climbing the steps.

We spent about 2 hours here and headed downhill. There is a Beauty World Shopping Mall nearby the MRT and quite a lot of restaurants nearby. We even found 2 Chinese Vegetarian Restaurants and ended up trying one of them before heading home.

We had in the past, but wanted to see what changes may have been made during its closure. So, off we went.

Fortunately, when we started, it was overcast. That was a good thing since it was midday. We first started by taking a side trail at the visitors center that was a short walk to an overlook at a former quarry, now a very pretty lake. It's a pretty little walk and should not be missed.

After a quick pit stop and the purchase of some water, we tackled the main hill. It's about a 500 foot total climb to the top. But the lion's share of the ascent for this 1.3 km trail comes in the first 350 meters or so. It's a very steep ascent. After that initial climb, the slope softens quite a bit. Another 0.5 km or so brings you to a choice between taking a stairway up about 150 meters to the top, or circling around for about 0.5 km to reach the summit. We decided the stairs looked too steep to climb (an observation that was proven as we came down on the stairway and, indeed, the risers on the stairs were quite high), so we opted for the longer route.

A stone marks the summit and there is a rest hut. But there is nothing else. On both the ascent and descent, the lower parts of the trail are dotted with monkeys always eager to share any food you might drop, or be holding, so be careful around them should you happen to have good in your hand.

Make sure to bring plenty of water, as both the ascent and descen, in Singapore's heat and humidity, will quickly drain you if you're not well-hydrated.

Access has become pretty easy with the opening of the Downtown MRT line. The station is Beauty World and it's about a 20 minute ride from Bugis, the area in which we were staying.

Almost all the trails begin with the same very, steep walk up a road. This alone will defeat anyone who doesn't have a reasonable degree of fitness so be prepared and wear suitable shoes. This bit, and intact the whole of the red route to the submit can be step free so if you were really keen and very strong you could get a pram up to the top. But you'd need to be fit!

If you tack on the longer yellow ""dairy farm"" route the pram is not an option as there are frequent flights of step stairs and steps to navigate. However from the yellow route you can also add the Wallace trail which is a bit of a gem with more flora than most of the park.

Top tip on the way back is, rather than go down the steep road again, turn left onto first the catchment path then the cave path. Sure it's longer but it's also quieter and frankly nicer. Easier on your legs too.

But within the boundaries is this beautiful reserve and I thought I'd take a break from the bustle and visit. It may be small but it's still a primary rainforest!

My advice is to get there early to avoid the crowds. Try to go on the smaller paths if possible. I was very pleased to find a large group of macaques on one the paths I went down. Not many people passed so I was able to be there undisturbed. The macaques got really close but didn't beg or bother me so they haven't become too tame. Instead they seemed indifferent and didn't mind me being so close which was awesome. Getting close to monkeys without them displaying non-natural behaviour like begging was perfect.

I also got to see several monitor lizards up close. And in the old quarry lake there where a variety of fishes and turtles swimming about. The view from the top was great and the whole experience in general was fun.",05-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 14:25:55.963098

In the heart (center) of the island of Singspore and in the catchment area lies the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.

I have been waiting for the Nature Reserve to reopen for more than a year's closure for intensive repairs. The Park & Trees Board finally declare the opening two months ago. But I still find an interesting route (trail) closed. There is a sign saying the Rock Path is closed due to fallen tree. That sign was put up two months ago and they still have not remove the fallen tree. The rock path although is the shortest route other than the main road route is the most interesting and quite challenging route. You have climb a short section of rocks using your hands (and knees for some). I will write and appeal to P&T for it to be opened.

Meanwhile many who has the four trials to navigate to the summit won't miss the Rock Path.

Most visitors to the Nature Reserve especially tourist would simply walk up the main path which is actually a road although it very steep at the beginning. The main road will take you to the Summit Steps which you have to negotiate 150 m of steps to reach the summit. Alternatively you can continue to walk another 540 m to reach the top. This route from the bottom to the summit is 1.3 km.

The more adventurous will take the South View Path that will lead you to the Cave Path then to join up with Catchment Path and to the Main Road just a short distant from the Summit Steps. There are two caves here that were used during the war when the Japanese invaded Singapore.

The two routes I mentioned are easier routes from Bukit Timah side where there are good clean washroom facilities with drinking fountain at the entrance. When you approach the entrance you will find the Visitor Center with an Exhibition Hall of the profile of plant life and animals to be found in the reserve. With so much visitors per day don't dream of seeing any animals during your trek. On a weekday and in the early morning I may chance upon a jumpy squirrel, a slithering snake or monitor lizard or a bunch of chattering monkeys.

There are two more difficult routes from the Dairy Farm Nature Reserve side of the hill. Both routes are named as Dairy Farm Loops with one going on a direct route and the other an interesting meandering path that will take one and a half hours for a seasoned trekker to reach the summit.

On my good day I will be able to tackle all the four different routes but I will be bushed after that. And oh I forget to mention that there are rest points or huts along the various routes for weary trekkers and for the rain.",04-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 14:26:13.129054

This nature reserve, established in 1883, has been a botanical collection ground for more than a century, and the first known specimens of many species of Malayan plants have been obtained here.

Bukit Timah Nature Reserve was closed from September 2014 to October 2016 for restoration works. The restoration work primarily focused on bringing the forest back to the days in 1800s before Sir Stamford Raffles arrived and found Singapore.

At the same time, the restoration work also built up the many trekking trails in the reserve so that people can trek among the original vegetation and undisturbed tropical forest.

A key part of the trekking trails is to test yourself against the many different trails available.

So today, I decided to try the trail, starting from Dairy Farm Nature Park to the summit of Bukit Timah Hill.

It was tough! You will encounter a series of steep climbs up the newly created stairs to the summit. It really felt like being on a stair climber for hours at end. And some stage of the stairs need you to stretch out a fair bit. One thing good about this trek is that the thick vegetation block out most of the sunlight and it was a relatively cool trek for me. (Maybe because I started at 7:30 am and it rained the night before).

Reaching the top, the view is mostly obscured by the thick vegetation. There is a hut and a marker denoting the height of the hill. Coming down, I chose to use the shorter but steeper descent via a paved small road instead of a longer stairways down to the Visitor Center at Hindhede Road.

Please note that toilet facilities and drinking water fountains are only available at the Visitors Center at Hindhede Road and at the start of Dairy Farm Nature Park. Car parks spaces are also limited at both sites.

Also, please note that on weekends, the trekking trails and Bukit Timah Hills are especially crowded. So if you truly want to enjoy the natural primary forest, go on a workday.

I also trekked from Hindhede Road to Rail Mall on Upper Bukit Timah Road. Using the once railway corridor, this path has tall grass overgrowth on one side and the primary forest on the other, it is a peaceful walk with few fellow trekkers and mountain bikers.

Overall, the Bukit Timah Hill and the surrounding nature reserve is a good break from the concrete jungle and the hustle and bustle that is Singapore.",01-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 14:26:13.849322

We took the difficult path up to challenge ourselves. It was not easy going for the untrained body but we kept the pace slow and steady, resting when we needed. But it was enjoyable to walk amongst the cool foliage well thought-of paths. We could see many fruit trees (rambutans and chempedak) and the resident monkeys having their breakfast amongst the trees. Being a weekend, it was rather crowded, so a visit during the weekday would be more peaceful for those who’s prefer that.",07-2019,Friends,2020-01-30 14:27:12.175521
,1,54,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Gajahgoogoo,691908344,23-07-2019,5,Escape from the city,"I love love love trekking at Bukit Timah Hill and have brought lots of friends here too. The hill is only 163.63m high, but because its very small, the route to the summit is fairly steep. And you can gain more elevation by taking the dairy farm loop and the jungle falls path after the summit that will bring you on trails that loop down and up the side of the hill.

Many people (especially on weekends) walk straight up the paved road to the summit, but even on a busy weekend, once you're on one of the trails, you leave the crowds behind. The trails were pretty busy this morning, and by that I mean that we saw / passed perhaps 20 other people (say 8 to 10 groups) in the hour that we were walking.

My regular route starts with the South View Path (first right off the paved road about 10m past the toilets). Its really more efficient to go straight up the paved road but to me, much more pleasant in the trails. Oh yes, speaking of toilets, do what you need to do before starting your climb, as there are no toilets at the summit. The toilets are clean and generally stocked with toilet paper, and there'e even an area to wash mud off your shoes post-trek if you need it. There are also no drinks at the summit so this is your last chance to drink (if you didn't bring any water along) until you come back down.

Stay on South View Path and it will segue into Cave Path, passing 2 cave entrances on your left. Then you'll hit a T-junction, take a left to bring you back to the paved road to the summit. In case you're wondering, going right will bring you out of the hill to an open rolling route parallel to the Bukit Timah Expressway along the water pipeline that eventually leads to Malaysia. The path will lead first to Dairy Farm, and eventually to ZhengHua Nature Park. You can walk to Dairy Farm then rejoin the Bukit Timah Hill route, but this route is alot sunnier and less jungle-y.

K, anyway, back to the trail. You will emerge from the trail onto the paved road towards the summit. Turn right, and soon after you'll reach a fork in the road. Take the right fork (the left leads to a dead end - the top of a quarry and a power station). a minute or two after that you are offered a choice or either continuing on the paved path or the summit path, a set of stairs that is the ""short cut"" to the summit. This is the preferred route of course :D

When you emerge from the Summit Path, the summit will be in front of you. Stop to take the obligatory photos. Now you can follow the path back down, or you can start the trek proper :) Which involves taking the first right into the trails as you walk down the paved road from the summit, into Rengas Path. The first part of this trail consists of large steps. About midway down you can choose to start on a path or continue down the stairs. Keep going down. You're now on the Diary Farm loop, All you have to remember is that when you hit the Dairy Farm Hut (I think the first hut on this post-summit trail), the Dairy Farm loop takes you through the hut and out the back. (If you don't go into the trail, you will end up at Dairy Farm, and you can get back to the start point by walking back along the water pipes (but stay out of the parallel mountain bike track) til you get back to the Cachement Path I mentioned earlier. Yes its easier, but you don't get to see why some people carry hiking poles onto Bukit Timah Hill.

OK, back to the path behind Dairy Farm loop. It will eventually take you up the steepest set of stairs on the Hill. A gentleman I met on the trail today said there are 288 steps. Which doesn't sound that bad, until you see the size of each step. I prefer to keep my head down and just take on step at a time.

Keep following the trail and you will reach a wooden platform with the option to either continue straight, to turn to the right onto another trail - this is the Jungle Falls path (which brings you past not a waterfall, but a stream. This used to be my favourite walk as its the most ""natural"", but Nparks is in the process of laying steps and rope banisters there. On the one hand, I do understand - it protects the trees and I suppose makes it safer for walkers - but I am a little sad about it. Anyway, you can't get lost on this route. Enjoy the walk... past the ""jungle fall"" you will reach the last set of stairs followed by about 150m of trail before emerging back on the paved path. Most people will turn right and continue down the paved path to the bottom of the hill. You can also turn left and back up to the summit and head down via the summit path steps.

If you really don't like the path, then look out for the Kruing path on the left (if you pass the Kruing Hut you've missed the path) - that will take you on a parallel path in the trail that will emerge where you started, at the start of the south view path near the visitors centre and the toilets.

I had once visited here when my children were young, holding their hands up the steep slope. I had also visited here with my childhood friends and remembered our sports shoes were dirtied with mud after an adventurous walking trail filled with mud. This time I am here with my team of grassroots leaders and it was our first time coming back after the nature reserve has renovated.

Our coach driver seem new to this place and drove us right near the car park of the visitor center and having a hard time maneuvering his way out thereafter. It would be advisable that passengers alight a distance from the car park and walk a short distance to the visitor center if you are coming by bus.

When we arrived at the visitor center and was taking our photo at the landmark rock at the visitor center, a CISCO guard came and advised me to register at the counter since we are a big group of 33. He explained to me that we should have notified NParks in advance if we are visiting the place as a group. I apologized for my ignorance and wrote down the name of my grassroots organization on the register. So, if you are bringing a full bus load of residents, please notify NParks in advance.

We decided to do some warm up exercises before proceeding up the hill. One of my members led the warm up exercises. She switched on her hand phone with some music playing to add in fun for the warm up exercises. This time, another CISCO guard approached us after we had finished with our warm-up exercises and told us that music playing is prohibited at the nature reserve. He did not explain the reason just told us it is a rule which we should not violate. Again, I had to apologize for my ignorance.

Despite these early hiccups, the journey up the hill was exhilarating and refreshing. I sweated profusely as my heart pounded at the most arduous steep slope up to the summit. But it was just a short slope up. It is nothing compared to the multiple long flight of stairs when you are scaling up the mountains in China be it Taishan, Ermeishan or even the Great Wall of China.

Up at the summit, we took some group photos and commenced our mission impossible: Anti-littering picking and First Aid refresher training. We are a group of First Aiders and we seized this opportunity of outing to revise and refresh our first aid training: refreshing our knowledge on the various bandages for the different types of injuries and wounds and performing the right method of applying CPR. What emergency steps to take if we are being bitten by snakes or accidentally ate a poisonous fruit while doing trekking in a forested area. We had two members who are retired nurses and they were so keen to share their experiences and demonstrate the various first aid techniques. The whole sharing took us about 45 mins and everyone had their hands on.

After the first aid training, we took our thongs and commenced our anti-littering picking activities with our trash bags. The areas at the summit was perfectly clean except for some little papers here and there. There were many visitors on that weekend but we hardly see much litters along the way. Occasionally, someone dropped some little papers along the way up and we were happily picking them up. The message we are sending to our members is Love our parks and gardens and it is our duty to maintain it clean and green. All of us love nature, love the fresh air, love the green and beautiful scenery and we have to play our part in keeping this country clean at all times.

We came at about 8 am and completed our two missions and was at the base at about 10 am. We then walked a short distance to Hindhede Quarry and took few beautiful shots at the site.

As we brisk walked our way to have our meals at Bukit Timah Hawker Center, we were laughing and whistling. It was a great memorable bonding outing and a meaningful day out to perform outdoor learning and keeping our park clean and green.

The entrance was already clogged with cars and hikers, in various shades of attire and with varying degrees of rowdiness. Toilet and drinking water facilities here, then hit the tarmac trail heading up the slope. It hits you immediately - an unrelenting gradient upwards on the trail, then you hit a choice of even steeper stairs, or a more gradual but longer progression on tarmac.The summit was reached after about 20 mins slog, but was unrewarding - no view, and a small information centre. There are numerous other trails branching off - but although BKNR is a small acreage, trails are challenging because what goes down.. must come up (if you want to go home the same way). We continued on the Dairy Farm loop - headed quite steeply downhill, and gradually descended until we reached the information centre near the Wallace trail. We then returned the same way (getting progressively more breathless), and at the summit, descended via tarmac trail to save the knees. Good points: you get a cardio workout, and the trees and verdant greenery arching above is beautiful. Downsides: be prepared to share the reserve with hundreds of other humans, some lycra'd and jogging the trails, others out for a noisy morning bonding session.

The area was an excellent practicing ground especially for amateurs like me. Well-maintained amenities like toilets, water points and vending machines filled with thirst quenching isotonic drinks.

What I love about the area is the different trekking sections to cater for hikers of different needs. For trekkers/hikers, there are 4 different difficulty levels of routes, ranging from easy paved flat ground to challenging forest trail filled with muscles punishing steps. And for mountain bikers, there is also a Mountain Biking Trail for that adventure pumped journey. Most importantly, after a sizeable investment to revamp the area, most of the routes are designed in a way to provide adequate safety and rest points so to minimize chances of getting hurt while perspiring out with a healthy lifestyle.

Toilet facilities are available at starting point visitor centre. Suggest to use the toilet as there is none at the summit (there are toilet facilities at Wallace Education Centre along the dairy farm loop, yellow trail). Maps and direction signs are available at strategic locations. Hence it is easy to navigate around.

There are 4 main routes, from Easy to Difficult level. If you are generally fit, I suggest that you hike the longer, slightly difficult yellow trail. I did the yellow trail to the north-most Dairy Farm Hut.
