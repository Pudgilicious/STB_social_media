I was very excited to see exhibition because I had already seen the one in Japan. But very disappointed. May be because I've already seen the best one that is 10000 times better. The Disney animation is just a maze of sketches of how the cartoons are sketched out. And the future world also sorry but we just wanted to get over and out of it. Only the Crystal room was very pretty we went in twice to see it. The rest was useless.,12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 13:59:02.476441

I thoroughly enjoyed making my own fish and vehicle and see it come to life on the big screen.

Suitable for young children as well as young adults.Lots of photo opportunities! If you’re a Disney fan I would also recommend visiting the Disney Magic of Animation exhibition.

This lotus inspired, ingeniously named 'ArtScience Museum' is
privately owned by the Marina Bay Sands Group, who own the casino and hotel of the same name.
Feng Shui is said to play an important hand in the design here and it literally does! Surely you can visualise the shape of a palm seemingly grasping or trying to contain something. Probably the hefty 19sgd entrance fees, LOL.
The ArtScience Museum is far from being a proper museum per say, as are the Singapore National Museum, Art Museum and Science Centre, which are the real deal. Yes, there are often free exhibitions in collaboration with who's who, that are worthy of a visit here if you so happen to be in the neighbourhood. This is just one section perhaps dedicated to the subject of Arts and Science which is free. This in turn tempts one into imagining what's to see in the paid section of the ArtScience Museum. Many assume there should be more of the same, only better. Yet it is the actual ArtScience Museum that one gets dissapointed with and anyone who reads the grouses on on TripAdvisor should know if this is really their scene.
Do not expect the ArtScience Museum to be at all like Singapore's mainstream museum. This is pretty much a OTT children's amusement centre in technicolor. Albeit, a fusion one at best. Not at all recommended for anyone above fourteen years of age.
The only adults you will find inside the ArtScience Museum is likely to fall into one of the categories below. They would be :
1. Tourist's who believed it was Museum of Art & Science. (They would be the unhappy in expressing their views here)
2. Extroverts on social media chasing the selfies and instagram likes. ( Because it might be raining outside or they have nothing currently worthy to post)
3. Parents/Grandparents (myself included) who accompany the young children. (They will be looking for the true art and science section of this museum only to find none)
It is claimed the future is created here at the ArtScience Museum, but all I felt the entire time, was like I was walking thru a long psychedelic kaleidoscope. In all fairness thou, my fourteen month old grandson enjoyed himself here immensely attracted by all the movements and colors.
Entertainment for some perhaps, but certainly not Science and if at all it is deemed as Art, it is Art without much content.
Go if a myriad of moving projected images of luminous technicolor on the floor, walls, ceilings and slides is your kinda playground. Yes, that's right, there are two slides and I betcha this is the only museum with a indoor slide in the world.
Older children who enjoy illustration can have their works projected on the walls while there and that's about as arty as it gets. Activities for the children will keep them occupied in a low light environment for some time without parents ever having to worry about sun stroke.
Do remember to bring a camera for low light photography as no flash photography is allowed. One exits by walking thru a prism of blinding bright white LED lights set against mirrors. The grand finale of harsh lights to walk thru was a Christmas overload.
Overall an entertaining time for young children. Hopefully, future playgrounds will not be as dark and mindless as this self proclaimed museum!",11-2019,Family,2020-01-30 13:59:04.185188

Alice was disappointing- interesting only to kids/grownups who really like and know the story since it is mostly artifacts. And very little interactive - the kids where all disappointed after 45 minutes waiting line.

We did the full exhibit tour and there were three open when we were there. The really wasn't any science link to any of them, but the one on balloons did try to add some technical aspects. There were several high-tech video installations, but all the focus was on visuals and not the underlying technology. Our daughters enjoyed the interactive drawing parts and playing with the balls that change color based on how fast they are going, but as other reviewers say, there isn't much of particular interest for adults. The Wonderland exhibit was heavily hyped, but it was mainly a presentation of all the books/movies based on the story so more history than anything else.

Compared to government-owned museums (like the National Gallery or Asian Civilisation Museum), this one has the highest price AND the lowest amount of interesting content. The current three exhibitions are enjoyable for young children below 22 years old. Otherwise, they are just collections of low-operating-costs (or even low set-up costs) items. Yet, because of the high appeal to young children, queues can be quite long on weekends. Sometimes, farting can made queuing quite toxic. No wonder Japanese tourists keep their masks on.

They especially loved coloring their pictures and seeing them come to life up on the wall. Aside from a few extra activities, this one was very similar to TeamLab Future Park in Fukuoka.

The Wonderland exhibition is one for fans of Alice in Wonderland. While my husband and I enjoyed it, having grown up reading it and seeing various versions of the movie, our kids were not ‘wowed’ by this exhibition.

If you’ve got the time to see visit this museum, I certainly recommend it.

Anywy, we went ahead with my assumption and proceed with Alice first. Then we wento for lunch, and went back for Future and Utopia.

Alice in wonderland is ok if u have little kids in tow. But the tea party, very unfriendly staff (guy). Maybe the guy assumes everyone knows the rules. Tsk tsk, he even argued to one tourist. He is askng for 4 more people to take seats, the foreigner group is 3, so basically she can. But its like he shooed them away, until the girl argued...then they were able to take the seats.

The Future World exhibition was cool, innovative and educational. The kids loved the interactive segments and enjoyed themselves. Wonderland, however, promised much, but was not really up to par. Sure, the exhibits on original literary works of Lewis Caroll and videos of first ever live adaptions of the classic story was interesting, but there seemed to something missing. The map provided also had riddles to keep the kids busy while they maneuvered the exhibitions but they soon lost interest.

We actually bought our tickets through Klook but realized our mistake after we saw a sign saying that on that particular day children could enter free of charge. But we did take advantage of this by buying adult tickets at the ticket office for Wonderland and the children got in free.

We started with Future World which my kids went craxy about. My wife and I also had terrific fun. We coloured in pictures of cars, rocket ships, buses and trucks and then scanned them into a machine and the next moment our drawings were floating across a huge screen on roads. We must have spent about half an hour playing around here.

There are several activities like this, another with butterflies where you can touch them on the screen and they fall down. And another where you colour in things and they are displayed moving across the screen. I have to say this again, that my young children had an absolutely brilliant time. I believe there were about six or seven activities here and they were all fun.

The second attraction here was Wonderland with an Alice in Wonderland theme. This could involve adults more than the previous attraction and was enormous fun. It included exploring different areas and looking for clues and doing several other activities. The one we enjoyed the most was having a photo taken of our faces and then seeing ourselves as a playing card with arms and legs and our silly faces bouncing around across a large screen.

So as a place to bring young children I would say definitely visit the ArtScience Museum. For young couples or couples with a good sense of fun then you will also have fun here too. The visit was really worth it and was one of the highlights of our trip.",05-2019,Family,2020-01-30 13:59:30.644402

I won't recommend this place for family with young children if there was no children friendly exhibition. My children have gone to many museums before. They went to museums or exhibutions in Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, small ones in Venice, Vicenza, Kobe etc you get the point and they were in awe with everything but my 4 yo said she didn't like the museum upstair except for the clock. Will try National Gallery next. But... I like this small museum a lot. Don't know what will improve their ratings among families with really young kids.

I made one there and printed the rest to take back to the hotel to do later. They won't survive the suitcase home but were fun to make.

It's an extraordinary museum that you have to see, especially for family with young children. Kids will be happy and enjoy visiting here. The ambience itself makes you comfortable to be here for long duration.

How to get here?
The best way for me to get here is using MRT, to Bayfront Station. When you arrive in Bayfront MRT station, there will be clear direction either you want to go to Garden by The Bay, or to Marina Bay Sands. Follow direction to Marina Bay Sands.
In the other hand, the MRT station itself has direct connection to Marina Bay Sands. So, you will walk along the direction with fully air conditioned area.

After reaching the Marina Bay Sands, you will see direction to ""Museum"", follow it. The museum is easy to find and located outside Marina Bay Sands.

What can you do here?
The museum has some exhibitions which divided into permanent and temporary exhibitions. I was visiting double exhibitions : Future World and Marvel Studio. Although they are small, but worth enough to be visited

Future world is a permanent exhibition which combine art and technology by Team lab. This is the best place for children and adult. Your children will be excited to play light ball in the park, drawing fish/car and put it into the screen, sliding, and any other else. The ambience is very comfortable to let children play and for parents while waiting them playing.
Unfortunately, the crystal universe was renovated during my visit here.

Second exhibition that I was visited is Marvel Studios (10 years of Heroes) which only several steps from Future World Exit.
Marvel Studios is a temporary exhibitions that was informed will be ended at Sept 30th 2018. This exhibitions very amazing. You can see the history of each heroes also their statue which really similar with the real one. You can see Iron Man's costume changing, Dancing Groot, Captain America's ship, etc. They also play short Marvel's movie. Don't forget to take picture with all Marvel's movie cast.

☉ When is the best time to go here?
Morning - Afternoon

What is the best outfit?
I am not suggest you to wear specific outfit.
You can wear fashionable dress while taking pictures in Crystal Universe or Future World or any clothes that comfort you

The exhibition was good as it's standard, fit the place perfect esp. the main high-light hall.

But the worst thing happened when my son was stopped from a staff when he was carefully moving the beast (experiment zone) as he is too small and can't move 'her' smoothly, and again when the small group lecture come (only 2 people with booking?), then we need to leave as we run out of time to the airport.

I was admired the place as it's part of shopping mall, great ideal to connect people with art as apart of life but now this art seems to unreachable like it was before or still in some developing country...

My son seems to lost his interest on the main highlight but still making his own beast by lego (he is 7 year olds) Luckily when staff said 'No, you can't do it!' doesn't haunting him.",07-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:00:15.128797

things we did: virtual aquarium where you color the type of sea creature you want, scan your work, and then wait for it to appear in their wall-sized screen aquarium, The trick is to scan scan scan so you see your art work in the form of a school! hahahhaha

The same gist for the cityscape except you choose between cars, trucks, buildings, and planes.. try the buildings since they stay on the screen and twirl for you whenever you poke them

Light room that tells a story on the walls, ceiling, and floor... amazing!

Although we have been living in Singapore ever since the Musuem opened, this was our first visit. Rather than forcing a visit on our son, we felt it was better to wait until he was ready.

So we were pleasantly surprised when he expressed keen interest in trying out something new and pointed to the Art and Science Musuem while surfing TripAdvisor.

First of all, I must say the location of ASM itself is a big attraction. The promenade is simply breathtakingly gorgeous. We the population of Singapore really are very lucky to have such a beautiful landscape to enjoy, completely free!

ASM made quite a splash when it opened with a unique lotus styled architectural design. All of which had no meaning as we settled into a fun day between dad and son. The musuem itself is quite small and probably doesn’t need more than half a day to tour. My son was so enthralled with the Marcel Studios exhibition (no surprise there given all the Marvel Comics superheroes are ruling the roost these days) that we went there twice! But importantly we also enjoyed the Future World exhibits with the computer generated graphics for ocean waves, the mathematically accurate water fall and almost real looking aquarium. So also, the Wind walkers exhibit and Theo Jansen’s work was a big hit with all the strandbeest creations from PVC pipes. Lessons learnt includes global warming and the rise of sea levels as well as Singapore’s response to rising sea levels (hope the lessons stick!)

The ‘In the Wild’ rainforest game was a hit too; spotting mouse deers, pangolins, tapirs and saving the rainforest from fire all in a day’s work.

The most inspiring is the Futureworld exhibit where technology and art meets and conspire to blend in with our imagination.

The other exhibits are fairly well done also, the street art something new to us.

If you need to choose just one exhibit, go for the Futureworld. Else if you have time and budget to spare, keep an open mind and support the rest also.

Overall an enjoyable experience for the entire family.",03-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:00:52.499204

We bought the family group tickets (2 adults, 2 kids), because it was cheaper than buying 2 adults & 1 kid tickets. I hope one day, the museum management would consider having a family package with the option of 1 child.
First, we went to the Future World section, which was AMAZING! Our son had so much fun and did not want to leave. There were so much learning activities which were fun and engaging! The staffs were there on the look out for the safety of the children and very helpful.

Then we went to the Treasures of the Natural World, where there were so many historical specimens to look at. My son, who is so fascinated by dinosaurs and fossils, was in awe of all those pre-historical animal bones.

The street art exhibition was lovely and interesting too! It was a great combination of some brought-in pieces as well as art that were done directly on the wall!

We also enjoyed watching the short video clips they were showing on the very top floor of the building. It was very delighting to see some bean bags and lazy chairs to make viewing enjoyable and relaxing.

I love that the museum limits how many visitors can enter per half hour; it enhances the experience that kids can run freely and enjoy everything without sitting through crowds. My 3-year-old spent 2 happy hours there and could have continued; at bedtime, he said his favorite part of the day was drawing fish that entered the animated aquatic world.

Future World is a truly innovative kids’ museum— unlike anything I’ve ever seen!

We also walked through Treasures of the Natural World, which made my jaw drop. I learned so much, and I was amazed that the specimens were authentic! There was just enough hands-on interaction to keep my kid entertained.

Kids LOVED it.,"We needed something to do on a rainy day with our 10, 7 and two 5 year olds and came to the Museum almost by chance. As luck would have it, is was a Friday and up to four children enter free with one paying adult. We therefore decided to visit both the Futureworlds and the National Treasures exhibit. The kids were totally entranced by the Futureworld exhibit. We spent over 2 hours in there and had to drag the kids away for lunch. The installations are very interactive and pitched at children 4-12. A lot of the exhibition involves colouring in drawings which the kids can then scan. The drawings then become part of the installation. The kids were fascinated by this and did dozens of drawings. The other installations are also very appealing to children. Each exhibit is one-time entry only, so after finishing Future World we went to the nearby Food Court at Marina Bay Sands for lunch (a few minutes walk). As luck would have it we returned just before 3pm when there was a free guided tour of the Natural Treasures exhibit. The guide was excellent and because it was ""Family Friday"" pitched the tour at the kids. It was very interesting and informative. The tour took about 45 minutes and then we spent a further 15 minutes looking at the exhibits. We may return another day to do the free ""Into the Wild Tour"". (Looked like it involved some sort of tablet device). We would definitely recommend the Museum for families with young children (especially on Family Friday).",01-2018,Family,2020-01-30 14:01:02.825669

She was so right! We ended up spending up more than 3 hours at the gallery, which is actually fairly small. When you enter you are quite unsure of what to expect but very soon you are taken in by the high-tech interactive installations. Many of them offer you a chance to create something of your own (digitally) and the others either encourage you to play (the fruit slide was our favorite!) or be wowed (the space exhibit at the end). The game of creating a digital town using the blocks on a table was my son's favorite, he really loved it. The Sketch Aquarium was another fun activity. He also spent a lot of time with the huge balls that change in colour as you move them around, it is also supposed to change the music but this effect was not very clear (given how much the kids were shouting). It may not be a lot of fun if you don't have a younger one with you (given the entry ticket is quite steep), but i would still recommend to pay a visit, it is in many ways eye-opening, at least for me it was a sampling of a possibly not so distant sci-fi future.",12-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:01:03.855295

Upon entry we were asked if we would like to leave our stroller outside as there was stroller parking. We declined as we thought our little one may take a nap.

Once we entered we were ushered into a screening of Crows, a 3D projection mapping video of Crows in flight. Was nice to watch in a dark room. Even our 9 month old watched the entire thing which only lasted a few minutes.

Then we checked out a tidal waves projection. You can laze on the beanbags and watch it, take photos or just relax. Our baby kept going to the wall with the projection hoping to catch a wave.

Then came the fruit and flower field slide. This is a big hit for kids, as they get to slide down a giant slide with fruits and flowers projections. Many kids went on the slide again and again.

The entire exhibition used lighting technology and projection mapping. You can colour in images of sea animals, images of buildings etc and immediately get it projected on the floor, wall or ceilings. It's really fun. You get lots of colours and creativity from everyone.

There was an area which had LED cubed bricks to play with. Also another with LED Balls. My 9 month old baby was crawling everywhere and pulling herself up on the bricks and balls. She had such a good time.

The exhibit ends through a crystal universe which is really pretty and great for photos. You can't take a stroller through the crystal room though. Something to take note of if you plan to take your stroller into the exhibition. Although my recommendation is leave the stroller outside at stroller parking. This exhibition is highly entertaining and interactive. No kid or baby will want to be in the stroller through it. You will just end up lugging it everywhere.

As a Sands Reward Club member, I am entitled to receive a free adult ticket for every adult ticket purchased, up to two every month.
On Fridays, up to four children are entitled to enter the Museum free of charge for every adult ticket purchased. The staff were obstinate that I couldn't receive the free tickets for my two children. This is despite that there is no term or condition that prevents this. They stated that it would be combining offers or promotions. Yet this is something that surely would have been contemplated and explicitly excluded, but is definitely not. Maybe I am the first person to do this. They argued back and forwards, but refused to have a senior manager come speak to me. Its a Singaporean thing!

However, the shnorrer in me was not going to back down.

Eventually a manager did come after an hour. I had one question for her; what is the cost of an ""All Access"" adult ticket on Fridays with the free children's tickets when paying with my NETS card? the answer was SGD$38.00 less 15% equals SGD$32.30. You see, in September there was a special of 15% discount with the NETS card.

Ah Ha! I had them and they knew the game was up. This is because it would be combining offers or promotions which they had wrongly and incessantly argued.

We went to all the exhibitions and completed the tour in a little over two hours.
Great for children, not too long or in depth. They weren't bored at all.

We actually wanted to go for the free exhibit, Into The Wild, but sadly it was closed for renovation when we were there. I would say that FutureWorld is really good fun, not just for kids but adults as well. Besides the slide (which is awesome fun), there are many interactive activities whereby anyone can have fun, such as an animation game on a table, colouring in your creations to have them show up on the screen, placing blocks on a table and watch how it affects the city, etc. There are beautiful blocks that are lighted up in different colours, which are great for phototaking.
Both my hubby and I were utterly disappointed with HUMAN+, as the content shown was not what we have expected, and somehow the presentation was dull and boring. In effect, it took us less than an hour to finish appreciating the entire HUMAN+ exhibition, and it's not cheap too.
Overall, FutureWorld is worth a visit but I wouldn't say the same for HUMAN+.",07-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:01:29.763402

My grandchildren found 'Sketch Town' the most engrossing activity as they could draw or colour in trucks or planes or other shapes, pass them through a colour copier/computer which then incorporate their image into Sketch Town. It was very exciting for them to see their drawings as part of the activity on the large screen. I found the 'Crystal Universe' a spectacular finale to my visit to the exhibition.

I bought the accesses for all 3 exhibits - future world, serpentiform and human +. On the himdsight, for them, I should have just bought the future world only. I dont think it is a place for adults especially if you go without any kids. Future world will be more for kids. adults can however explore other exhibits instead.

As this is kind of the first time we visited such place, they were truely amazed. We did not go to MOSH! before hence they went there without expectation. when they first inside, they thought there are just relaxing with the waves. But they gotten excited when the saw the slides and the interactive town.

That was not all! They saw people colouring and wanted to colour instead. and the surprize came after they scannes their pictures and send them to the floor. they were a bit difficult to find them though.

The highlight is the sketch town which they colour and scan them. They could find their truck and car on screen. They had great fun hunting and moving with their car. The other highlight for them is the scanning into 3D craft. They spent sometime doing the craft there but really enjoyed themselves and they wanted to do more. The disappointing part is that the 3d craft is only for the sketch town picture but not under water world and nature theme. But sketch town has quite a lot of pictures to draw and scan already!

For the colourful big balls, safety aspects can probably be improved. My girls were complaining about people knocking them etc but I will take it that they will need to take care of themselves more and be careful when playing.

The hopscotch was intially not a fan for them but after another round.. they were excited to created it. But so much in jumping but to have their names appeared on the wall.

Space was another area which they liked. But there was only 1 terminal and my hp batt was running low. there were other people/ adults hogging on the terminal which did not give them the chance to create their universe.

Human + was disappointing (except for talking to the robot) but they did have so fun in the serperntiform when they were haunting for the snake with ipad and creating a snake for them to control or dance.

Overall great place for kids and if going with kids, just go for future world will do. The 'fun' in other exhibits did not justify the cost.

You will have to walk a fair distance through a building and a plaza to get to it's entrance, but it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes depending on your walking speed. We purchased tickets inside, but the best deals we heard were from a City-Wide ticket tour package that you can buy at the municipal government building and online too. The museum had a lot of interesting exhibits you could walk through. The best activities though were an interactive area where you, and/or your children could draw vehicles on paper, then a machine would scan them and they would join all of the other vehicles motoring around on a giant projection of a cartoon city. It was fun looking for your own creation. There were several other interactive exhibits like that as well.

They change the exhibit slightly over time, so that your experience can be new when you go a second time. It is a really hands on interactive exhibit, you can relax on a beanbag whilst walls display beautiful images, you can colour in drawings of animals/vehicles which you then scan in and see come alive on the floor and walls, you can have flowers grow at your feet where you stand, you can go down a slide that make sounds and colours as you slide down it, you can turn you coloured in drawing into a 3D model, you can play with giant inflatable balls that change colours and make sounds, you can make your own hopscotch that you can then play, it's an immersive light and sound exhibition... we loved it, and we're grown ups, so I can't even imagine how exciting children must find this FutureWorld exhibit, definitely worth the admission fee. It's not for everyone, but if you have a playful childlike side to your personality then I would imagine you will love it.

However, I can't be as passionately excited about the Human+ or the Universe & Art exhibitions... perhaps it is just because they are not to my taste/interests. I found the Human+ exhibition very weird and odd, although some bits were interesting, other bits were kinda depressing or a little gruesome/morbid, the best part would be the realistic robot at the end who you can talk to and have a conversation with, my parents enjoyed this exhibition more than I did, so it might just not be suited to me. The Universe and Art exhibit wasn't really found interesting by myself or my parents, we just didn't really like it to be honest, the art was not at all to my taste, there was a video of dancing/floating in zero gravity, that is the thing I remember the most, and I wasn't particular fussed by seeing that.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:01:55.112162

The Chasing Crows and Black Waves were both awesome. Sketch Town was so cool, I couldnt't help but draw/color my own spaceship which was later scanned and became part of the 3D Town. We also loved the Story of Time... where you can touch hieroglyphics and see them transform into animals like tiger and elephant. My son was so amazed at the Crystal Universe. He loved how he was able to manipulate the lights and sounds using a touchscreen to create an illusion of dancing stars. We really enjoyed the whole exhibit. The only drawback was that camera flash was not allowed. I wasn't able to take a decent shot with my Iphone.

Really impressed that the ArtScience Museum was able to organize so many good quality exhibitions. The toddler was enthralled by the replicas of life-sized astronaut suits at the ticketing counter, and we were tempted to get all the NASA-related memorabilia, but alas, we settled for Future World Exhibition for the sake of the little one.

There were 16 exhibits here. We loved the:
- big slide of an entrance into this ""gigantic playground""
- letting our child design trucks, buildings etc gives meaning to this doodling play, as though letting them have a taste of architecting the future Singapore city
- slightly mind-challenging transportation/river building table play that encourages the young minds (and ours, the adults') to create
- the beautiful waterfall and fishes on the ground... interactive and rather hypnotic to be honest
- the hop-scotch music mat was the absolute favourite of my toddler and so many other older kids I saw queuing for their turn
- the colour-changing blocks and big bouncy balls... what can I say, the kids just cannot leave them. Pretty, mindless fun. Best part is the comfortable leather-cushioned enclosure for this play area that the adults can relax on while the kids roll around on the balls

It was a long queau as the picture below shows...50 odd people ahead of us. Pace of queau movement was really slow. Obviously it's good to have a crowd. But on a holiday (1st May) can't see how the organisers had only one counter open with a relatively inefficient t person behind the tills.

Kids (and adults) will get a kick out of seeing their pic animated on the big screen.

Note that two of the rooms were closed when we went so there is reduced pricing of $7 per adult. We probably spent about 2 hours at the museum.

It was a very quiet, dark space for kids to be creative, and to be more mindful.

There is also a free interactive activity using a tablet which requires you to follow a path, find some animals and plant seeds, followed by a 6 minute video. Note you do need photo id for each person that wants a tablet.

There is a mall with a great food court next door to the museum.

My kids, ages 11, 8, and 5, all really enjoyed the Future World exhibit, were lukewarm about NASA and didn't really enjoy the art exhibit.

I'd avoid the art exhibit in the future with kids of this age group - just not enough ""engagement"" for them. That said, the kids thoroughly enjoyed the Future World exhibit. It really was a well-done amalgamation of art and science...and we would probably have spent the whole day there if not for the parents noting that there was more to see elsewhere in the museum! In Future World, the museum has done a great job creating a few similar areas where patrons can create artwork and then see their creations ""come to life"" on large viewing screens, all part of a larger display/interaction with other patrons' work. The displays were a floor ecosystem, a village, and a seascape. There were other interesting interactive activities as well, all helping to blur the line between art and science.

The NASA exhibit is very professionally-done. It's been awhile, but it reminded me of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibits in Washington DC. I enjoyed it as an adult but it was unfortunately a little too much reading and too little interaction for kids of our age.

The museum was very busy when we arrived at around noon on a Friday. Families may consider arriving earlier in the day and buying tickets online.

On the contrary, it has exceeded itself in its recently opened ""Future World"" permanent exhibition. This exhibition alone makes the museum a wiorthy visit. Divided into easily navigable themes-nature, park, town and space, each interactive zone stimulates and provokes thought on the interaction between msn and his environment.
Eminently appealing to kids for the superior visual and digital technology, the exhibition speaks to adults too as a place for (not too quiet) reflection on one's place under the sun.
It is best to go when the crowds are less to fully appreciate all that ""Future World"" has to offer. We booked the 10 am ('first）slot and that was great because by the time we finished at noon, the place was packing it in. The 8 year old in our group enjoyed it so much she declared that she wanted to come to Singapore to work here!

But The Future World exhibit proved me wrong. Upon entry this exhibit immediately transported me into a dreamlike world. The lights and sounds combined to create an effect that enveloped me into a cocoon of wonderment. My description will not do it justice, you must step in to experience it.

The combination of lights, sounds, music, touch, movement effectively create a tranquil and beautiful world which I found hard to let go.

We had fun coloring our own spaceship and watch our creation come to life on the huge screen.

The Crystal Universe is a sight to behold. Watch as millions of lights change colors, rhythms, directions & speeds to sync with the music and be lost in your own world. I could stay there the whole day...

And, make sure you don't miss the room with the ocean waves... ahhh...

The Big Bang Data Exhibit is very informative but a tad too geeky for my interest.

The Van Kleef and Arpels The Arts and Science of Gems Exhibit features lots of luxurious gems and jewelry. If you are into such luxuries, you are in for a treat. For my party and I, the place pales in comparison to the Future World Exhibit.

The show was beautifully set up with the jewels and other exhibits displayed in clear tubes, spheres and cubes so you can get up close and view many of the exhibits from all sides. And photography was allowed as long as no flash was used.

Security was posted everywhere - as can be expected - but were unobtrusive.

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves oohing and ah-ing over the collections. The free souvenir program handed out at the entrance is a beautiful keepsake. Thank you ArtScience Museum for the gift.

I do, however, have 1 piece of feedback to ArtScience Museum. I logged on to buy tickets online but abandoned my cart as the process asked for too much information in my opinion.

As a visitor, I want to buy tickets as a guest. I do not want to register for, or need an account. A mobile number is useful for you to contact me should shows be cancelled, but not every visitor will have a mobile. Also, why is it mandatory for me to provide my email, my date of birth and my passport number? How is it relevant to my buying tickets to view an exhibit. And why should I trust you with such private, confidential information in this age of cyberattacks and hacks?

In contrast, when I bought tickets at the counter - running the gamut of standard visitor, standard student, local adult and local senior citizen - all you were interested in was my credit card. At no point were we asked for IDs, not even for local and senior citizen tickets which were at a discount.

I brought my 4.5-year old, excited about all the kids-friendly activities I had read about...

However, the place is a little small, and when there are loads of children (as there was when I was there it being the last day of the school holidays), it can get a little overwhelming and I think that to accommodate so many children, some features had to be cut away, such as the self-design feature of the hopscotch, which was one of the original highlights of the exhibition...

I think the staff was also overwhelmed and I find many of them, sadly, to be quite grouchy. Better trained staff who are more children-friendly and understanding might be better? They shushed the kids going down the slide and seemed to just be policing the area rather than helping guests to enjoy the experience. This is my first time there so it's just based on my one experience which might not be accurate...

Other interesting activities include the colouring of vehicles/sea creatures which when scanned, go up onto the screen. While some activities are intuitive, not all are - like the dragon that comes out to be attacked by the aircraft - and I feel more instructions/engagement with staff could help. Another activity was the Table of Little Men, which was very interactive too. The colourful balls which my daughter pushed across with great excitement was also a highlight for her...

This place is fun for children with changing interactive exhibitions that put kids in mind (looking at the height of the displays and the art & craft stations available at the time).

Get the all-access, so you can browse everything without worry. Personally would spend the whole day here, or at least until early afternoon, if you visit all three exhibitions. Don't rush yourself here because this is interesting for the whole family (although it may depends on theme as well). There is elevator and the whole building is cool with AC, which can be too cold for some (me), so bring extra layers.

To reach this place, you can either take MRT to Bayfront or alight at Promenade and walk along the Helix Bridge.",09-2015,Family,2020-01-30 14:03:17.897199

Or imagine you coloured a rocket and you see it launching on a big LCD screen! Interesting right. We actually did that!

Architect marvel, beautiful white coloured, Lotus shaped building stands near MBS hotel increasing its beauty. We book the tickets online from sistic website and collected tickets from their collection center (nearly every major mall has it, collection center list is there while you book) Or you can buy at the entrance also but it can have huge queue. You can choose time slots while booking tickets and should go at that time, good way to manage the crowd.

Bayfront mrt is the closest to this place, from where you can walk to the exhibition hall.

The Future exhibition is divided in multiple section as you enter. Space, Nature, etc. Every section tries to portray possibilities of future.
There are huge circular table where sun is shining, cloud is floating and it is raining. It is interactive and you can catch the rain. Or you can block the way of miniature people running and they will change the way. Very interesting! One section highlights the rise in sea level due to growing urbanisation and pollution.

For me, the best section was colouring car and fishes and then scanning it with 2D and 3D printer and watching it in big interactive LCD screens. Sat with kid did lot of colouring and it was spend some good quality time. My son enjoyed interactive floor too.

This new permanent exhibition at the ArtScience Museum located at the Marina Bay Sands area is great for all -- young and old alike. Set in a 1,500 sq m blacked-out area, it offers art installations brought to life in displays of light and participation.

You walk in and there is a interactive garden orchard to greet you -- filled with gorgeous flowers and fluttering butterflies.Don't swot the digital butterflies or they'll drop dead right at your feet!

Next up the a Sea Animation Diorama to educate the masses. Comfortable pillows lull you to sit down, but eventually the sea-sick feeling gets you going to the next installation.

The kids will have a blast of a time in the Town.The urban landscape is challenged as you try to keep the traffic going using wooden blocks set against projected car and trains.

Walk further into the room and you'll find huge and colorful stacking blocks waiting for you to move them around. Light enough for a child of five to push and heave, these Block Chairs change colors as you add and subtract them from each other.

Passing by a seven-meter virtual waterfall, you'll be greeted by a sea of bright beach-balls that changes color and sound. The children will have a ball of a time in an arena filled with mayhem and so-much-smiles (just try taking them out of the pit and you'll find out just how much they love the area!).

Turn yet another corner in the darkened room and you'll find yourself in a ""Star Wars"" universe going at hyper-speed. The Space universe is filled with thousands of LED's that give you an illusion of stars in motion.As the lighting changes, you feel you have moved towards the ""Matrix"" background, then, right before your eyes, the vastness of the cosmos.

Thanks teamLab, the Tokyo-based art collective of ""ultra-technologists"", for bringing this digital playground here!

The people here recommend that tickets be purchased using the museum's online system, also, to check on the admission times. As it's located next to MBS, it's best to take the MRT to the Marina Bay station then walk over.Have fun!",04-2016,Family,2020-01-30 14:03:20.510731

Alice in Wonderland, the experience was very well explained on entry and we had different maps to look around and explore. There was a lot about the background on Lewis Carroll and how Alice had came to life over the years in different countries. There were good opportunities for photos and lots on for young and old alike.

Future meets Science - the exhibition gets the public involved with digital integration. However it is fairly crazy in parts with people standing and not moving or moving slowly on walls. Everyone eventually gets a turn at the main areas. The lights are very pretty and can leave you in awe.

Floatopia - this has been put on the top floor and it's a blimp full of joy with giant inflations taking up space and you'd want to run up and cuddle it but you will be asked to step back from the artwork to a marked point for photos.",08-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 14:04:04.383511

Clearly she saw we were a couple of adults with no children around us, so I wish she helped me pick a better option for the two of us.
“Crystal universe” installation at the end is beautiful (that’s the picture they have on a poster) but is not even enjoyable to walk through as you have to wait in a queue for a very long time as people in front take their sweet time to snap a million photos.

We were finished in 10 minutes: the interactive light installations used in all the publicity are simplistic and very small in reality.

The FutureWorld exhibit was absolutely amazing. It was an interactive exhibit! So cool. The first room was a bunch of flowers and butterflies on all of the walls of the room (and the ceiling and floor), then the rain started and so did the amazement. The water would move around your feet, then when you moved, flowers would sprout up. It was so cool!

The next room was the FUN room. There were so many things to do in this room and it was great for kids of all ages. The first thing was a slide with projected objects on it, when you touched them stuff would happen (the cherries would explode and ricochet off other objects). The next part was a table with wooden objects (mountains, water, trains, homes) that when placed on the table would create that object on the table. If you placed 2 of the water objects, it would create a river and if you put the train markers across from each other over the water, it would create a bridge and the train would travel between the two markers.

Next up were drawing stations that you could color a pre-drawn picture then scan into the system so it would be projected onto the wall. There was a Hop Scotch course that was generated by 3 different computers and you actually jump down it. There was so much to do in this room, I couldn’t take it all in.

The Minimalism exhibit was very interesting, but we really should have done that first. It was so much more subdued and thought-provoking that it was a big change after the Future World exhibit.

The Future World exhibition is a series of rooms whereby you can interact with light displays both on walls and on tables. Quite fascinating and intriguing. The children in the museum were having loads of fun.

The 'Sanctuary' room was particularly fascinating as was the 'Space' room. However in this room the staff were hurrying you through the walkway so this spoilt the experience slightly.

The third floor was being prepared for another exhibition so nothing to see there. The top floor there was a short animation with animals and I guess the message was protect our planet.

This is definitely more of a kids place, but we actually ended up having a lot of fun (kids at heart!). We also enjoyed the room where you can do crayon drawings that come to life on the big screens.

Only thing I would suggest is that for the room with all the LED lights, most people going in just seem to want a good photo, but there was a staff member just standing in the middle the WHOLE time at the end, which was pretty annoying. I feel like that prolongs the people in there trying to get a good photo because then they are trying to find an angle where someone (aka the staff member) isn't just loitering in the background of all the photos. It's actually much more efficient just to have a staff member standing at the entrance and the exit of the room to tell people to hurry, than having someone stand in the centre and ruining people's shots.",10-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:04:33.247190

The Insights Tour led by Theo Jansen in the opening weekend was exciting and insightful. He shared about how his “beach animals” were made of PVC tubes, cable ties, recycled plastic bottles, and sails; they could walk when pulled or blown by the wind. Among the 13 Strandbeests on display, we could have a go at pulling 2 of them. Visitors could also view other Strandbeests in action during the reanimation tours held several times a day. By the afternoon, several Strandbeests needed repairing, but this was understandable since the Strandbeests on display were fragile “fossils” that no longer functioned as well. There was also a little crafting corner, though I wished the crafts could have been more closely related to the exhibition (e.g. making a mini leg). I think this exhibition is well worth a visit if you have seen and been curious about the Strandbeests, or have a deep interest in subjects like physics, mathematics, and the arts. Do visit the ArtScience Museum official website when planning your visit to include a guided tour and/or reanimation tour. From now till 30 June 2018, 1-for-1 single exhibition tickets are available for the Wind Walkers exhibition.

I wish I would have taken my son. You could literally spend hours in this place and still not experience it all. It is on the Marina Bay Sands campus so its really close.
Favorite parts:
Wave and waterfall rooms
Crystal light tunnel
Aquarium room
The aquarium was probably the most interesting room to me. You make a drawing of a sea creature and insert it into a machine which scans the image and animates it onto a screen that looks like an aquarium. As you get close to the animated drawing it swims away from you. It blew my mind and I'm sure this description does not do it justice. There was also a graffiti art show here with the original Sheppard Fairy Obama screen print as well as his Obey posters and a plethora of other artists. there was even a wall you could tag on or put stickers on. I was not expecting this type of experience walking in the door. I'd definitely recommend this.

2.. Science part of the museum is not really about science.

3. Treasures of the Natural World has 5 rooms with 30-40 exhibits borrowed from Natural History Museum in London.

The museum itself is a quirky lotus shape, which you can’t miss as part of the iconic Marina Bay Sands skyline.

When we visited, there were three exhibitions:

- Future World
- Natural History
- Evolution of Street Art

You can choose to see one or two or all three when you buy your ticket; we opted for all three ($38pp).

The Future World was interesting but annoying; incredible installations where images / sounds / lights have been digitally manipulated, but are dominated by people using selfie sticks / amateur modelling shoots, so you are constantly waiting to look at the various exhibits.

Additionally, this is where there is the kids interaction, and they run round like cats on fire, screaming. Again, not my idea of fun.

The Natural History exhibit takes a number of pieces from the London Natural History Museum, and is superb. So many interesting artefacts and kudos for London to be showing its wares to the world.

The Street Art exhibition is their current exhibition; I think it is on for approx 6 weeks before something else replaces it.

I enjoyed it tremendously; showing the evolution of graffiti from simple tagging in the 80s, to the use of stencilling by the likes of Banksy in modern day graffiti - really really interesting.

We spent approx 2 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Whilst the Future World was ruined by kids, it would be remiss to lower the score for the museum because of this, as the exhibits are superb.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:05:10.521293

First thing we tried to sit and watch a serious art v science display in a semi-circular room, but feral kids were running around uncontrolled which made it impossible to watch. We then headed for another room and came across an unexpected slide down into the next exhibition, but had to wait until unaccompanied kids pushed their way through and threw themselves down it. The attendant tried to stop them but the parents were in the other room furiously videoing their little darlings.
The rest of that room was based on drawing and colouring and clearly designed for children.
The last room is an impressive hanging light room which would have been great except that people were just not moving through until they had taken a hundred selfies showing their best trout-pouts. Again the attendant tried his best to move people through but most seemed more intent on photographing it than actually enjoying the experience.
I applaud the efforts of the artists to present interesting and entertaining displays, but this is the age of entitlement and selfish self-indulgence, so their creations need to reflect the problems that this brings.",01-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:05:10.930352

So many more things to do and see in Singapore. We walked around the exhibit taking maybe 15-20 minutes at the most and when we left we were basically thinking “that’s it?! Where’s the rest of it?!”

We even went upstairs thinking there would be more, there HAS to be something else. We found emptiness and one room with a cartoon of animals projected onto the wall. So ya, that was it.

I knew from researching it before that we would have to pay a lot to see all exhibits so we had provisionally decided to see just one or two. We opted in the end for HUMAN+ and Future World. As we are non-locals we paid a high price but decided we had no choice so went ahead. We did the HUMAN+ first and both agreed we really enjoyed it. It's a good size for the ticket price and has some very interesting concepts and features and a good mix of medium - audio clips, feature films, interactive displays etc. I particularly enjoyed the part with the so-called 'designer human' babies. I didn't like at all the second exhibition which I really think should be sold only to families. Large parts of it - all in fact - rely on image projection, mostly highly coloured and backed by dramatic music. The music isn't loud enough to drown out the crowds of screaming children, sadly, who run uncontrollably between the spaces. It's nice that they have something so interactive for children and families but I would really suggest the museum sell it as this and only as this. The another annoying thing about this is a wider complaint of Singapore as a whole. Whilst I understand that the artists work is meant to be appreciated and not photographed, the culture of the country seems to be geared to the mindset of a never-ending selfie or social media update: a shameless vanity project which ruins all attempts at culture or artistic endeavour. Not only are you unavoidably forever featuring in these selfies yourself, which isn't something I particularly like the idea of, but you're constantly having to ask people to move whilst they take endless photos and video footage - most of which looks terrible anyway given the low lighting - which distracts from the personal experience. Obviously museums can't stop this and to have 'no cell phone' or 'no photography' signs wouldn't work as they ignore them anyway - several girls asked (as everyone is on entering the final LED light feature) not to touch the lights, were holding on to them whilst their friends looked on laughing and taking their never-ceasing inane photos. I'm ranting like an old man now so I'll stop. But maybe it's worth anyone reading this planning an early visit before the crowds build if you want to avoid this. All in all, I really enjoyed my visit but did feel it was overpriced. However, I would come again. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece in and of itself - and I laud anyone still producing work like this well into their eighth decade. So kudos to Moshe Safdie. It's just a shame that people can't be more respectable.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 14:05:49.215784

There was an additional ‘free’ exhibit Into the Wild on the top floor which we wandered into but did not have the recommended 'device' to really enjoy - probably just as well as we left when a group of unsupervised and unruly school children arrived and took the venue over - disappointing",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 14:05:49.790749

The first one - ""Future World"" - was simply incredible.
It featured numerous interactive visuals exhibits and movies that left us speechless.
Upon entering the exhibition, make sure not to miss the ""Crows"" movie, which is projected all over the wall and ceiling of the theater. It's mind-blowing!
The other exhibits lets you interact with color - paint some pictures, scan them, and watch them come alive on the big screen and on the floor.
One of the most impressive exhibits, however, is the led display, which includes countless led bulbs, which create STUNNING and interactive scenes of space. The exhibit can be controlled by a controller at the far end of the room.
Entry is 12US$ for adult and it totally worth it.
Don't miss it.
All in all, this is an exhibition for all ages (children absolutely love the interaction).
The second exhibition we've seen was ""The universe and art"" and it was literally a waste of time and space. It's a boring exhibition of unrelated exhibits, and you might as well skip it.

I never had interactive exhibits like the drawing and scanning when I was a kid, so I thought it was very fun to see your creation up on the wall in the ""aquarium"" and to see my truck drive in the little Singapore city. The light balls and walls were pretty and colorful and the light tables where you play with the little gnome people and cows was funny and silly.

I thought the NASA exhibit was incredibly well done and I've been to the one at Cape Canaveral in Florida and in some ways thought this was better. I've been to more than 3 space museums and at this one, I still learned new things and was engaged. I particularly liked the front section with the side by side of Glenn and Gagarin and seeing the differences between the Russian space race and the American one. I also loved seeing the film brought back from the moon.

We unfortunately did not get to do the free Into the Wild exhibit as they were on an hour wait but it was a hot Saturday afternoon so that wasn't surprising. I saw many people using the tablets and they looked like they were having fun.

Apart from the delightful object detection on table works the level of interactivity and complexity of response was quite low. The building itself is wonderful. The NASA exhibition had some appealing displays; one of our favourites was the interactive globe, which however was lacking in clarity about the significance of what was being displayed when in the less obvious modes. And much of the tour was just a typical picture/model display which might have originated in a funding pitch or progress report from NASA.

When we visited in Jan 17 we saw these exhibits:
• A Human Adventure (an exhibit about space travel, the USA & Russia space race, and spacecraft, tools and suits through time. There was also a ""ride"" that simulates g-force, I believe it was about 2g, and cost 6$S on the spot)
• Future World (this was a night, colourful and interactive exhibit - it is had to explain but my favourite of the tree. It was a beautiful mixture of art, technology and human movement)
• Journey to Infinity (a display of Esther's work and his influence on modern graphic art - this was also a great walk though, particularly the ""metamorphosis"" displays).

I loved the whole lot, but Future World was my favourite. We purchased a ticket to all three exhibits at the door and it cost 30$S I believe, which is less than if you were to visit each separately.

We did this on our last day, before our flight and it was just perfect.

We accessed the ArtScience Museum through the train station at Marina Bay Sands and it was just a short walk through the shops.

There were also activities targeted at children, such as a digital hopscotch. My favourite activities were the Sketch Christmas / Sketch Town / Sketch Aquarium. There was a range of colouring pages to choose from. Crayons and wet tissue were supplied. Both children and adults were delighted when they scanned in their colouring pages and saw their 2D creations become 3D ones in large interactive screens. Note that the crayons were not in great condition, so you might want to bring along your own set of crayons.

Future World has specific admission times at 10am, 11.30am, 1pm, 2.30pm, 4pm and 5.30pm. There are long queues for purchasing tickets at Art Science Museum, so you might want to start queuing for tickets 15-30 minutes before the admission time you want. Alternatively, purchase your tickets online or at other locations.

The ticketing area had a TV screen publicising this good deal which I was unfortunately not eligible for, but I think many people will find it helpful.

The staff nice to warn us that a school group just went into Future World, so we would be better off starting with Escher... we saw the massive school group leaving later and I was so happy they encouraged us to go elsewhere first.

The Escher exhibit is fantastic! There's a great array of work plus plenty of interactive exhibits too. We really enjoyed it.

Big Bang data was okay. Nothing special.
Van Cleef & Arpels was really empty (we did not see anyone else when we visited) and pretty boring. Also, the security guards kept following us like we were going to steal something which was annoying yet amusing at the same time.

So it was with a deep sense of satisfaction that we chanced upon these excellent displays of art and technology at the ArtScience museum. Talk about hands fitting gloves: all of that technomania suddenly came together in some really magnificent arts-meets-science installations that used minimalistic music, computer controlled lighting, and some really clever ideas to produce art that can only be called fun. The museum has three excellent shows going on. One is a ""sound and light"" display that is fun for all ages, epsecially the room where animal menageries respond to touch by turning tail and fleeing, or else transforming themsleves into another species. The second is a Big Data exhibition that, even if it doesn't quite answer the question of ""so what are all of these beautiful dsplays actually good for,"" at least makes for very impressiv maps and visualizations (and ots of envy). The third is a movie up on the 4th floor that should not be skipped. It's Werner Herzog intervieing data scientists on how data is changing the world, and it's really not to be missed. It takes about half a day to see all three museums, so if you go early you'll be out in time for lunch in the futuristic mall that the museum is part of, and then you can still walk down to the cloud forest and flowering gardens just a bit further down the bay to make a very satisfying day of it.",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 14:06:40.855177

Sadly, we did not have time for the Gem Exhibition or the Digital world, but would have enjoyed them if we had more time. One annoyance, common to many Singapore attractions, is that visitors are charged more, often significantly more in the case of seniors, than locals.

I was worried. She may find something there that will make me steal the Crown Jewels if I am to make her happy. Or it could be an agonizing wait for me. But as it turns out there were two other exhibits, Future World, and Big Bang Data. Splendid! We can split the chores of liking and looking at them. I ended up follow in her.

The last time we were there, it was the respective exhibitions of Vincent Van Gogh and Andy Warhol that were mounted.

I found the Future World engaging but more so for the children who are allowed explore and question, wonder and weave tales that will define their worlds years from now.

Big Bang Data gave the jolting reality that the world is actually running of meta data in 1's and 0's translated into algorithms that build and recreate, that I wonder is in the end humans are the outsiders to artificial intelligence?

What blew our minds was the exhibit of the artistic and unique jewels created by the Maison of Van Cleef and Arpels. The actual or replica copies were breathtaking in their intrinsic ornateness and systematic order that all the sparkles and glitters are as much about the marrying of materials from precious (diamonds, emerald, rubies, etc.) to semi-precious stones (quartz, agate, malachite, corals) or even wood, as the engineering that went with each piece of bespoke jewelry. The detail and the craftsmanship, artistry and innovation have remained the trademark of a piece of art with many functions, as tiara, or an a necklace.

The Arts Science Museum lived up to its word as an outstanding venue that educates as much as it entertains. It brings science to its impactful simplicity with wider consequence, and curates art or artistic expression that opens new perspective. We learn more of ourselves and our surroundings, in the end.

My wife and myself took with us not any of the baubles exhibited but the book catalogue of the Van Cleef and Arpels exhibition and plenty of sobering thoughts about what finery and ornaments say about their wearers.",07-2016,Couples,2020-01-30 14:06:52.962804

I did the regular museum + Alice in Wonderland. The entire time at the museum was around 1 hour. The Alice in Wonderland exhibit was done very well and I am glad that I added that onto my regular ticket. You get to see from start to finish how Alice in Wonderland has progressed, and go through some obstacles as well. It is a very fun exhibit and I would certainly do this one again.

The main exhibit however was a bit dull. It is great for kids so if you have kids this is at least half a day. I saw plenty of families playing around with a lot of the different objects they have throughout. For adults though I would say this isn't a must-do while in Singapore. I went here while it was raining and it was perfect for that. Besides the light display that I am sure you have seen all over Instagram there isn't too much more to it.

‘Future World’ I believe is a permanent fixture there. This is the one where they have more than 170,000 LED lights which create a crystal universe giving you an illusion of being in space. A big photo opportunity!

‘Human+ The Future of our Species’ is another one I paid to see and was worth the money. This goes through what it would mean to be a human in a world of robots, cyborgs and clones; as well as much more. They even have an AI robot, Nadine, who you can sit and have a conversation with. This exhibition is on until 15 October

‘Serpenti form art jewellery design’ – Something to do with snakes and jewellery! I didn’t do this one.

‘Into the Wild’ – This is a free one and good for both adults and children. You can get a VR headset which will guide you through the museum and get you to do a few fun things. There’s also a short film to watch at the final place it takes you to.

My ticket for 2 exhibitions (Future World and Human+) cost $28 (around £15).

Aside from the museum you also have Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands and the Mall, to name a few, all within a couple of minutes’ walk away.",09-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 14:08:08.223381

i. Although I have been there couple of times myself, I'm writing a review for all when I was invited to witness the pre-launching of Panasonic's Future of Technology presentation. I also visited it prior to that for the Large Hadron-Accelerator. Let's get to it.
o Being around MBS, this art science museum takes on the high-class and elegant stance while educating the public in different disciplines.
o The water lily ""pond"" was modern and pretty. It does not look out of place and the word of Art Science Musuem is very evidently presented there, with confidence. You've got to take a picture there!
o The vicinity of the art science Musuem is the heart beat of the Bayview of Singapore. First timer will go ""wow!"" in every way they turn.
- Ground floor and second floor are usually paid exhibition. The first is your lobby and the third floor is free for all most of the time because it briefly promotes the history of the building design and it also plays documentary-liked film at a scheduled time daily.
o The paid exhibition is always very captivating. From the collider to the Panasonic ones, they have done a marvelous job in setting a high standard of a professional art and science Musuem should be like. The design of the exhibition, the color and contrast, the description and history are all excellently done.
o Amazing cool looking see-through glass lobby!
x The pond is quite dirty and filled with moss because the water does not flow.
x The water lily gets blown to the edge a lot of times, leaving big part of the pond exposed. The green does not look very balanced.

We had two people with us who were initially very vocal about the fact they didn’t like “museums” and were sceptical of what this would be about. They loved it!

The ‘Future World’ exhibits were all about people interacting with art and science. For example, you could colour in or draw a house, plane, car on a regular piece of paper and then quickly scan it and watch it be added to a giant, animated virtual city, alongside everyone else’s creations.

There was a dark room with a virtual waterfall where the presence of people in the room disrupted the flow of water just like it would in nature.

Basically, I highly recommend it and you should check it out for yourself! Allow about 90-120mins depending on whether you have small children, as there’s plenty for them and they could want to stay a while!

,1,51,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/tangylime,595146717,11-07-2018,5,An afternoon well spent.,"Spent an afternoon with friends here. Got all access tickets and took our time starting with Marvel, to Future World, to Wind Walkers, and last but not least, we managed to catch The Hedy Lemarr Story.

Marvel Studios exhibit was mostly informative with little interactive pieces. It gave you a walkthrough experience, meeting Iron Man, Captain America, The Guardians, Dr. Strange and ""in real life"" explanation of the science behind the weaponry and their worlds.

In Future World, you start off with a crow's eye view, flying and bursting into colors and patterns. Note that it may cause motion sickness. Trick is focus on one object through the journey. Don't worry too much as you come out to lulling waves and you can relax for a few minutes to recuperate. This was my favourite part of this exhibit. After that, you'll find a series of interactive art and displays. Overall, very interactive.

Wind Walkers felt like being in Da Vinci's workshop. It was awareness raising and a solution oriented approach. It was interesting because it was an exhibit that veered away from the digital and computer applications in the previous exhibits. This was purely mechanical, environmental friendly, earth saving, and pro active. It was really nice to feel the propulsion of energy when you got to interact with each piece, how each piece felt different from each other.

The best part was wandering into the theatre a minute before Bombshell: The Hedy Lemarr Story began playing. What a wonderful way to end our exploration. You must catch this while it's running. I will not spoil it but all I'll say is that she was beautiful and brilliant till the end. Thank you Hedy for making our day and leaving in our hearts forever the lessons you learnt.

Thank you ArtScience Museum for the amazing selections.",07-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 14:10:23.221683

The building is a modern art work in itself, resembling a lotus flower with separate sections and exhibits in the petals. While short on lengthy descriptions of hard science, many parts of the museum are more interactive as well as child-friendly. My only complaints are that 1) it can be difficult to purchase tickets there - I had to go to the mall across the street to get them and 2) visitors need to buy multiple tickets for different parts of the museum. This might be necessary for the Louvre or the Smithsonian, but the ArtScience Museum is small enough to see entirely in less than a day.
Other than those minor inconveniences, it is a good way to spend a few hours. The Future World section was particularly interesting. While initially seeming to be for children, the interactive state-of-the-art walls and floors and other areas and objects reacting to visitors actions could well interest a few adults as well.",03-2018,Friends,2020-01-30 14:10:24.160732

In Future World, there are beautiful light exhibits and interactive art and light activities where you colour in aquatic animals or houses and cars. Your designs are then projected onto the walls, where you can interact with them by tapping your projected design. My favourite was definitely the one where you could create mountains and animals by absorbing powers. I went on a Sunday so there was a lot of children there as well. Nevertheless, the drawing stations have many tables and crayons, so even the adults have space to join in the fun.

Human+ was thought provoking and somewhat disturbing in that the content is designed to challenge social norms and create dialogue about the role and evolution of humans to better adapt to the future. Highlight of this exhibition was the end where you can interact with a robot. I missed out on the VR activity which is only available from 2:30PM - 4:30PM.

A few more recommendations is to go during or right after lunch because the crowd is much smaller.

It started out with a movie of a performance artist strapped to an internet connected robot for hours while strangers around the world manipulated his limbs. Things went downhill from there.

Another highlight was a robotically controlled needle attached to another ""artist's"" arm, which would puncture his arm and draw blood whenever there was a news report of an American GI casualty in IRAQ.

The grand finale was the Euthanasia Coaster, designed with ever tighter loops so that at the end the rider would experience such high G forces that he/she would be killed.

At the time I visited this is what was on exhibit:

MC Escher collection: very extensive of a lot of his work. I enjoyed this.
NASA Exhibit: all sorts of artifacts and displays from various missions.
Interactive art: this was my favorite. Visitors can decorate coloring pages and watch them come to life on the huge protection on the wall. This is great for all ages!

A Must Visit!,"I had been underestimating about the place, ArtScience? as I only imagined it would not be a worthy place to go. But, a very good friend of mine convinced me that this place is a must-visit. Thank God I got invited to visit it this time.

To my amazement I was so happy when we got in. My favorite artist Escher - his tons of work were exhibited. So I need not go to his museum in Vienna, had a plan to go there. So so thrilled to look at many of Escher's work. Best part of my visit here

Then I was again stunned with more interactive exhibitions in this museum, how science can be combined with arts. I was brought into a different dimension.

So much to learn, to be aware of on what kind of achievements mandkind have so far. Then the interaction with nature or the galaxy?

Unable to express into words how the museum affected me as it was all the experience and feeling like in a journey of imagination, to another dimension, or making you look differently towards life.

It has the sensory stuff to make an effect on you. How much fun I had! Will definitely go back there!",01-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 14:11:09.690997

The interior of the museum was nicely air conditioned (it was a hot day!), clean toilets. I like the cafe on the ground floor right in front of the entrance. Offers a great view of Marina Bay while you sip a cup of coffee ;)

The exhibitions would generally appeal to people aged 10 and above depending on the subject. The NASA exhibition was generally interesting and quite kid friendly with the various displays of astronaut equipment, space food etc. Reminds me of a ultra compressed Smithsonian Air and Space Museum exhibition (although nowhere as good). The particle accelerator exhibition however was extremely content (Physics) heavy with many long technical explanations. Definitely boring and too difficult for children aged 12 and below to understand and appreciate.

Discounted tickets available for Singaporeans, students, the elderly and children. I recommend taking a look a the website before making a trip down. There are occasionally some free exhibitions worth taking a look at.",01-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 14:11:10.868789

Go on and have fun with the different designs!

We were quite confused at the ticketing online and bought the ticket on the day itself and everything turned out fine. Love that everything was interactive and were easily great set-ups for photo shoots. I would have given myself more time since some installations might crowd up with people (especially if you wanna take a photo that doesn't have others in it).

My favourite one is the colouring part. Where you can colour the drawing they gave you and scan them. After that, your drawing will shows in the big screen in 3D! It was super cool! Big data may not very suitable for children. But the exhibition is interesting and unique. They have a huge pile of photos shown the number of photos uploaded in internet in 24 hours.

As is the case, foreigners and Singaporeans pay different rates to visit the museum, but you can also get a 2 for 1 deal with a Sands Card - just stop by the casino, sign up and the card is in your hand. Just stroll by before you go to the museum to avail of this benefit - no gambling required.

Chose to see two of the attraction / exhibits. The Art of Science and Gems. An amazing display sponsored by Van Cleef and Arpels of Paris, and in conjunction with a museum in Paris. The exhibition shows the geological formation of minerals, and the requirements for the gemstones to form well below the earths crust. It looks firstly at diamonds, then at numerous precious and semi precious stones. There are displays of both the natural form of the stones and also cut stones in jewellery pieces. There is an excellent video showing how jewellery is made and how gem stones are classified. I was truly amazed by the jewellery on display - from pieces made for European and Arab royalty to Van Cleef and Arpels designer pieces. Photography is allowed without flash.

The second gallery we visited was that of Future World: Where Art Meets Science. It was interesting and there were many animated displays - of the sea and tides. Of light and of children's attractions and interactive play stations. They never had anything like this when I was a child. Appreciated a rest on the floor and watching the river go by - changing sky, rocks etc. At the end are numerous light curtains which afford great photographic experimentation. Amazing - as the lights keep varying in brightness the opportunities expand.
