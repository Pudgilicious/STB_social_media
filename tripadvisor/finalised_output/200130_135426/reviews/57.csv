It only costs S$ 6, and you can see many places in Singapore that you cannot see that close from Marina Bay Sands. For example, Chinatown, the Tanjong Pagar Port, Sentosa, among others. The view is better going North, South and West. The views towards the East are blocked by other tall buildings, so it is not possible to see most of Marina Bay Sands (only the tip of the top is visible), as well as other attractions in the city centre. You can spot Indonesia easily and if you are lucky and go during a clear day, you can even spot Malaysia and the silhouette of buildings in Johor Bahru.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-30 14:36:36.748187

There are something like 7 blocks of apartments joint together by a skybridge on the 26th floor and the main attraction on the 50th floor.
The views are amazing and you'll easily spend something like an hour just walking around and taking some really good photos. Weekdays are much better and I would highly recommend coming on a weekday since weekends tend to be somewhat crowded.
I came by on a weekend, some time around 6'ish to catch the sunset and just couldn't catch any peace and quiet. It's simply bustling with kids, other photographers, a handful of other tourists and even spotted a property agent or two bringing their prospective clients for a tour of the place.
On another occasion, I came by around 8pm on a weekday and you'll still catch amazing views of the entire city and it was so much better! The twinkling lights of the city, there was a strong wind blowing so it was cool and there were so much fewer people around so it gives you time to be alone, enjoying the peacefulness and tranquility.",12-2015,Family,2020-01-30 14:36:44.668922

Having been turned off by pricey rooftop bars (esp Marina Sands to name but a few) this site offers spectacular views 50 storeys up at a very modest sum, which serves upkeep of building. Wide open space to enjoy amazing views unhurried.
Although does not reach the ideal Esplanade waterfront you get an breathtaking view of the Container Shipyard, the outer City & Skyline looking East (masking the Marina Bay). All the same if you want a stunning view without burning your pocket then this is an ideal venue.
We weren't disappointed.
The cost is Sing$5pp & the tickets are restricted daily (to about 200 visitors i understand) so dont leave it too late.

You need a NETS card (but almost everyone will have one for travel) and that's loaded for access. $6 cash and you go up to the 50th floor.

In the event we went off and got cool drinks from the minimart in the building and returned 20 minutes later to find the sign still up. I tapped on the window and reluctantly the sign was removed and we were able to buy tickets for the lift. A rather bad show I thought. However the view from the top is well worth the paltry entrance charge. A magnificent vista of the docks, the old railway station, over to the southern ridges and Mount Faber. We had the place almost to ourselves. It is interesting to see a different perspective of the City instead of just the business quarter and Gardens on the Bay and the charge is nominal unlike the highly priced Maria Bay Sands.",12-2017,Couples,2020-01-30 14:37:11.446650

As suggested we were there around sunset and stayed until it got dark. Definitely recommended.

It comprises of seven entirely residential 50 storey towers (making it the tallest residential building in the world), each connected by 500 meter sky-gardens on the 26th and 50th floors.

Please note, although you can enter any tower and take a lift up to the 50th floor, you will be greeted by a locked turnstile! So you must go to the small office at the foot of block G1. It costs $6 for non-residents to go up to see the view but you need to have an EZ travel card. Since we didn't have a travel card, the helpful man allowed us go up if we left a deposit with him in his office.

The views from the top were superb, although it's worth noting you can't see Marina Bay Sands. One side overlooked the colourful docks and the other side looked out across the terracotta roofs of Chinatown to the polished skyscrapers of the business district. My favourite was the Oasia hotel, almost entirely covered in vegetation.

We walked along the walkways that joined the seven towers and there were lots of plants, fixed furniture and even a park where I saw the biggest grasshopper I've ever seen.",03-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 14:37:19.123152

We then paid $6 each (had to be cash) to have our MRT cards registered so that we could use them to swipe us through the turnstile. The view was amazing and it's incredible to be able to walk all the way around the 7 towers. But just be careful when you are going in or out of the turnstile to be ready to push it as soon as you swipe your card otherwise you might lose your chance to go through and then you'll have to share the turnstile with your partner like I did.

How to go - get down at Outram park MRT station and proceed to cantonment exit and go to the block G of the building. speak to the security there and tell tehme that you want to got to sky park.
Genenrally your EZ link card should work. if not, they will take 5 dollard and give you a recepit. They also ask you to call once you reach 55 floor to open the security gate for you.

Then it is up to you. how many views you wish to see, it has resting shelters shady places and open bences to enjoy.and offers numerous views of singapore in all directions,.

This is a Best alternative to Marina bay Sands which charges you around 30 - 40$ but limited space allowed.

The view was nice enough. For me it was too close to the city, so the lights were not as wonderful as it should. One could still see all the chaos of the busy city. And it was so dark up there. Not dangerous though, almost all level ground (some kids even roller-skating around) but perhaps some lights in the some areas would be nice. Small lightings on the far fences, that's all there was.

You can see Sentosa, the freight boats, and the buildings around you. This is a collection of 5 buildings that are about 1 million a flat I think to live here. Different buildings will have small little gardens and cute architectural seats to promote communal interaction and little lawns of grass. My only problem is that to prevent jumping off, they put a fence that is 3 foot from the railing you're already held behind by, so it's hard to get some shots b/c you are 4-5 feet from the edge and behind 2 railings. Bring a selfie stick to help you out with this part.

The ticket machine was out of action but there was a gentleman in the office who took the cash S$6 each and gave door access on our Singapore Tourist Pass cards. We were directors to the life and told to exit the same way.

Once in the roof here are great views in all directions. We walked all around on the roofs of the 5 buildings connected by walkways. We hardly saw anyone else whilst we were there. There are quirky seating areas where you can relax and take in the views.

Well worth a visit.",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 14:39:23.291854

I visited it in daytime and even though the sun was harsh, I managed to have a complete stroll around the walk to see the city. In the evening, I went there again for a visit. After sunset, the whole city lights were gleaming beautifully and you can get the whole view of the city below, and the business district from afar.

Little does any know that this place also serve for diplomatic purpose. Officials from other countries are often invited to this place to have a view, and these VIP will sit in the higher room which is in the center of the walkway. Note this for your next Singapore trip.",03-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 14:39:25.379523
