The orchid garden is the only part of the garden that you'll need to pay to get into and is well worth S$5- entry.
The range of orchids on display is the widest available in Asia and was memorable.
You'll need half a day to enjoy all the gardens have to offer.
Like all of Singapore's attractions that we visited, the gardens were superbly well maintained with all amenities that a visitor would want.

They advertise it as free and whilst a lot of it is, just be aware the main attractions do cost a few dollars, the orchid garden from example is $5 for adults $1 students and seniors and free for 12 and under.

The orchid garden is stunning though and should not be missed. A well constructed colorful garden will overhanging archways and interesting nooks and crannys.

Keep your eye out for the many lizards walking across the paths, they are harmless but they freak you out if you unexpectedly come across them at close range and/or nearly step on one :)

The short walk from the MRT station was fun in itself as we came upon two black swans plodding along looking for food from the visitors.
Plus there were hundreds of turtles in the same pond which were entertaining.

Once inside the Jacob Ballas Garden we were able to drop off my grandsons scooter just within the entrance and grab a map.
This garden was designed purely with children in mind so is delightful, there’s so much for them to do.

We started by visiting the farm which had good charts indicating from which Countries the food in Singapore is sourced. My grandson loves Maps of the World currently so we spent a lot of time at this point.
We then headed to the Treehouse and spent an hour there climbing, sliding, making friends, sharing snacks and playing in the sand.
Then walked on through the garden over a bridge to ‘chat’ with the terrapins, see the waterfall, trample along the suspensed bridge and onto another play area.
He loved jumping on the small trampoline set into the ground and then followed the trail which led to a climbing frame and a zip wire.
After a couple of turns it was time for lunch so we continued our walk along the trail chasing butterflies along the way until we reached the Cafe.
The menu was great for children and adults too, and was enjoyed by all.
We probably spent around 2.5hrs there this visit and revisited two days later joined by an additional family member.
My grandson loved it just as much the second time!!

I think it’s worth mentioning that this is totally free, you can take your own snacks and drinks, the Cafe was optional, we didn’t go the first visit but took money the second visit and ate lunch there.

Highly recommend for families with children up to 10yrs I’d say.",08-2019,Family,2020-01-26 09:45:21.525775

When we were there a large section was under reconstruction so better is coming. Of course there were many orchids in flower and many fully labelled though not all. The golden arches are just delightful. The main body of the gardens offer many walking tracks. The day we were there was quite hot (it is Singapore). Ther are cooler ares and the main food court was much cooler. We found the rain forest walk very pleasant and it had some educational material which pointed out some very different features which were fascinating.

It is a very versatile park that is only 8mins from Orchard Road. Less if the traffic flows faster during non-peak hours.
NParks team of gardeners are constantly coming up with new themes for tourists, so even for those who have visited will find other reasons to visit aside from the regular attraction of Orchid Gardens or Bonsai collection etc.
The park is huge and not possible for a family to cover all areas in one day, unless actively jogging around. Also, the humidity would force a family to stop for drinks and rests.
Would recommend each petson carries an umbrella to shield from the sun, or rains.
To truly experience the two main quadrants of the park, and admire the squirrels, lizards and birds of the park on close encounter, I would recommend at least 4-5hrs for each quadrant especially if prefer to do it at a leisurely pace with stops for drinks at cafe and toilet stops to freshen up because if you are not sweating from the humidity, then either it is a cool/rainy day or you have faulty sweat glands!! :p

There is a restaurant in the middle of the gardens, Casa Verde. It is quite expensive but has a good range of western and Asian food. Ate here because a large storm came across so was an excellent place to stop!

We visited the Herb Garden (small but lovely), the Ethnobotany Garden (slightly over her head but interesting for grown ups), the Foliage Garden (unexpectedly captivating, walking along a raised walkway and being surrounded by literally every type of leaf you could imagine), and the Evolution Garden (the highlight of the visit, even though we accidentally did it backwards i.e. Rainforest back to Jurassic).

We saw free range cockerels, tiny hummingbird-type birds and mighty black swans.

The fact that it has been around since the 1800’s makes it more amazing. I personally prefer it so much more than Gardens by the Bay.

The British , who used to run Singapore, contributed much with the beginning of the SBG with their steep knowledge on the establishment and the design .

It is a very walkable garden suited for young strollers and kids in “strollers”, and a great place for negative ions.

Culinary delights are made available to refresh the body too.

The foliage and the serenity are prized . Choose mornings or evenings to visit.

The upto 6 year olds should be brought to the relative of the SBG, the Jacob Ballas Garden, for additional outdoor enjoyment .",04-2018,Family,2020-01-26 09:51:50.648348

It later blossomed into the centre for rubber and orchid experimentation leading to the development of the region’s rubber industry and Singapore as a leading orchid exporter. Today its Herbarium, housing over 750,000 specimens, and lab facilities are at the forefront of orchid hybridisation, and research in the region’s vast horticultural and agricultural resources.

In 2015 the Botanic Gardens was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage site.

Occupying a sprawling 82 hectare patch on the edge of the city, it has three entry/exit points with convenient links by bus and MRT.

The main attractions are:

1. The extensive collection of tropical trees, palms, ferns and shrubs dotting its undulating site with meandering walks and footpaths.

2. The National Orchid Garden with many spectacular specimens named after distinguished heads of state and celebrities who visited.

3. The Rain Forest, the last remaining area of virgin jungle with many endangered flora and fauna, to be explored on its boardwalk trail.

4. The Tembusu Tree, once a selfie must have, now a sad memory after the 270 year old tree fell, taking one life.

5. The Swan Lake, home to a bevy of white swans

6. Symphony Lake, an open-air concert venue with band and orchestral performances from its waterside bandstand.

7. Several English style pavilions where weary walkers can seek respite.

8. Restaurants and cafes to pitstop for refreshments, including one with menu for tailored for kids.

9. Souvenir shop to pick your mementos.

Admission is free. Ample restroom and drinking fountains are conveniently located.

Even if you don't like plants, I recommend you giving this place a try. It is beautiful and serene and is a great place for brisk jogs or walks with the family. The area of the garden is quite large and there are multiple routes to different parts of the garden (so bring a map as it is easy to get lost).

They have an impressive diversity of plants and house one of the biggest collections of orchids (for an additional fee entrance fee) for those who may be interested. I thought their orchid section was definitely worth a visit.

Conclusion: if you have time to spare, need to resettle your mind, or love plants—come visit this garden! Plus, admission is free.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-26 09:53:03.830443

We decided to go to the Botanic Gardens as it was a short taxi ride away from our hotel in Robertson Quay.The Gardens are not designed to be a tourist attraction, it is where locals go for their picnic, jog/walk/stroll or just a day out with nature.But there are parts of the gardens where you find more tourists than locals (the National Orchid Gardens for one). Be prepared to walk (a good walking shoe would help) and also carry water and food. There are many lovely areas where you could do a quick picnic. The trees look spectacular and many of them very old (60+ years). The swan lake is pretty with an interesting stone sculpture in the middle. The National Orchid Gardens charges a fee for foreigners and seemed to be the photographers' favourite. It is undoubtedly very beautiful, though i expected a little more flowers. We did not plan our trip very well, so we just walked as we pleased for a little more than 2 hours with some breaks in between. But there are attractions within the gardens, which could be more interesting for children (my 6 year old wasn't too pleased with all the walking and looking at trees!). These close early and hence it is better to plan the visit. Nevertheless, i loved the gardens and it is definitely a good stop to admire nature at its best (and also to avoid the crowds at all the other regular tourist attractions).",12-2017,Family,2020-01-26 09:53:11.239246

I have visited the gardens many times and never tire of going back. There are many walks and welcome places to get a drink and a snack. In the Singapore heat it is difficult to see everything on one visit as it is quite large.

Access is quite easy via taxi or MRT and most of the garden is free to wander around. Many locals go there for exercise, which they do in sometimes quite large groups. For the most part these are very considerate to visitors simply there to enjoy the gardens. Among my favourite parts are the lakes, the Heliconia walk, the Foliage walk (all free to view) and the orchid garden (admission charges apply). When there with my grandson we purchase food from a vending machine in one of the lakeside pavilions and he squeals with delight as the terrapins and fish compete for it.

If you are lucky and the gardens are fairly quiet you can see sunbirds, racket-tailed drongo, kingfishers, hornbills, jungle fowl and glossy starling - among others. Of course the ubiquitous mynahs are everywhere and butterflies also add to the delights available.

It changes every time I visit as works are carried out, I never tire of it. In short, I love it!

The newly opened space is the learning forest where you have a chance to experience fresh water swamp. Bring a camera along if you like to take some pictures of wildlife. There's the common monitor lizard foraging for food in the hot afternoon and singing birds (i managed to capture a pic of the common redflame woodpecker) for the late afternoons or early mornings. A great place to spend the whole day just taking pictures and a leisurely walk. Do bring a bottle of water along because it can get very hot from 11 am onwards. Pack some lunch along too. Avoid eating at The Halia (it's overpriced). Unfortunately the restaurant Food for Thought at the Visitor's Centre (near Tanglin Gate) is closed but the other visitor centre (near Raffles Bldg) has an eating place too. I am uncertain of cost there because I have never been there. But I often seen a crowd so the prices must be reasonable. The Garden can be accessed via MRT or public bus.

I am certainly impressed with how well kept and manicured the place is. Being Singapore, you would expect this, but perhaps as a garden/park, some elements of ""rawness"" would certainly not go amiss, less man-made structures more natural ones.

It takes me an hour to brisk walk just the circumference. To go by bus, you can enter via the Tanglin gate at Holland Road or take the MRT and enter via the Bukit Timah gate exiting Botanic Garden Station (downtown line). To drive, you can park at the Botany Centre's basement car park entering Cluny Road, or further in turning at Nassim gate. There are the 2 shaded car parks. More parking lots around the whole garden; but if you want to visit the Orchid Gardens then the nearest car park is at the new Tyersall gate on Tyersall Avenue. That's where all the tourist coaches go to.
Think of the garden as a lying down figure 8. On the left bottom is the Tanglin gate and you'll walk in and pass the Swan Lake on your left and on your right the Heritage Garden. Straight ahead you'll have the new learning forest on your left and the ginger garden on your right. 50 more steps you'll reach the Orchid Plaza, the entrance to the Orchid Gardens. Tickets are required for entry but it is worth the while if you enjoy orchids cos the enclosure is rather huge and you can spend a minimum 30 mins just to cover the area.
The symphony lake where the week end concerts are held at the Symphony stage is just a little further to the right past the Orchid Plaza.
Now you've only covered the left circle on the figure 8.
The Visitor Centre & Nparks HQ is at the centre of the ""8"" where the Nassim gate entry leads to.
Now on the right side of the figure 8; you'll find the Evolution garden,
Fragrant garden, healing garden; all having plants with different scents, colours, shapes and sizes. There are explanatory signs to the plants and you can spend another hour just to explore.
Further to the other end past the Cluny Park gate you'll find the Jacob Ballas children's garden , the Eco lake and spacious greens to do your tachis, yoga or Pilate. You'll find different groups of people doing just that in the weekend mornings.
So on the upper top of this right side is the Bukit Timah gate where the MRT station is.
Come here to walk, jog, picnic, exercise, eat at the few food outlets, take photos or just lie on the green lawns, the Singapore Botanical Garden is a good way to relax and bond with your loved ones.",08-2017,Family,2020-01-26 09:55:28.852102

Rolling lawns, lotus lake, orchid garden, swan lake, amphitheater (check site for performances) - that covers it, I think.
It is not a touristy place and does not figure much on rushed itineraries of tour operators or those who blitz thru Singapore in 3-4 days.
You can have a small picnic with snacks on the lawn or eat at some of the restaurants that are on the grounds.

Learnt about Johore Figs which start in the canopy of another tree then grow down, and were wowed by the huge lily pads on the pond.
We also saw some large lizards .

Its first scientific director Henry Nicholas Ridley was an English botanist and geologist who lived much of his life in Singapore.

He perfected the technique of rubber extraction (still in use to date) and promoted its economic value to planters in the region. Rubber output expanded rapidly in the Malay Peninsula.

Now, the BOTANIC GARDENS has very huge amount of tropical plant collection of more than 10,000 species in its 74 hectares of land. Unlike FLOWER DOME & CLOUD FOREST which are both temperature-controlled glass-house conservatories, the BOTANIC GARDENS is naturally tropical.

Within the GARDENS is the NATIONAL ORCHID GARDEN with its largest orchid collection of more than 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids.

The BOTANIC GARDENS has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2015.

Whether you're botanist or an ordinary being, you will enjoy being in the BOTANIC GARDENS.

I love being here even though it was quite hot. Me & my family were taking a bus from Bugis. It took 30 minutes bus ride. But if you take MRT, you can get there and alight in MRT Botanic Garden (take the blue line MRT route). After we arrived, we walked for 5-10 minutes to go to garden's entrance gate. There was a guard who is very helpful (he gave us many information regarding the garden).

For your information, there is no entrance fee to enter and visit this garden but there are several places inside this garden which require you to pay entrance fees.

This place is a good place to take a long walk / run with awesome surroundings (trees, lake, wild animals, unique plants, etc). If I'm not mistaken, it takes 2.5 km from one side to the other side of the garden. If you enjoy the garden, you will not noticed that you have walk that long. By the way, when we went to the toilet, it was surprisingly very clean and no bad smells. FYI, mostly the Singapore's toilets weren't clean and sometimes very smelly.

Whilst travelling this garden, I found & saw 2 big lizards climb up the big trees. It was a rare moment for me and my family. Also there is a swan lake but I only saw couple of swan.

If you get thirsty, there is a place (Orchid Plaza) which you can buy drinks and souvenirs. It is nearby the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage.

Overall, I love this place and will visit it again if I travel to Singapore again. A highly recommended place to visit in the heart of the city of Singapore.",03-2017,Family,2020-01-26 09:57:55.837604

It has different sections with their own attractions: a real rainforest, orchids, lakes, swamp, water-falls, healing plants, tropical fruit and nut trees, as well as extended stretches of grass for just laying around or having a pick-nick. You can also observe wildlife including various bird species, big but friendly lizards, fish and turtles, swans, wild chicken, etc.

It's open from 5 until midnight every day, if you go before 8 am or after 8 pm it starts to be much more calm in the Gardens and it's also less hot. It's only a 15 min. walk from Orchard Road but you can also reach it by bus or metro (MRT).

Locals love it for having a walk, for jogging and other sports, and you can also join activity groups for yoga, tai-chi, meditation, gymnastics, music and so on.

Within these meticulously kept gardens lie some of the most beautiful specialist gardens I have had the privilege to see - the Orchid Gardens and the specialist Ginger Gardens.
Singapore is a fairly hot place to visit but the humidity is killer. I suggest that you give yourself at the very minimum a half day to walk around these gardens and take plenty of water with you. There are many places to sit and relax out of the direct sunlight but do yourself a favour and take your time to enjoy the experience. Just quietly, the little restaurant in the grounds near the Orchid Gardens is quite expensive so I suggest you take some snacks and get something to eat after you leave the gardens.

Almost every plant, tree or flowering plant is accompanied with information about them. The visitor will not be left in question about any plant which is not familiar to them. One of the most delightful activity is to be able to just spread a mat and have a family picnic at any part of the garden you like.
It's a refreshing place to be and its just about 10 minutes taxi ride from the busy, glamorous Orchard Road area. If driving, there is ample parking space at the front entrance underground carpark.

And this is not the best one as many review said.

It is surprising why this can be nominated as World Heritage while there is no real true historic nature and beauty on the site but artificial ones.
I hope Singapore people visit other parks around the world to learn how to make such level of gardens.

As many other parks, locals are really not good to maintain the site.
Children's park items are constantly broken and man made pond/lake are smelly.

Most of maintenance workers are not likely Singaporeans and cheap foreign labors which I do not feel good about it. If you proud of your garden, it should be taken full of care by locals...

Still, lot of lawn spaces so it can be good place to gather big groups and do some picnic. However, Singapore park has BITING ANTS which really Bite your skin to the level it really hurts and make you jump. So, you have to be very very careful where you sit or touch.

On day 9, we decided to walk up to the Singapore Botanical Gardens as a time filler, rather than take the trip to the Zoo. We were not disappointed.

Our walk up Nassim Road to the gate was very interesting. Many Embassies and opulent homes to view. A nice change after the hustle of Orchard Road, and its surrounding high rise apartment living. A little like walking around Beverley Hills.

The Gardens themselves are huge, with many lakes and streams. Our kids enjoyed sitting by Symphony Lake watching the turtles swim. We were also surprised to watch a family of (rather large) lace monitors swimming and sitting in the banks. These sightings were appreciated more as they were unexpected.

Best of all, the main gardens are free, and have many themed areas to visit.

That being said, it is well worth paying the nominal entry fee to visit the Orchid Gardens contained within the grounds themselves. Unlike other paid attractions in Singapore, it is a large exhibit and you can easily pass a few hours wondering around.

Visit during the morning or early evening as it is very hot in the afternoon. If you are coming from the Nassim Road gate (visitor centre) just visit the gardens by going left, that is where the orchid gardens are.
If you are coming in by MRT, Botanic Gardens MRT is at Cluny Road, It will be a long walk thru the gardens. Not much to see around there, mostly for families doing picnics.

You could pack a nice picnic lunch and easily spend your entire day there. The park itself is free, but if you're there, you have to go to the National Orchid Garden too. There is a nominal SG$5 fee to get into the National Orchid Garden, but it is absolutely worth it. Orchids are my favorite flower, so seeing all the different types in various shapes, colors, and patterns all in one place is just fabulous. Plus, the garden has designated “photo spots” for you to take the best pictures with the most beautiful backgrounds. It took us maybe 1-2 hours to walk through the Orchid Garden alone. Quite spacious and beautifully laid out.

The Botanic Gardens has a number of different sections for different types of plants. The Ginger Garden also caught my eye, but we didn't have enough time.

Word of advice: Make sure to bring an umbrella just in case. We were there at the end of monsoon season in November and we were caught in a torrential downpour! If it weren’t for our umbrellas, we would’ve soaked through.

Pros:
It is free (except for the National Orchid Garden hidden within the gardens), easy to access within the center of the city, has multiple access points and has its own terminal on the MRT route.

The National Orchid Garden within the garden is the only part of the garden that has an entry fee and it is only $5 Singapore dollars. It is stunning and well worth the cost.

We got lucky and had the opportunity to see two black swans interacting with the park maintenance crew as they gathered lake moss to use as fertilizer for the trees.

There are none unless you consider how large the gardens are and the time and energy needed to explore the whole thing. It is beautiful and an absolutely must see for any nature lover.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-26 10:00:05.126580

There is a paid orchid garden which we did not visit and though there is lots of construction work on new areas of the gardens, everything is fenced off so as not to disturb current garden patrons.

The children's garden is amazing. There is a tree house play area, a sensory garden, a maze (with movable gates so staff must change it frequently allowing local children a chance to never enter the same maze over time!), a garden cafe - a bit pricey but caters to the standard children's fare.

We spent 2 hours here and did not explore more than 30%.

It was also lovely to see so many locals enjoying picnics and lunch breaks in the gardens too - it added to the experience knowing that the gardens are well loved and appreciated by those that see them daily.

With younger children I would say the heat was a bit of a concern so take plenty of water and find the shade where you can.

It was a nice environment to see people enjoying themselves despite the humidity. Many shady areas for joggers and brisk walkers who need breaks. A bit of a problem would be the distance between toilets. So stop and go whenever you see a toilet because you wont know where the next one will be. Bring water and caps if you intend to stay long.
There are eateries within the park but it can be a little pricey, depemding on what you order. So if you can be bothered, bring and pack your own picnic. Great picnic spots all around. More than enough space for everyone.
Wear comfortable footwear and start exploring the variety of plants there. If you're lucky enough to spot chickens, squirrels, or snakes (I'm kidding!), stop and take a photo.

What I want to share is my personal review. Many locals who are well or not so well in health will choose to go to this Garden for morning walks, jog to,exercise. Reason is that not only the place is well maintained, the air here is cleaner.

If you are there early between 6 to 9 am ( opening hours is 5 am to 12 midnight) you can see many small groups of people doing various group exercises like line-dancing and tai chi.

Individuals are there too with many taking along their dogs to walk. It is a wonderful atmosphere.

Directions signages are clear. Toilets are clean and drinking water are available. You don't need to spend any money while inside this Garden as admission is free.

There is a restaurant and other food outlets if you are hungry though.

Late evening are visited mainly by romantic couples who spend their private moments under the trees.

If you are a tourist and have a free morning especially in weekends do spend an hour or two there.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-26 10:02:08.290490

A few tips : go in the early morning or after 5pm when the sun is not so hot. If going to the orchid garden, check the closing time to avoid disappointment. I think last entry is 6pm but am not sure. If you have kids under 8 yrs old you must visit the Jacob ballad children's garden. It has a treehouse and water play. Last entry 6:30 I think ...Bring dry spares. Take care that you use the Bukit tima road entrance as the children's garden is a Long walk from the main entrance. Ask a taxi driver to take you there / or take the mrt to Botanic Gardens as the mrt station is on that side. Lastly the Botanic Gardens is free. Only the orchid enclosure charges. Children garden is also free.

If you have done the Botanic Gardens , also try MacRitchie Reservoir or the Bukit tima nature reserve. The latter is only open sat/sun Til end 2016 as they are doing repairs.

1) always carry an umbrella per person visiting as the Singapore rains can disrupt your visit for just an hour in the whole day and it would be sunny again
2) if you intend to take pictures do wear a disposable raincoat instead. - that way you won't have to fumble with the umbrella and your expensive camera

Nearest MRT access is via the Botanic Gardens MRT (Circle and Downtown lines), which bring you to the Eco Lake (eastern) entrance of the park. My traditional entrance is via the NParks HQ, which brings you into the heart of the park. The park has a surprising amount of hidden treasures and habitat variety tucked away within a relatively compact 82 hectares, and without reference to the map, it's easy to miss some hidden treasures within the nooks and crannies. The National Orchid garden is a ""garden-within-a garden"", and additional charge is payable for entry to the orchid garden. Exploring the entire park may take surprisingly long - we took 60 minutes, and even then, missed out the Orchid gardens and many of the other sights. Peace and solitude are not a feature of this garden - even at early dawn, the park is filled with joggers and tai chi'ers. Crowds may thin out at midday as the park may get very hot under the tropical sun.
My personal parts of the garden to date: the evolution garden, which brings you through a Jurassic-park like history of plants. There are three separate lakes to explore, with the most dramatic being Symphony lake, where the ground gradually falls down a tended slope and ends with the symphonic platform.
There is something for everyone here: but you have to enjoy greenery and tended paths.",07-2016,Family,2020-01-26 10:03:13.821223

Many fitness freaks use the peaceful environment for their running activities without the chaos of the traffic and the associated noise.

It requires a certain basic level of fitness as the Botanical garden path is undulating and there are many instances of uphill and downhill slopes so the elderly need to proceed with caution. It's important to carry sunscreen as the garden is exposed to the elements. There are small covered wooden shelters for conducting picnics.

This is a unique place to locate swans both black and white in the various waterbodies. There are many sightings of monitor lizards especially around the water bodies but they are small and harmless. There are quite a few places to feed koi fish with specially prepared fish food.

The Orchid Garden is a must see attraction, though the entry fee is separate but reasonable. There is also a Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage in the centre of the garden. It is a wonderful atmosphere to listen to live music during concerts.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-26 10:03:28.506714

The only disappointing thing was that the water play area was closed. Our boys (6 & 8) loved the tree house play area as did we because we could just sit in the shade and watch them. The whole tree house play area is well shaded.
Do take lots of water as a didn't find too many places to refill our water bottles. For the main areas of the gardens, do take an umbrella as there are lots of open space which get pretty hot and sunny. We took and used umbrellas in these sections.
We headed to the main headquarters in the centre of the park for lunch. The adults shared a pizza and the kids had fish and chips. All were reasonable priced for such an establishment. The food was indeed lovely and the setting beautiful, even though it was busy (being a Saturday). Staff were very helpful and polite.
There is a lovely gift shop there that is a bit pricey but has some wonderful gifts for the botanically inclined.

Overall, it was a very pleasant and fun filled morning. It was amazing that we came across not one but two monitor lizards and a beautiful swan at the pond.

Advice to visitors is to wear casually and with comfortable shoes.

It is best to visit in the early morning as it is cool and while some of the walks are shaded many areas are not. Early morning is also the best time to see locals going about their everyday life such as jogging, walking dogs, picnicking or relaxing. Plants on the sides of the paths are labelled so there is plenty for the plant enthusiast to see and learn. In the small pond where children can wade in the shallows there are turtles which come quite close. We also saw many turtles and a strange lizard like creature in the large lake. During our visit we paid to enter the National Orchid Garden. As we had taken our four year old grandson with us we also visited the free Jacob Ballas Garden for children. Many children were enjoying the play areas, one with sand and slides and were also climbing a tree that had low thick branches. As well there were trees bearing fruit growing in this garden, an education for a child who had never seen tropical fruit growing.

It's never boring.

The one thing I really love about the Gardens is that its great for running in especially in the early morning (at 5.30 am) or late in the evening. One can just run the meandering paths from the main gates all the way to the back gate at Cluny Road, enjoying the coolness of the dark and greet the coming of dawn. You also get to see interest groups gathered for yoga, tai chi and other forms of exercises.

The Fragrant Garden and Healing Gardens are my favorite parts and I'll always plan it into my route just to breath in the soft fragrance from the plants. Best time to visit is in the early morning or evenings.",01-2016,Family,2020-01-26 10:04:41.962337

I remember when I was little my parents would bring my siblings and I there to feed the fish and swans (not so encouraged these days because the park wardens don't want the animals to get sick). So those times were wonderful times of simple fun.

Then when I was older, I brought my girlfriend there for many of our dates - she loves being near nature, and plants just make her happy. So the place became our favourite for long romantic walks in he evenings.

Well, eventually I married her :) And when the kids came along, SBC became one of our favourite places for family picnics and enjoying the free musical performances at the stage area. It was also a useful place to visit for the kids' botany projects from school. I still remember spending hours with them taking photos of different kinds of plant categories - and there are many, many varieties to study there!!

And now, the kids have all grown up, and I hear they sometimes go there for their dates with their special someone too! My wife and I still enjoy going there on our dates, and our favorite places are the Cool House and the Orchid Garden.

So yes, whether you are a resident in Singapore, or you are a visitor, I would recommend SBC as a ""must see"" - for the huge variety of plant life to learn from, for a romantic hiatus (especially in the evenings when it is cooler), for a place to bring the kids and the dog and to let them loose, or just a place to find some solace from the madness of everyday life.",12-2015,Family,2020-01-26 10:05:31.541515

We have found it to be an ideal place to go to escape the hustle and bustle of many parts of Singapore City.
The gardens are easily accessible by taxi, public transport or hop on, hop off bus tours.
Our most recent stay in Singapore again saw us visit the Botanic Gardens using the Singapore Airlines Hop on, Hop off bus as our means of access. We visited during the late morning on a Monday. Just like our previous visits, there were a few people there but it was not crowded by any means.
As it was approaching the hottest and most humid part of the day, it was important to stay in the shade as much as possible and to take things at a gentle pace. Staying in the shade was not a problem as there are plenty of shaded spots around the spacious gardens. Taking things at a gentle pace was a bit more of a challenge as there is much to see around Singapore and our time at the gardens was limited. A simple solution to this problem was to not try and cover everything in the gardens. Instead, we selected the area nearest the main entrance and explored that section of the gardens in depth.
All too soon, it was time to move on elsewhere. We did so, happy ion the knowledge that we had taken the time to again visit these beautiful, peaceful botanic gardens.

Meaning everything was orderly, clean, on time. Pedestrians waiting for the walk signal, never heard a siren or saw any police, no homeless people, no trash out of place. It was Disney World.

Very little traffic but that’s because not a lot of cars on the road because of the expense.
You buy a car and then pay 1.5 times the purchase price to register it for ten years. When your car reaches ten years old you must replace it! Singapore likes newer cars on their roads?
Taxis and trains were on time and very inexpensive.

Why music??
Botanic Gardens has got a big outside concert hall and a lot of musicians come to perform a free concert, including SSO who regularly has concert there.

It’s very nice to listen to live music, brink your own snack and drinks, just chill with your loved ones, in the nature outside!!!

There is so much green canopy to walk under, you don’t notice the heat or humidity at all. There are also enough snack stalls to get a drink or icy pole too. A set or restaurants occupy the central part of the gardens and we chose Halia. It had excellent food choices in a beautiful setting. Just be aware, depending on how busy the gardens are, you may need a booking. We managed a walk-up spot mid-week.
Probably the highlight is the National Orchid Gardens. I never knew there were so many difference varieties and colours.

,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Vincent M,645616463,14-01-2019,5,Overwhelming Unless You Pre-Plan,"The Singapore Botanical Gardens are wonderful, but cannot be digested in a single visual-and-intellectual feast, particularly if you plan on taking photos of anything beautiful, colourful, or spectacular. Both the garden’s sheer size and Singapore’s heat will work against you, I do have two recommendations to alleviate that issue, which I’ll make at the end of this review.

Tropical botanical gardens are always worth seeing. I’ve reviewed two others for TA: their similarities to the Singapore gardens are striking, but their differences are far more so: reflecting their different climates, locations, and collections. The Jardim Botanico in Rio de Janeiro (23 degrees S), the oldest of the three and a king’s private garden, focuses on Brazilian and Caribbean plants. Fairchild in Miami (26 degrees N) is the unluckiest: it’s collection was thoroughly devastated by major hurricanes twice, and its primary focus runs on plants from Bermuda to the Amazon. Singapore, on the other hand, is within 75 miles of the Equator, was an imperial city under the Raj, and is of course located on the opposite side of the globe. Singapore is not only (knock on wood) virtually typhoon-proof, but has reliable monsoons and abundant rainfall. Consequently, the look, feel, and flora on display of the Singapore Botanical Gardens is radically different from the other two, or any other tropical gardens.

You can discover quite a few reminders of the links to Old Blighty. Some areas of the gardens have carefully-maintained lawns (see Lawn photo) that with a bit of imagination, might remind you of Kensington Gardens, with Swan Lake taking the place of The Long Waters. Swan Lake also has a remarkable gazebo: British-made of cast iron around the time of the Sepoy Mutiny, and shipped off to the Old Admiralty House in the early decades of Queen Victoria’s reign. The gazebo is not only photogenic itself, but provides a splendid view of Swan Lake (see Gazebo 1 and Gazebo 2 photos). I should, however, warn you that both I and my charming companion were quite disappointed with Swan Lake: we didn’t see a single ballerina.

On the other hand, we were both delighted with Cave Falls; after looking in at it from the outside, we scurried around and looked out at it from the inside, which was blessedly cool and refreshing, a rare commodity out-of-doors in Singapore (see Cave Falls photo).

There are grimmer reminders of history in the garden. During the Japanese occupation, Japanese administrators took over control of the gardens, renamed them Shogon Gardens, and put British and Commonwealth POWs to work building brick steps (you can still see them just a bit northeast of the Frangipani Collection).

SBG has dozens of sub-gardens: healing gardens, ginger gardens, gardens focusing on traditionally important Malayan plants, and so on. The amount of information you could obtain—if you only had enough time—is overwhelming. I was quite surprised to learn that tumeric is not only a member of the ginger family, but the most valuable one in world trade; and, having once heard somewhere that tumeric had been used as a traditional dye for bright yellow Buddhist robes and other fabrics, I was intrigued to see a live tumeric plant, which was of course full of chlorophyll and bright green: the “tumeric yellow” bit comes from its underground rhizome (see Tumeric photo). There’s lots of remarkable tropical foliage to be seen, of course, (see Tropical Foliage photo), and impressive tropical flora from other continents, including a mahogany tree planted 40 years ago by Prime Minister Lee in his drive to make Singapore a city in a garden (see African Mahogany Tree photo). And you’ll see human ingenuity at work: fountains backed by artistically-arranged flora (see Fountain photo), an Elizabethan garden, and, of course, new, unique orchids invented right here. (TripAdvisor rightly considers the National Orchid Garden a separate attraction, and I’ll review it separately.)

However, even without the Orchid Garden, unless you’re an ardent gardener or professional botanist, your mind will numb over and legs give out long before you could possibly absorb everything here. I can think of two ways to overcome that challenge, depending on your schedule:

First: the garden is free, and open from 0500 to 2400 daily: nineteen hours a day. If you’ll be in Singapore for an extended period of time, you could revisit the Botanical Gardens often, wandering in around dawn or a hour before sunset, from either Tanglin Road or Bukit Timah, and focusing on one or two specific gardens. Repeat visits don’t cost you anything, and in the long term your rambles would be more pleasant and more informative.

Or two: if your schedule restricts you to one visit, perhaps only for three or four hours total, I’d recommend that you connect to the Singapore Botanical Gardens website before you even arrive in Singapore. Download the map and check out the guides, and then game out in advance a walking itinerary of the garden areas you’d most like to see within the time you can afford.

Disappointing as it is not to be able to do a comprehensive tour in a single visit, don’t miss this one! Go see as much as you can of this tropical paradise, particularly if you’re on holiday from someplace like Munich, Moscow, Minnesota or Manitoba.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-26 10:14:01.184206

We did visit the orchid gardens which was well worth the S$5 admission fee. There were plenty of places to sit and admire the orchids and many shelters to rest from the sun or shelter from the rain.

We saw many local people jogging, taking children for a walk, it was nice to see locals using the gardens like a local lark.

- the ""Palm"" valley (one of the largest in the world) is fantastic. Don't use the footpath but walk amongst the palms is a must. Lizards lurcking around just adds to the ambience.

Take a break at the cafeteria & watch the world go by.

The Gardens are free entry apart from the Orchid Garden which looked great from the outside but we ran out of available time.

There's plenty of tree shade cover to blank out the sun & even a waterfall to make you feel like Tarzan (if you remember that series.
The only negative, is the fitness gurus & joggers sharing the place. It detracts from the slow pace & finds you dodging the odd sweaty oncomer. A bit of jackhammer construction also found its way onto my home video audio background.

Well, this review is quite unuseful, since if you go there, the gardens are a must-see, as well as everything in the area.
Just a few cheap tips: if you use the subway to go there, don’t get the electic minibus that you find at the counters, just walk since it’s close and nice (the path). Check the schedule of the few things that happen at a certain time in the area: the mist and the sounds and lights show. Maybe also mixing it with the sounds and lights show at the bay.

Our visit to this world class botanic gardens eclipsed (In parts) our visit to the extraordinary (if not more contrived) Gardens by the Bay.

The gardens are significant in size and are well maintained.

We loved the palm collection and sweeping lawns, fragrance garden, foliage garden and so on.

A shame that the cordoned off Toxic plants garden was not open when we visited- it looked fascinating!

Signage indicating history, taxonomy and use of plants was good and in some parts of the gardens was excellent.

We also visited the special orchid garden (paid entry) which seemed like a glorified flower show.. if you love orchids you may look behind the contrived nature of this installation. Having said that the ticket entry was worth seeing the yellow orchid arches which was quite spectacular.

One could easily spend a full day or several half days meandering through the greenery.

So the ride took around 10min to the garden from center and can absolutely recommend Uber when you want to travel far and pay less.

We first tough that it would cost to enter but apparently it was free so we were happy,
First thing is to find a map because this I huge!

Bring walkable cloth and shoes because you’ll need it and a water bottle.

We were there for about 1h and that was enough, if you want to pay an extra cost to enter the flower area then put an extra 30min into the schedule.

I would definitely bring my dog, kid and friends here to have an chill day.
Don’t forget to walk down to the fountain where the swan & turtle is.

Let me know if you want me to visit something else in Singapore.

1. We were very tired at the time we got here and it would not be a great detailed review.
2. The park was so peaceful that we fall asleep at some point and slept close to one hour.
3. There are several paid areas in the garden and we did not visit them.

Said that... I can tell you the garden has been designed with accessibility in mind, you get to see a lot of parents with trolleys, pushing their kids around or you get to see elderly people walking easily and enjoying the view of the treetops.

The gardens offer a huge variety of flowers and plants from different parts of the world and Singapore, making the visit very interesting if you enjoy plants.
You will also see chickens running around! I was expecting other animals but not chickens. That made the visit a bit bizarre.

As part of your walk, you might end up in the tropical forest (or rainforest) area, this place is especially dangerous if you are tired, it was this wonderful wood benches, a nice shade and a soft breeze that puts you under in two minutes! We slept like babies for an hour and a half, just waking up as my stomach woke us up to an all mighty growl.

Hope you enjoy your visit as much as we slept through it. We did walk the gardens and most of what we saw was gorgeous, unfortunately, we slept half of our visit and had to go somewhere else.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-26 10:21:35.350984

It is surely one of the best attractions in Singapore and well worth a visit...and, over the years, it just gets better! Even a visit to the Orchid Garden within the complex is just $5 ($1 for Seniors from anywhere in the world).

Access to this UNESCO World Heritage Site is easy, via all sorts of transportation, but the most simple is the Singapore Underground (SMRT) which has a station immediately outside the Bukit Gate entrance and another at the other end of the garden, relatively nearby at Orchard Road ((Tanglin Entrance). My recommendation is via the Bukit Gate and simply walking a round trip incorporating all the main features of the gardens and returning to the same Station, this would be a walk of several kilometres but so worth it. There are rest rooms and food outlets throughout the gardens and there is a very good map available at the entrance, although signage is also good.

The pathways are easy walking, including disabled access slopes throughout. There are various themes to the gardens, but one of my favourites is the Evolution Garden, a well posted trip to the origins of the planet from a natural perspective – just don’t expect many flowers there!. In contrast, the fragrant garden is a sensory experience, the healing garden informative and the Palm Valley spectacular. However the jewel in the crown is undoubtedly the largest Orchid Garden in the world. It is simply wonderful, displaying over 1000 species and 200 hybrids…I defy you to agree on a single favourite…you will find many.

All garden themes are well laid out, spacious and it is easy to lose the crowds, even on the Sunday of the Chinese New Year. Of all the gardens in the world, and we have visited many, this is a “must”. Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.",02-2018,Couples,2020-01-26 10:23:04.979469

We revisited in an evening to take in the orchid garden and then strolled around in the cooler evening.

It's usually the first place we visit whenever we travel to this wonderful city. Every time we visit we see something new or a corner we hadn't seen before.
Firstly, it's free admission apart from the National Orchid Garden which only costs 5SGD ( concessions 1SGD). Probably the best time to visit is early morning when it's cooler and quieter. From our experience, it seems most organized tour groups arrive around about 10am and after and this means some areas become very busy.
Like any garden, work never stops and the Botanic Gardens continue to evolve which can mean some areas are closed but there is so much to see and admire time just flies!
This time, for us, there was a recently completed area with a boardwalk well up into the tree canopy which is certainly worth visiting. Paths meander through out the gardens and there are so many sections, it's almost impossible to visit them all on one visit.
In addition to a huge variety of trees, shrubs and plants, there are some fascinating sculptures dotted around which add to the overall attractiveness of the gardens.
The focal point for many visitors is the National Orchid Garden which is well worth the small admission fee. There are toilets nearby and a small but well stocked gift shop at the entrance/exit to the orchid collection.
Within the gardens there are several places for refreshment where weary feet can rest! The gardens are a smoke free zone which is another plus. Early morning is a popular time for joggers if you fancy some light exercise!
Pick up the very useful leaflet and map at the entrance which will guide you around. Depending where you are staying, there is an MRT station( Botanic Gardens Station).
What to take: comfortable footwear, fully charged camera or mobile phone batteries and if you're a keen gardener, a notebook and pen!

It covers a large area so a) you will need to be extremely fit and determined to cover all of it in a day or b) accept you can't see it all and slow down to take in the ambience of it all.
It tends to be reasonably busy between the main entrance and the orchid garden but not oppressively so and quieter the further you go away from there.

The orchid garden has many varieties in bloom for you to admire and wonder why yours at home don't grow that big.

The ""jungle walk"" as I like to call it, is a boardwalk which has 3 entrances (at different parts of the park, the easiest to find is opposite the orchid garden) and is surrounded by huge trees, both standing and fallen. Once inside, you feel like you have left the country and stepped into the jungles of Sumatra! Bird life is abundant, with some rare species to be seen if you are lucky enough to spot them in the trees or scurrying away between the shrubs. There are a few restaurants speckled around the gardens, ranging from fast food to fine dining. Halia is recommended, but be warned, it is not cheap!

The Orchid area was by far my favorite area with little signs explaining the genus(?) of the orchid and usually some former or current dignitary(from the world over) for whom the that new variety was dedicated/named after.

With just 2 stations from Newton and as the entrance is build just in front of the MRT station it could not had being more convenient for anyone who travel by train. The Garden is so huge I would have to come here every week in order to explore thoroughly. If you do not have the time of the world then i recommend to visit Eco Lake, Rain Forest is a must, the newly open Learning Forest is a delight. I recommend to bring hat, sunglasses and fan in order to enjoy the walk. Bring along a mat if you would like to have a panic.

You catch the MRT to Botanic station (orange or blue line - circle line / downtown line CC19 /DT 9). as you come out of the station, its clearly marked which way to exit to the gardens. It was drizzling a bit on the day we went, but an umbrella did the trick and the walk was most pleasant - it may have been rather humid without the drizzle. Shortly after walking in, there is an enquiry area, which provides a map of the gardens, so you will be able to go to those area's that you want to see, otherwise it will require a whole day if you want to see everything, and you will be exhausted after that. An amusing part for us, but also something that is seen as good, was that a young Chinese girl approached us to ask for directions to the exit - amusing as we are also tourists, but at least we had the map, so could assist, while the good part is that due to the younger generation learning English at school, the parents are now able to become more mobile by travelling to other parts of the world and not being restricted due to not being able to speak English. The walk is around 2.3km, and when you exit at the end of the gardens, you can catch a bus to the MRT station and then use the MRT back to your hotel.

Lee was there to meet and greet us, in fact, he found us vs. us finding him. It was less than a 30 minute drive to the Gardens and Lee dropped us off at the gate near the Orchid Garden. We split off into two smaller groups and agreed to meet back at the same spot by 1:30 pm (with Lee scheduled to pick us up by 2 pm). All aboard was announced to be by 2:30 pm, but we confirmed with staff on board that we could technically come back as late as 4:30 ish (as some of the Celebrity excursions wouldn’t be back by then); but as the ship had to collect all passports for the immigration officials, they had posted the time of 2:30 pm.

The Singapore Botanic Gardens was founded in 1859, following the initial botanic garden at Fort Canning (1822) by Sir Stamford Raffles. Since 1859, the Singapore Botanic Gardens boasts 82-Hectares of beautifully groomed grounds and varying landscapes (rainforest to orchids, for example) and over 150 years of history. The Gardens were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee (WHC) on 4 July 2015. The Gardens is the first and only tropical botanic garden on the UNESCO’s World Heritage List.

We explored the gardens at a leisurely pace, enjoying the carefully groomed landscaping, majestic trees, gorgeous flowers, and small lakes and ponds abounding with life of its own. We finally rested at a gazebo overlooking the Eco Lake, just in time, as a monsoon rain soon came upon us. We waited out the rain before heading back towards the Orchid Garden. We saw much wildlife along the way, but as birders found the Eco Lake a haven. From a stork-billed kingfisher, to white-breasted water-hens, to the migrant blue-tailed bee-eater – we were treated with a lovely selection of birds in one small area.
We would highly recommend to anyone visiting Singapore to visit the Botanic Gardens, a very natural and tranquil setting for a leisurely day with easy walking trails through varying botanical treasures.

Our group of five reconvened at the Orchid Garden for 1:30 and to our delight, Lee, our driver was also there to greet us early.. We decided to leave a half hour early, given the opportunity. Upon boarding the van, Lee presented to each of us a nicely chilled bottle of water. How thoughtful!

The landscaping might have had a lot to do with it because the undulations and slopes created such beautiful views of the magnificent trees. As soon as we entered, pleasantly surprised at the lack of a charge, we could tell this was a garden to be savoured in an unhurried way. The vivid greens of the grass, trees and shrubs contrasted with the brilliant colours of the flowers in this large, spacious garden.

We spent considerable time at Symphony Lake, watching a bright blue and brown kingfisher, and at the newer Eco Lake. We saw a huge Monitor Lizard swimming across one of the lakes, as well as turtles, carp and a pair of swans so perfectly set against the green surroundings. The variety of plants seemed endless and it was clear that much thought had gone into the precise location of them for maximum visual and natural harmony.

We reached the Orchid Garden and were happy to pay the small charge for entry ($1 for seniors). It was simply outstanding in its variety, quality and setting of thousands of exquisite orchids.

Singapore is a spectacular city with many attractions, but of all that we experienced there, the Botanic Gardens will linger in our memory as the place where we enjoyed a true paradise.",04-2017,Couples,2020-01-26 10:30:25.056102

There are maps available at the entrance to allow you to plan your route/s. These gardens are spread over several hectares with a few slight inclines and/or steps so be warned, sensible shoes are a must. We arrived on a hot, humid and showery day but this did not deter us nor devalue the visit. We purchased a couple of ""brollies"" on the way (buy before you get there, you can pick them up for about $3) The brollies were adequate to keep us pretty dry. We visited in mid July. The gardens are extremely well kept, well planned and very beautiful. During our visit we didn't feel we were in completion with loads of other tourists as the gardens offer so much open space. During good weather I would imagine it would be lovely to take the time to picnic in the grounds. There are also enough cafe's to cater and I did not feel they were over priced. I would try to carry as little as possible as even the rucksack we carried made us pretty sweaty!! I would recommend carrying a bottle of water to keep you hydrated. And then there are the Orchid Gardens - you do have to pay to enter these but it's reasonable and you get a great treat. The colours and varieties are amazing. You can't help but be impressed and my camera didn't stop clicking! There really is just so much to see. Take your time to walk around this part of the garden, every windy path reveals another beautiful flower.
Give yourself time for this visit. I would recommend you allow 2 - 3 hours, but it would be easy to stay for longer. Not sure I would take small children due to the amount of walking. We stayed for at least 3 hours. The only reason we left is that our legs were aching from all the walking! We loved every minute of it though.",07-2017,Couples,2020-01-26 10:30:25.408595

The plants are lovingly tended to by a large staff. The arrangement and organization of the various tropical plant species is done with great care. There is an orchid section with a number of varieties that were cultivated to honour the diplomatic and royal luminaries who have visited the city and the gardens over the years. The man made features of the gardens harken back to its British founders. I walk to the gardens four times a week to luxuriate in the vegetation. A must see in Singapore for one and all.

Meanwhile, you can see lovely animals everywhere in the garden, including squirrels, cocks and hens, and also a big lizard! As a nature lover, it is happy to see how animals are living freely and harmoniously in a park or garden like this, but not in a cage or a fenced area.
There was a jazz show while I visited in the evening. People just sat and had picnic on the meadow and enjoyed the jazz performance. You can check the events out from their page and have your wonderful evening. However, do bring along with your mosquitos repellent if you plan to do so.

Stunning,"We visited the gardens for a morning, on the day we were flying out of Singapore, and our time limitations didn't fully allow us to do the gardens justice. The whole place is pristine, and extremely good value. At the time of our visit it was 5 Singapore Dollars (SGD) approximately £2.50 and 1 SGD for over 60's. The gardens are well signposted and around every corner you can find stunning displays, ponds, lakes, fountains, arches, structures and amazing vistas that provide repeated photographic opportunities to snap some incredible photos. Singapore is a very green city and the botanic gardens exemplify the skills and expertise of their gardeners. We were told that the Singaporeans have undertaken an innovative project to connect all the parks by walkways, for the benefit of the city which gives you some idea of the pride they rightly have in their amazing parks and gardens.

We were also lucky enough, along with other visitors, to see 2 separate monitor lizards harmlessly moving through the vegetation.

The gardens are peaceful and well-developed. There are so many different aspects to explore that one visit won't be enough to experience it all. I'd recommend the Evolution Garden and the walk through the rainforest. We saw a pair of nesting hornbills just off the path that enters the rainforest just past the Visitors Centre.

The biggest negative is its biggest attraction: the Orchid Garden, reportedly the largest in the world. It was crowded with tourists at a price with the remainder of this wonder, free, and relatively only sparsely peopled, at least on this day.

The jewel of this entire site is perhaps the Evolution Garden found essentially in the center of this botanical pleasure. Day or night there is something for anyone interested in flora and some fauna. Our 4 hours were well spent. However, even in early March a refreshing shower (sauna) was very welcome post visit.

Tip: Mosquito repellants. Apply generous dosage of it for they are resilent and persistent. And while you are at it, make sure you are hydrated with spare bottles of water.

The main part of the Botanic Garden is set into a hill – with a mixture of steps and paths on offer – the orchids are a main draw – especially the VIP area – here are the varieties named after Nelson Mandela, Margaret Thatcher, William and Kate etc. – but there is much more to see amongst the intricate planting schemes including pieces of sculpture, large lizards and birdlife including a large hornbill.

Swan lake has a tremendous sculpture of swans flying up from the water and there is a delightful Victorian summerhouse at one end overlooking the water. A must visit within the gardens is the Orchid garden. You do have to pay to enter, which for us senior citizens amounted to $1 each. This is the most incredible display of orchids, not I. A greenhouse, but planted in beds and on trees, and the layout is continually being rethought and replanted. Outside, and next to the Orchid garden is the Ginger garden; again worth a walk through, since as with everywhere else, there is a plethora of information as well as plant varieties. You may be lucky to visit when the Shaw auditorium is in use. A lovely performance space in an expansive green oasis.

There are lakes, fountains, waterfalls and some wonderful sculptures positioned around the garden. It's popular with locals and tourists alike and probably the best time to visit is in the morning or evening when it should be slightly cooler. Clearly there is a lot of hard work undertaken to maintain these gardens ....paths are clearly signposted and most, if not all, the plants are labeled. There are plenty of seats to rest those weary feet and various cafes around to buy a cold drink.
The botanic gardens are a collection of individual gardens all with their distinctive charecter and the gardens, as all gardens should, continues to develop with new projects underway. In one part of the garden, which we found particularly fascinating, are steps built using bricks made by prisoners of war in Singapore charecterised by an arrow on the brick face.
There are some magnificent trees and it's not difficult to spot various birds and insects. The gardens display nature at its best and hopefully it will make people wonder why we are so intent on destroying it.
If you are only in Singapore for a few days, visiting the Botanic Gardens should be a priority! Make sure camera batteries are fully charged and a notebook and pen available. You won't be disappointed.",11-2016,Couples,2020-01-26 10:39:15.810747

As others have noted, buy a bottle of water before you enter, because vending machines are hard to come by, the main cafe and gift shop are toward the middle of the gardens and it will take a while to get there, you can imagine it can get quite warm. Bring a hat and grab a map as you enter. If visiting on a Saturday they have free guided tours listed on their website, you'd get a lot out of those.

Some features I'd recommend, the little herb garden, the healing garden which has over 400 varieties of plants used for medicines with descriptions along the way. Also the fragrant garden, National Orchid garden (separate entry free but utterly worth the small fee), the ginger garden next door to that and then treat yourself to a leisurely stroll toward Tanglin gate.

From here you can walk (about 20 mins in the heat) or call a cab to go to Long Beach seafood restaurant @ Dempsey for black pepper crab or singapore chilli crab and have a wander through the Dempsey Hill area.

We thought 2.5 hours would be ample time to wander through the gardens, we're brisk walkers and we're not usually too fussed about gardens, not having a green thumb between the two of us, but we wished we had at least 3.5 hours. We had to rush to get to a restaurant booking afterward.

It was definitely worth the visit to see the different fauna, read all the interesting information in the healing garden, and see all the amazing orchids. Just be mindful, it can get hot so wear a hat",09-2016,Couples,2020-01-26 10:41:42.710941

They combine areas of natural rainforest with large open grassed areas on one hand, and highly cultivated display gardens on the other. Not a leaf is out of place-- that may be a bit ""un- natural"" but it doesn't detract.

For us the highlight was the orchid garden, where hundreds of orchids of different shapes, sizes and colours were beautifully presented.

A favourite for me is the orchid garden. There are plenty of signs around showing the directions. The orchids are 1.2 Km walk within the gardens, from the station, and all the signage shows how many more metres you need to walk until you get there. Being somewhat older, it took us quite some time to walk to the orchids and we were very tired when we had finished seeing what we wanted so we took a taxi back to the hotel.

It also has a children's garden, and allows pets (on a leash). It's a popular place to spend a day, for both Singaporeans and visitors. And it has earned recognition as a World Heritage site from UNESCO, giving a global endorsement to its quality. Interesting that it was nominated as a Cultural Site, which is certainly appropriate given the role it plays in science, technology, and tourism.

It is easy to locate and there are numerous hard surfaced pathways that are suitable for wheelchairs and well sign posted at reasonable points to enable the area to be navigated. A variety of boards showing your location and where you may wish to go are listed alphabetically in English.
The park is packed with joggers of all shapes, sizes and sexes, clearly indicating how safe it is for women and children alike. It was also nice to notice the dogs on leads being taken for walks, or being carried, and the water fountains used by both people and animals alike (not to my liking).
There are literally hundreds of trees of many varieties, but all having come from warmer climates that supported the growth of them. The information boards provided gave some background as to their origin and reminded the visitor of the part Europeans paid in developing Singapore to what it is today.
There is a large lake with a central island and this perhaps is the nesting area for the two white swans. Walking round, a small ""monitor"" lizard, rodent, squirrel and a variety of birds meant that our interest was kept alive during a particularly hot day. That the Europeans only ""suffered"" from the heat was obvious, as the various families played games, ate their food and generally used the area in the old fashioned ways a park used to be used,

A magic place. A small downside was that near the entry we bought two almond magnums which had cold frozen chocolate coatings but liquid ice cream inside! A clever trick, but not good for eating! Perhaps it is a good idea not to try to see all the gardens in one visit. For $10 you can take a taxi to the south end, and then similarly take a taxi back from the centre. I loved the beautiful sculpture by the south entry, and also the swans sculpture in Swan Lake.

If all you want is a gentle walk through interesting trees and shrubs, this is for you. If you are a serious student of tropical botany, you will find nowhere better to study the results of nearly 200 years of endeavour. Take your camera, and take your time - allow at least half a day. The best place to start is at the main entrance, although taxi drivers will want to drop you off at one of the other gates, as it will be then easier for them to pick up another fare.
Start by looking at the specialist sections to the east of the entrance, and wander round the large lake.
If you have not seen it before, pay the small extra to see the orchid garden.
We then recommend you to meander slowly down to the Tanglin Road gate, not forgetting the interesting modern sculptures.

Before shopping or buying a MRT/ticket you will need local currency the Singapore $. In 2016 around $2 per £1. When changing stirling often the highest exchange rate is in the country you are visiting.
Only take $10 bills as the highest denomination, as it is easy to pay in $10 multiples, rather than pass over a $50 bill and then have to count quickly, whether you have the correct change. In a hurry it can be an unnecessary stress.
With One whole day to spend in Singapore, there are three Must Do’s.
1. Have an early start and go to theBotanical Gardens - Pick up the MRT Circle Line to Botanical Gardens. This Garden is a UNESCO World Heritage Park. Not to be missed. The paths are well sign posted, leading to 3 lakes with fish and terrapins. The park has many specimen Heritage trees. If you like Orchids, you will have a treat. If you are not sure about Orchids you will be blown over by the varieties. This garden has 1000 species and 2000 hybrids. Also visit 6 different themed gardens, Healing-Fragrance-Foliage-Evolution-Ginger-and Childrens gardens.
There is no charge to enter the Botanical Garden. Open from 8am to 6pm.
The Orchid Garden is free to children-50p ($1) for pensioners and £2.50 ($5) for visitors below 60 years old. Money well spent!

2. Raffles Bar – After lunch and your visit to the Botanical Gardens, experience a Gin Sling at the Raffles hotel.

3. Marina Bay Gardens – Having relaxed in the bar, take the MRT to Marina Bay Gardens. There is plenty to see and two enormous glass domes filled with tropical trees and plants. In the evening the gardens are floodlit.
To add to your experience and very close; view the Marina Sands Hotel that is like a yacht suspended in the sky. From exiting the gardens, the hotel can be visited via an escalator. Once in the hotel you can make your way down to the basement that has an air conditioned shopping mall, with many places to eat.
It also has a Gondola to sale on.

,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/CambridgeElizabeth,351996199,01-03-2016,5,A wonderful 'must do',"Definitely a 'must do' on a visit to Singapore. First established in 1859 it is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is internationally recognised as a leading institution of tropical botany and horticulture. Going back as far as the 1920s new techniques in raising orchids were pioneered and in the National Orchid Garden you'll find the largest display of orchids in the world. But you don't have to be passionate about orchids or even a gardener to enjoy a visit. It's a wonderful 'green lung' for the people of Singapore who visit to walk, stroll, jog, run, picnic and relax. Visit in the early morning or early evening when it's cooler. Some of the paths are quite a steep climb and challenging in the midday heat. We travelled by MRT to the Botanic Gardens stop on the Blue line which is right next door to the Tanglin Gate entrance. The Gardens are open from 5am to 12 midnight daily and entry is free with a small charge for the National Orchid Garden. You'll also find signage to a Ginger Garden, a Healing Garden (open 5am-7.30pm, closed on Tuesdays except when Tuesday is a pubic holiday), a Fragrant Garden, a Foliage Garden and an Evolution Garden. The National Orchid Garden is open from 8.30am to 7pm daily admission is $5 for adults and $1 for senior citizens 60 years and above and free for children 12 years and under. There is also a free to enter Children's Garden for children 12 years and under which is open 8am-7pm although it's closed on Monday except when Mondays are public holidays.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-26 10:49:02.761403

We spent 4 hours here & still did not manage to see all. Expect alot of walking.

Some interesting features & things to look out for while here....

1. Go to the huge pond & stand near the edges. Immediately you can see many big fishes ( black/orange) start coming towards the edge when they see you & all looking up at you together - 'waiting' for food to be thrown to them.

They seems to know what to do when someone comes near- gesturing & hoping for food to be thrown in ( see photo). They just stay there until you move away.
Amazing, & very intelligent fishes.

2. Look out for really big lizards while strolling the paths ( not sure if these are salamanders or monitor lizards). Looks intimidating! Don't go too near them ( see photo).

3. There are many unique looking, colourful & beautiful flowers /plants all over. Haven't really seen these anywhere else ( see photos).

4. Healing & Ginger Gardens - amazing what one can learn from these 2 unique gardens about all the healing powers of so many common plants ( see photos).

5. Visit The Gardens Shop. Here one can find many nice & very interesting souvenirs related to flowers/plants. Many of which can only be found here as they are not general types of souvenirs.

The shop at the main entrance area near Visitor Centre is much bigger & has more items than the one at National Orchids Centre.

6. Food- a must for everyone. There are various dining outlets inside but if one yearn for fast food, there is one big McDonald's outlet just outside the Botanic Gardens MRT station, before you enter the garden .

Once you are on street level, you can see Botanic Gardens on the right& Cluny Court mall on the left ( a small mall of few shops/dining). Behind Cluny Court is a small tyres/batteries shop, followed by another small mall called Serene Centre. McDonald's is located on ground level of Serene Centre.",02-2016,Couples,2020-01-26 10:49:51.793036

I was fortunate enough to see a family of turtles swimming in the lake and then gathering on the edge of the gardens - a great photo opportunity. The wild roosters running free are a surprise but delightful nonetheless.

I caught the MRT in the late afternoon to visit the gardens; the trip was easy and the station stops at the Gardens so you can enter directly after exiting the station.

People smile and greet you ad they walk pass you. Being alone in this heritage garden is like somewhat having a brief personal retreat. You slow down to look at the flowers, different shapes of leaves and the changing colours. Oh yes, there are still swans in the ponds. One of the highlights for many.

,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Andy L,673468726,12-05-2019,5,A Beautiful Garden,"Really hard to know what to recommend to people who are heading to Singapore. We were lucky to be there for nearly two weeks and could do loads of things, but still not everything!!! You will find loads to do, but four recommendations, which we loved.

**1. Raffles Hotel Long Bar for Singapore Slings - we had three on our first visit, which wrote the rest of the day off. We did two on the second visit!!!! Expensive, but you can't do Singapore without one. Long Bar is the only thing open at the moment. Hotel re-opens in full, after renovations, in August.

**2. Chinatown lovely for a wander and food - we went daytime and lunchtime and we enjoyed as Food Stalls - cheap and wonderful food - S$8.00 for Duck set meal. Most of shops/stalls sell nonesense, but I got some shirts and it is worth hunting around. Couple of interesting Temples to visit.

**3. Little India for a wander and Food - we did this in the evening and it was a fun time, bustling place. Loads of places to eat and the amazing Mustafa Shopping Mall. It sells everything and is open 24-7. It seems it is where everyone {locals} shop. Check outs are as mad as Primark on speed!!!

**4. The Botanic Gardens - the original and BEST one, a short Metro ride out of City, but only a couple of stops. National Orchid Gardens, within the Botanic Gardens, are also a stunning place. S$5.00. Main Botanic Gardens are free!!!!!!

If time allows ……

5. Gardens by the Bay - the two Domes - Cloud Forest & Flower Dome are great. Floral Fantasy is a bit tacky, but if you buy an all inclusive ticket there is a 4D Show which is a bit of silly fun.

Other Tips ….

A. Tourist Metro/Bus Tickets can be bought for 1, 2 or 3 Days, from main Metro Stations, but not all. We got ours from Chinatown and City Hall. Metro is quick, clean and efficient. These are stations easy to find that have ticket offices.
Orchard
City Hall
Raffles Place
Bayfront
Harbourfront
Chinatown
There is a S$10.00 deposit for your Tourist Travel Card and 3 Days Travel was S$20.00. You hand in your card at the end of your stay and get S$10.00 back.

B. Wine is expensive in Hotels. We paid between S$53.00-$115.00, but in 7-11 Stores it is around S$22.00 for a decent bottle. So we sometimes bought a bottle for our Hotel Room if relaxing in the evening. Red Wine often comes chilled, but it worked for us.

C. Taxis are cheap for City trips, S$6.00-S$8.00, particularly between Hotels and main Metro Stations, which is easiest way to grab one. There are Hotels, major ones, everywhere.

D. I know people will find the Historical side of Singapore interesting. We didn’t do a lot of this. Fort Canning was having a facelift and we only did a little of the Colonial District. If on Sentosa, Fort Siliso is worth a visit for a little insight into Singapore during World War II",05-2019,Solo,2020-01-26 10:53:20.561418

I visited their orchids too but at the time it was midday and extremely hot and I did not want to be in the heat any longer so I didn't pay the admission ticket to go instead. Though since it was March holiday, Singapore residents and PRs got free admission which is pretty awesome way to promote the exhibit.

It started with the knowledge of the first rubber trees in the region were grown in SBG. So, I went in search of the rubber tree that was still standing there. That was many years ago. Most of my visits since then were for events organised in Botanic Gardens by various organisations or parties. Each time I visit, I discover something new. During my most recent visit, I have the privilege to be toured by my ex-student, now a horticulturist at the SBG. Armed with slightly more knowledge of local plants, the visit was more meaningful than any of my earlier visits. Only with some knowledge will one appreciate the effort the staff have put to grow some of these plants. If you are a resident, have sufficient spare time in your hands and love plants, get the handbook of local plants in the public library before you start exploring the botanic gardens. It is therapeutic. Lol.

There is no admission fee for Singapore Botanic Gardens but the National Orchid Garden within the main gardens charges $5 entrance fee. There are several landmarks in the Garden.

Nowadays, the beautiful gazebo surrounded by a ring of Yellow Rain Trees is a most celebrated place by photographers - especially for wedding shoots.
2- Prisoner-of-War Brick Steps which are made by the prisoners of war during the Japanese occupation, 1942-1945. As a sign of defiance, the PoWs engraved arrows on the bricks to indicate that they were imprisoned which are still visible.
3-Tanglin Gate is the main gate to the Garden and is a cast iron gate that is very striking and gorgeous.
Other attractions in the Garden include a Fernery, Sundial, Ginger Garden, Bonsai Garden, Rainforest, the Palm Valley, Waterfall, Library of Botany and Horticulture.

Close to the orchid garden was the collection of different palm trees (Palm Valley) which according to the sign needed a significantly larger plot of land as to accommodate the large number of varieties and sizes. They provided some shade on the large lawn area in front of the stage. Nearby there also were small stalls selling hot food items, drinks and orchid plants.

The rainforest section was quite a bit darker (even the posted signs warned about this) and cooler as we walked on a raised walkway throughout. Here we able see a lot more wildlife in the underbrush of which the lumbering lizard probably garnered the most attention by the visitors.

Evolution Garden showcased how plants have evolved over millions of years.

It was a nice and relaxing experience. Also the day was not too hot or humid so I could better enjoy exploring. Unfortunately I ran out of time but definitely I will be back.",03-2019,Solo,2020-01-26 10:53:54.431370

There is also the gift shop which sells lovely gifts and floral clothes, objects, onamemrs etc which is a good takeaway souvenir from Singapore.

The soft twittering of birds is soothing while a chance sighting of a magnificent cockerel pecking at the undergrowth is most welcome.
Signage is good, you’ll never get lost, and the botanical features are explained in some detail as you walk past interesting species.
Particularly love the helicon, so bright and luscious, slim bamboo groves and banana trees, so tropical while the lake has some little statues like the little boy holding a turtle, cute. Then, you might come across a couple of black swans waddling up from their swim!
Cafes are quite over priced, Casa Verde and Halia, for instance, and we’re not even talking about the gourmet Corner House which is very fine dining.

Singapore has the tropical weather all year around, so the park is covered with greenery any time you visit. Yet we have new discoveries each visit as the plants and flowers show us different faces each day and each morning and afternoon.

The highlight is the Orchid Garden. It only costs 5 dollars to enter and can enjoy many kinds of Orchids with many photo spots.

My personal favorite is Ginger Garden. You cannot believe how many different species of ginger group exist in the southeast Asia, and many of them bloom uniquely beautiful flowers in the vivid tropical colors. Some look like a colorful bird. Their leaves are also shiny and beautiful. Currently there is an exhibition of sketches and paintings of gingers and the garden by the local artist, which inspired me of the art of drawing the nature. This is really worth viewing.

I from 2006-2007, I visited the park 4 times a week to practise my rope skipping and burn much calories while enjoying the beautiful views of the gardens.

I usually start off by doing a walk-jog around the gardens past the 2 swan lakes for about 20 minutes before stretching my body and getting to jump rope for another 90 minutes. There is something magical about the Botanic Gardens.

I love the coping walk where you can see the open field and watch families and friends have a great time playing or just enjoying the fresh air. I love the concerts that are arranged there on some weekends and listening to music in the park.

Exercising in the Botanic Gardens is one of my go-to places. I love the restaurants with amazing fine dining or casual meals (healthy too!) and the visitors shop has some quirky things to purchase and Tak home too. The carpark is very accessible from the main entrance and the energy and vibe there is very different from the other parks.

I used to also hold my bootcamps with clients there for a few years. Abundance of space for all to share. Now with more features and walking trails, this park is definitely a place one MUST explore. Local and international cuisine options nearby and plenty of choices to choose from.

I cannot wait to go back and visit again. I want to relive my experiences there all over again. Botanic Gardens, you have never failed to make my day whenever I come and visit you, rain or shine.",07-2017,Solo,2020-01-26 10:56:03.502662

For me the better way of experiencing this garden is to start at its Southeast entrance near Holland Road & Cluny Road junction. If you take the road on the left it will eventually lead you to the Swan Lake. After that it's up to individual to explore the rest of the vast garden.

Well stick around and I will tell you.

It’s the last tree of its kind. The last one. You will not see it anywhere else in the world.
That alone is the reason to visit Singapore Botanic Gardens.

There are descriptions near some of the trees, and although it sounds a little bit tedious to read all these descriptions, believe me it’s not.

One of great things about Singapore Botanic Gardens is that it is completely free. I mean if you want to see the famous orchid garden you will have to pay the ticket, but everything else is completely free.

Regarding orchid garden - it’s really a sin if you don’t visit it, and ticket will only set you back for 5$. Take also in account that I’m a guy who is telling you that it’s well worth your time if you go look at “some flowers”.

Somewhere in the middle of the gardens there are few interesting restaurants where you can order some of the kind drinks and food is on acceptable level.

The best part of the year to visit the gardens is between June and August, since most of the flowers are blooming in that part of year.

Also if you didn’t know already it’s worth mentioning that Singapore Botanic Gardens are a considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

To conclude this review let’s just say that the Gardens are one of those areas which are very hard to describe with words. They are truly something unique and beautiful- so stop waisting your time and go and see them.",02-2018,Solo,2020-01-26 10:57:08.389651

If you are a student you get in for free also.

Plenty of restaurants - as well as drink vending machines throughout. Very dog friendly (but dogs must stay on leash). If you go off the paved paths - do wear shoes suitable for soggy grounds.

My long term memory is still first rate and I recall with great clarity that visit and quite a few after that.

It was a Sunday ritual to drive from Woodlands to the Gardens for a walk and then to the Singapore Cricket Club for lunch plus afternoon tea. I recall on one visit watching Monkeys playing on a tall bush, they would climb to the top and roll down on the branches and then repeat the whole process again. From time to time we saw the odd snake but they would slither away from us very quickly.

Today there are many attractions there including one of the best Orchid Gardens I have ever visited. The Gardens have been classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and this is so richly deserved.

I would like to think that my parents spirits still visit this wonderful place. I try to on every visit to Singapore to see the Orchids and have a walk down memory lane.

For me it is the right mix of curated, non curated, selvage. Before I came by bus ( close to Tanglin Mall) and went home by subway MRT. In this way I was sure to be eco friendly and I did the whole park. But recently a friend of mine indicated to me the car park at Cluny Road ( Nassim Gate) close to the shops and Casa Verde. I will use Nassim Gate and the car park only during the week. Some of my friends practice Yoga in the park, some come for running ....I just love the flowers, the big space and being right in the middle of the city without paying anything!
The atmosphere in the evening is also very nice but keep in mind that only the main paths are illuminated.
If you are a flower geek don't miss the Orchid Garden .....the small entrance fee is worthwhile!

If at all possible, try to visit the orchid garden first,before tour buses start rolling in around mid-morning.

The botanic gardens are laid out nicely (started back in 1859!) so it appears that they cover a much larger space than the 82 hectares, about half the size of Central Park in NYC. Most of the vegetation is tropical, although they also have a desert garden. Some of the mature trees are over 100 years old and 50 feet or more in height. A few are over 250 years old. I have been in botanic gardens in many countries, but in typical Singapore fashion this garden is spotlessly clean.

The largest attraction in the park is the incredible orchid garden with an amazing collection of orchids of every possible color.

My favourite is the Tropical Rainforest trail. In one visit, one can learn so much about tropical flora. There are so many little nooks, twists & turns in the track, yet it's pretty easy to find one's way around, as the Botanical Garden is small. If one has in mind to have a picnic, there are plenty of open spaces to set oneself down. In the area nearer to Jacob Ballas Children's Gardens, there are even sheltered Gazebos & a second swan lake with black swans.

A visit in the late afternoon or early morning is probably best. Set aside more than 2 hours if you want to see it all (and there is a lot to cover).

The gardens can largely be divided into 2 halves:

1. The original gardens next to embassy row on Napier Road where you enter by the Tanglin Gate. There's massive construction going on outside for an extension of the MRT system so the approach to this side of the gardens is likely to be marred by ugliness some some years. But do persist as the older part of the gardens have a lush mature feel you don't get in the other half.

Here you will find swan lake, the rainforest garden, the WWII POW brick steps, symphony park (where there are occasional public concerts) and the ginger garden.

The National Orchid Garden - the only fee paying part of the gardens are located here as well.

2. The newer half has entrances at Cluny Gate (conveniently next to the Botanic Gardens MRT station) and if you are driving or taking a taxi, at Nassim Gate.

This half feels more manicured. The highlights for me were the healing and fragrant gardens and the Jacob Ballas children's garden with its fountains.

At the weekends, the park is a popular spot for picnics and a meeting point for many of Singapore's domestic helper population.

One thing could be improved - the casual family style cafes are somewhat basic and spaced quite far apart. There are vending machines for drinks located around the park but not many so bring some bottled water with you.

There are a few upscale restaurants located within the park for those who want to indulge - I think these are mainly dinner rather than lunch options.",04-2016,Solo,2020-01-26 11:03:14.186034

Not many know that Raffles himself was a keen naturalist, and he developed the first ‘Botanical and Experimental Garden’ at Fort Canning. In 1859, all his efforts culminated in the founding of the Gardens at its present site. The Botanic Gardens is als connected with Lond's Kew Gardens because Kew-trained botanists had a hand in its development in its early days. As the main place from which the harvesting of the rubber tree was researched, it also played a pivotal role in the early economy of Malaysia.

This attraction is a well-maintained assortment of gardens worth taking a stroll through - and which will cost you nothing! There is a large pond with swans in it, and back in those days when I was schooling, monkeys also used to roam the place!

When I was a boy my parents - like many other parents - used to brings us kids here to have picnics or to appreciate the greenery and the flowers. Because it is nice - and free. Among the places which left a tinge of nostalgia for me as a kid was the Sun Clock, the animal-sculptured plants and the Pavillion.

Performances and concerts are held here from time to time, and for food lovers, there is also a food court, resturants, cafes and other eateries. And you can shop at Gardens Shop after eating.

This place is ideal for cycling or running. And running can be done either within the gardens, or outside along the road acting as its perimeter, as the gardens is bordered by Holland Road, Evans Road and Bukit Timah.

There is also a herbarium, a lab and a library which may be of interest to botanists or enthusiasts.

Personally, I like to take walks through the Rain Forest in the Central Core and along the Swan Lake, as I find these walks stress-busting and recuperative.

The good thing about this place is that its accessibility. It is within walking distance from Orchard, and one of its exits is served by Botanic Gardens MRT station.",09-2015,Solo,2020-01-26 11:05:17.483307

It's easy enough to get there by public transportation, and the reception has a ton of brochures to help you navigate your way through the garden. Try it for a quiet and leisurely morning, especially if you have time to kill.

(I went around on a click-happy mission snapping photos of the various statues and sculptures in the garden. You don't have to, but it was what intrigued me about the garden! The brochure was a tremendous help in helping me explore the area, and sure enough, I'd spent close to 4 hours in this place without realizing it!)

A popular place to visit for most people who come here, so try arriving early in the morning, where your only companions are other like-minded travellers and the fitness enthusiasts.

One of the most serene and calm places I have ever been to.

P.S: Do carry water and a light snack. Also, there is a LOT of walking involved, so wear comfortable shoes and clothing.

The only positive thing is the nearby botanical garden. Meal was forgettable and poor. Service abysmal and they could care less about the customer. Tables not set up as asked; they argued. Then they served “family style” dishes for each table (nice concept) but NOT ENOUGH PORTIONS ON THE PLATES FOR EACH PERSON!!! For instance, at our table of 8 people, they served a basket with 4 rolls only and a chicken dish with only 6 pieces!!! When we complained, they only brought more portions for some of the food AND THEN CHARGED US EXTRA ON THE BILL. So we paid extra just to have one portion per person, when they knew exactly how many people we were going to be. The waiters and waitresses were totally disinterested during the meal and the manager at the end totally unapologetic. You could see that customer satisfaction was the LAST thing on his mind.

A UNESCO heritage site, the gardens stand with the best in the world (e.g., Kew Gardens). Planted sections are arranged thematically and include a significantly sized virgin tropical rain forest, an evolution garden that features plants you would have seen if you lived in the age of dinosaurs, an orchid garden with flowers in shapes and sizes you would see only in the wild tropics and a thriving desert scape. They are separated by wide and smoothly paved pathways which are ideal for early morning jogs or late afternoon strolls. Ample shade is provided by towering heritage trees that dot the wide swaths of green open space.

As with Central Park in Manhattan, Singapore's park is a gift to the people with free access. I couldn't believe how huge this development is. I was there two hours and only saw about half of it. The gardens are beautiful and immaculately maintained, and there was no litter in sight. There is also a great mix of wide thoroughfares and small paths. We saw people picnicking and biking, but this did not seem to be a place for more active pursuits like frisbee or rollerblading. My one critique is that this park seemed very ""managed"" with almost nothing that allows nature to show off on its own accord. I admit this is a personal preference. I give my thanks and appreciation to those who provide such a beautiful gift to the public.",09-2017,Business,2020-01-26 11:08:11.348952
,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/finesilver,528163496,29-09-2017,5,"Wonderful, well worth the UNESCO World Heritage designation","This is a place ranked exceptionally high on this site and in every tour book and online site. With good reason. It is simply wonderful.

Not right in downtown, but a 20 minute taxi ride away (it is past the end of Orchard Road). Worth the effort to get there, there is a MTR stop there also.

The Gardens were the first entry by Singapore to become a UNESCO world heritage site which is a huge deal, well deserved by the way.

I saw part of the Gardens including the National Orchid Gardens of course and the adjacent Ginger Garden with its lily ponds and waterfall.

The entry is stunning too and is well worth a panoramic photograph on your phone or two. There is a waterfall there. Admission is free except for the Orchid Garden.

There are several lakes, one called swan lake which was most memorable too. There is also a healing garden and a perfectly placed bandstand with a grassy area there and a small pond just by the stage which only further enhances an already brilliant setting. Also, there are several sculptures and other art features throughout the Gardens, some real cool ones from the visitor's center walk to the Orchid Gardens. There is a children's garden and a rain forest that I did not personally visit.

I loved the setting, unique greenery and flowers and flowering trees and plants. Spotlessly clean. Lots of families visiting the Gardens too. I went early which was recommended to miss some of the heat and humidity.

Oh, one more tip, getting out of the Gardens is a little challenging, even though there is a taxi stand, there were no taxis in sight, also, I could not get an Uber signal from there either. Also, there are phone numbers of taxi companies there to call for a taxi, right as I was calling, one pulled up to drop some people off so I was ok. Just please be mindful of this dynamic in your planning. As I said, there is a MTR stop within the one edge of the Gardens.

The Orchid Garden was only 5 SGD to get into and well worth the amount. The flowers here are delightful and really very pretty, I never knew how many Orchids our world has to offer, they even have one named after Margret Thatcher!
After browsing through the shop there and spending a small fortune we headed up into the rain forest for a 10km walk, seeing pretty trees that rode so far above our heads it blocked the sunlight, to weird and wonderful creatures lurking in the beneath of the trees.

Spacious garden with various shades of green simply charms me in a quite serene atmosphere in spite of located in the midst of the busiest area of Singapore. My preference is visiting there early morning or before 10 am as the weather here in Singapore is quite hot during day. I have never ventured here at night or evening.
The garden presents many plants from the huge trees to very tiny lovely flowers of different kinds. The garden authority has improved this place a lot for the last two decades though recently some people feels the open area of Symphony stage has become smaller and losing its old charm. I have also noticed for quite some time there are quite interesting statues among the trees and plants which are nicely blended into the scenery. This place is a must for those who love nature. There is a must-visit beautiful Orchid Garden too.",03-2019,Friends,2020-01-26 11:12:44.502728

The only dampener, is after sunset, this whole garden is quite poorly lit and the signage in and out of the garden can be confusing.

I’m giving 3 star, because they have a beautiful small pond at the edge of this garden but quite poorly maintained. That’s the only negative point. Rest are perfect for city folks after office hour or business travelers in the area to sweat out and have fun.

Definitely recommend a visit, especially in the evenings when it's cooler. Nature never disappoints, it's usually the few humans in it that do.

We were there at around 10pm - 1030pm one evening. We came across a wide wooden foot bridge across a little pond. We decided to lie down, at the edge of the bridge to enjoy the moonlight.
Only about 7 people passed us whilst we were there for about an hour and a half.
Firstly, we would like to point out that this bridge is more than wide enough for one to two 4-seater golf carts to drive through.

2 staff members drives up in their cart, telling us that we were not allowed to lie down on that bridge. We were completely dumb-founded.
It was near the middle of the night, there was no one about by then, we were not blocking anyone, we were not yelling loudly, we were not fishing, just 2 friends, (fully dressed by the way) lying quietly enjoying the nite. Frankly speaking, we do not see what the problem was. We were not causing any inconvenience to anyone, or any plant at the moment.

For a place that is suppose to offer relaxation and calm, it is far from that in this instance. Very sad that this type of blinkered attutude and lack of discretion as to when to enforce ""Rules and Reguations"" appropriately is not taken into consideration.

But of course, we are in a society that bans the sale of Rum and Raisin ice-cream after 1030pm just because there is an alcohol ban in general. What more can we expect?

Other than that, great garden ~ relax and enjoy if you can but you better check where you can or cannot lie down, whilst you are at it, maybe even check on where you are allowed to stand or sit.",09-2018,Friends,2020-01-26 11:14:46.769483

I think that if you enjoy a relaxing walk and can soak in the atmosphere of the outdoors and nature this is a lovely place to be. I cannot give full stars as I only managed to see half of the gardens but hopefully when I next return I can see the other part! (It was cool when we visited and drizzling and im glad we saw it in that weather)

As I said earlier, i missed out some parts due to lack of time, I believe we got there at 11 and left at 3-3.30 and that gave us time to walk around at least half the garden, stop for a cuppa and some food and head back to a Taxi collection point...we also paid to go and see the Orchid Garden which, in my opinion is worth it, the Botanical Gardens are free to enter.

This is a beautiful Botanical Garden with a variety of plants, water features, arches and other things to see if you enjoy gardens and nature, its a very relaxing space and nice if you fancy a nice stroll to switch off perhaps after some busy shopping!!",06-2018,Friends,2020-01-26 11:15:34.671580

We intended to spend a few hours walking around the gardens, however once we found a nice spot on a sloped hill by the lake (black swans and terrapins!), we ended up just laying down and chilling for a couple of hours. It is a really peaceful and well-kept garden and we couldn't believe we were in the middle of busy cosmopolitan Singapore.

This is a great place to really learn about the different species of plants, flowers, and trees that exits all over Southeast Asia.

I discover new places each time I come here, even though I've lost count on the number of times I've been here.

National Orchid Garden houses the large orchid collection of 1,200 species and 2,000 hybrids. It is at the forefront of orchid studies and a pioneer in the cultivation of hybrids. The VIP Orchid section showcases Singapore's ""orchid diplomacy"" by honouring visiting Heads of States, dignitaries and celebrities, by naming its finest hybrids after them. The national flower of Singapore is a hybrid orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim.
Other important segments are Ginger Garden, Rain Forest and Keppel Discovery Wetlands.
We took two guided tours : Learning Forest Tour and Rain Forest Tour. Each tour lasted for about 90 minutes and involved walking and interacting with friendly guides who were knowledgable and good communicators. No fees were charged except for the entrance to Orchid Garden.
Our visit was very interesting because we saw many old things from a new perspective and learnt by experiencing.
We could see, touch and feel the four layers of the lowland rainforest. Our respect for fig trees increased when we were made aware of their contributions to jungle life. The example of strangler figs revealed their mutualism with fig wasps! We could see many types of bamboo plants and gathered that growth rate of bamboo is the fastest among plants. We could learn that leaves have four broad types of shapes. We came across a large variety of local fruit plants like mangosteen, durian, sea apple, sea coconut. We could watch the differences in barks of different trees like Tembusu and Eucalyptus and closely see the Jelutong tree that yields latex for chewing gums! We learnt that parasite plants generally do not look green. In short, it was a rewarding experience to visit the Botanic Gardens.",04-2018,Friends,2020-01-26 11:16:32.404597

,1,2,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/kienteong,530416909,06-10-2017,5,A most beautiful garden,"This is a very large garden with much to see. The landscape varies as you move from section to section. The main part (which is a very large expanse as-is) is free. A fee applies for the Orchid Garden, but it is worth it. The variety of orchids and the way they are displayed in an almost natural setting is most captivating.

There are several entrances, but I would highly recommend going in via the main entrance at Nassim Gate where the Visitor Centre is. If you are being driven there, tell the driver to go via Cluny Road at the junction with Nassim Road (just in case Nassim Gate doesn't ring a bell).

If you enter via this main entrance, you will have a good starting point for your walk. Upon entering the Garden here, keep to the left trail and walk along Upper Palm Valley Road which will lead you to the Orchid Plaza, the entrance to the Orchid Garden. As mentioned, I highly recommend a visit to the Orchid Garden.

To continue your walk in the open area, keep left at the Orchid Garden and take Maranta Avenue that will lead you to the Bandstand. Explore the various mini gardens around this area to eventually reach Swan Lake. At Swan Lake there are signs to the new Learning Forest section, starting with the Walk of Giants. If you have the time, explore that. Otherwise head towards the Ginger Garden and you will be back at the Orchid Plaza. As a variation, walk along Lower Palm Valley Road to head back to the starting point. If you do take this route, you will have the option to also explore the Evolution Garden, depending on how you do for time, before heading back to the Visitor Centre where you can have a drink or even snack at a cafe there.

Best time to go would be early morning or evening just before 6pm. During certain Saturdays or Sundays each month, there may be music performances on the Stage on Symphony Lake with crowds lazing on Palm Valley. It adds to the overall experience of your visit, so if you can try to go on one of those days.

We'd start out from the current university campus, head to the rear of the gardens first before stepping into the garden grounds and ending our runs at the main gate near Holland/Cluny Roads. At that time, the rear of the gardens (where the Jacobs Ballas Children's Garden is situated) was not part of the Botanic Gardens.

It was never that crowded in the gardens. There was space, serenity and quiet. Occasionally, we'd bump into government ministers and political leaders doing their walks. It was in recent years after the Gardens was recognised by UNESCO as part of the world heritage site that it became more popular with tourists, not just with local and foreign residents. Even an early walk at 6:30am, one will see quite a number of enthusiasts indulging in their stationary and momentary exercises.

I must say that tremendous efforts have been put in to ensure the Gardens is kept and maintained to tip-top condition; perhaps some aspects are overly done. For example, workers are constantly clearing fallen leaves from the walkways. Otherwise, the authorities have constantly introduced diversity and innovative creations to make the gardens comparable to make it comparable to other well-known gardens across the world.

Visitors to Singapore should make an effort to visit the Gardens one of their destinations. The best time to visit is early in the morning when the air is cool and crisp, otherwise the early evening is the next best option. Entry to the Gardens is free to all. Payment is required for visits to the curated orchid garden. There is Botanic Gardens MRT station which is located at the rear of the Gardens.",06-2017,Friends,2020-01-26 11:19:13.374603

The gardens are free to enjoy, except for the National Orchid Garden within the botanic garden itself, which has a 5$S entry fee. We did it, and it was well worth it... some really nice and interesting plants, plus great places for a photo shoot with intricate backgrounds.

There is also a part of the park that has been preserved since the late 1800's, with really unique trees on the verge of extinction... makes you imagine how the whole island must have looked like centuries ago.

It is free to enter and you can spend 2 hours here easily. If you chose to eat lunch here you can make it much longer. Prices at the food places here are higher than elsewhere, but they are in a beautiful setting and the gardens have to make money somehow.

If you do not have time to visit both the Gardens by the Bay and this place I would say visit Gardens by the Bay. However if you want somewhere that is quieter, with fewer tourists (the Gardens by the Bay is not touristy) you should come here. Both places have plenty of local people and more Asian tourists than Western tourists. Both places maintain a feeling of quiet beauty and definitely don't feel like tourist traps (both are free).

The Singapore Botanic Gardens feel like they have grown naturally this way, where the Gardens by the Bay (which are amazing) feel like they have been built by people (and are incredibly well thought out). These gardens (SBG) despite being well maintained feel more 'wild'.

There is a much smaller, very beautiful specialty garden within Singapore Botanic Gardens, if you have a student ID bring it, as you get a significant discount off the ticket to the National Orchid Garden. Students: 1 Singapore Dollar, instead of the normal 5 S Dollars for an adult.

What nature?

Fauna-wise: a rooster. A lizard. A squirrel. Some butterflies and dragonflies. Flora-wise: plenty of tropical plants. Landscaped and taken care of, find some shade and eat your cheese, or get up on the skywalk and capture your next viral snap. A lovely day out either way.

The garden is free to enter and explore every imaginable type of flower and tree. It is so peaceful and beautiful.

There is a small fee to enter The National Orchid Garden, which boasts the world’s largest orchid display, with over 60,000 plants and orchids. These orchids are alive with color and beauty and the pictures that you can take are breathtaking.

Inside the orchid garden there is the “cool house” which tries to recreate the environment of a tropical highland forest and showcases orchids that are normally only found in the tropical highland areas.

Overall, there is more than 10,000 species spread out over its 183 acres of land that we could not possibly see in one day, but we gave it a good try.

While exploring the gardens we came upon a reflexology path. It has stones set up that massage your feet as you walk. It felt so good walking on the path and having our feet massaged from previous days of walking.

There is also a small 15 acre tropical rainforest which is older than the gardens themselves. It was magical walking through this area looking at all the trees that were so aged and had grown to be so majestic.

Fun fact from the research on the internet: More than 80% of its plant species are rare or endangered not only in the Gardens but also in Singapore. Hence it is critical that these species are conserved within one of the last remaining primary forests of Singapore.

I would highly recommend taking a full day to explore the gardens, taking a picnic lunch - although they have a cafe within the gardens - and definitely pay the small fee to enter the orchid area.

Make sure to bring your camera and good walking shoes and be prepared to be awed by the beauty of nature. You will not be disappointed.",01-2017,Friends,2020-01-26 11:21:32.160814

This is a wonderful development of such important Singapore heritage every different corner has a different story that you will want to experience slowly. So do not rush.
The entire garden is broken down into smaller gardens based on themes. The foliage is magnificent as you walk into each garden.
After all the hustle and bustle of the busy city it is nice to have quiet and appreciate all the beauty.
Even the walk to the Botanical Garden is interesting; you get to walk by different country embassies, lots of different architectural apartment buildings.

The garden is made up of several sections - Tanglin, Central and Bukit Timah cores. It is situated a short 10 mins bus ride from Orchard Road (look for buses to Napier Road from Orchard Boulevard side and alight at the bus stop after British Council or ask the bus driver to alert you). You start off from the main gates along Napier and if you walked along the main pathway, you will soon reach the Swan Lake, a nice oasis away from the hustle and bustle of concrete Orchard Road. A popular spot for tourists is the National Orchid Garden (Central core zone) which boasts over 1000 species of orchids, which is the national flower of Singapore. The park is actually free but you will need to pay a nominal entrance fee of $5 for adults, $1 for senior citizens above 60 years and it's free for kids under 12 years. The park has regular concerts and events throughout the year. Suggest that you check out the Singapore botanic gardens website for more info.

The Orchid Garden is closeby where you can pay a reasonable entrance fee to explore the many varieties of orchids.

The national orchid garden is within the park and is a riot of color. The garden is free, except for the orchid garden.

Overall, the Botanic Gardens is a great place to picnic. The acoustics were pretty good considering the outdoor environment and the picturesque view, soothing. We hung around for a few hours afterwards to chit-chat and enjoy the night sky and fresh air.

The only down side is that the MRT drops off at about 600 M from the visitor center and therefor you do not have a map of the gardens until you walk to the visitor center, but the are in the process of building a new visitor center near the MRT.

An the sound of falling dripping water at the main entrance which I always feel that it's a form of water therapy, peacefully calmed the mind.

Placed my dog in my bag wanted to use the washroom but there was this Chinese old cleaner demanded me to leave her outside before entering. How very rude of him.

With its slopes , theme gardens ( Healing,
Fossil, Orchid etc) , lakes etc you can spend a few hours here without getting bored. Not to mention the abundant energy
you witness as the local residents run, do Tai Chi , Yoga , walk some cutest dogs etc.
Actually it is the only such place I have visited where the locals out number the tourists esp on a Sunday morn!
More importantly there are reminders aplenty that it is an old heritage park - old
huge trees , some with roots really spreading out few metres , some touching the sky.

You can't miss the ORCHID GARDENS. Singapore's national flower is the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid. And these gardens are absolutely lovely.

When we went they had a promotion and the entire orchid garden was free.

The rest of the park was quite nice as well. It's less floral and more trees and plants. I would say it takes about 2-3 hours to walk through the entire park. Most people just come here to sit and relax on the many benches and the grass.",11-2015,Friends,2020-01-26 11:25:51.274694

Each day before the break of dawn, young and old flock to the sprawling gardens to jog, meditate, exercise or simply to enjoy the freshness of the morning mist. Slow moving silhouettes of Tai Chi and Qigong practitioners can be seen in exclusive nooks and corners of the gardens. As walkers pass each other, a simple nod of the head or a smiling whisper of ""good morning"" serves create a great atmosphere and a good start to the day.

The Botanic garden serves as an oasis and a refuge throughout the day. Entry is free and there are pockets of amenities such as food courts, rustic restaurants and kiosks which are subtle and does not overly commercialise the place. It takes perhaps 2-3 hours to explore the various features of the gardens in a leisurely pace. The gardens are very well featured and maintained but manage to retain its natural charm and authenticity.

Bring your sandwich lunch in and find your favourite corner to chill out for an hour or so. Do not forget your camera! Lots of photo opportunities. It is a favourite wedding photo site for the locals. You will find yourself being drawn back to the gardens every day!
