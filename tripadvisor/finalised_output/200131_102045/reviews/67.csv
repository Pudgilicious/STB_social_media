My father in law was in the RAF during World War 2 and was captured by the Japanese and sent to Changi. He took part in the building of the infamous Burma Railway and suffered greatly at the hands of his captors. He survived and actually lived until he was over 90. He was a brave man and spoke little of the traumas he experienced, but he saw dozens of his comrades succumb to malnutrition, sickness and the inhuman treatment meted out to these young men. He, himself, suffered from innumerable bouts of malaria, including the very dangerous cerebral form, and was saved by the dropping of antibiotics by the American forces as they liberated the various camps in the jungle.

He was a survivor and we are so proud of the way he adapted to his brutal imprisonment.

So it had always been a dream of mine to visit the museum with my husband, his son.

We found the visit very moving, so much so that we were in tears in places. We had no idea of the variety of people who were imprisoned and tortured. It’s fascinating to see the artefacts, especially the amazing patchwork made by the women in prison, with hidden meanings.

The museum itself is in poor condition, and these wonderful artefacts are not displayed to their best advantage. It’s worrying to see them so unprotected and poorly displayed.
But the story these artefacts tell is amazing. Such bravery, such heartbreak, but such stories of great humanity - despite all the fear and the terrible conditions people supported each other, and shared their meagre rations, and performed in concerts, and tried to keep spirits up.

The chapel is very moving. We lit a candle for him and my husband left a message. Our 4 children flew out to join us for this moving pilgrimage.

We are pleased to hear the museum is being refurbished and we hope to be able to visit it again before too long.",01-2018,Family,2020-01-31 10:28:19.841955

It does explains quietly and succinctly what happened when the Japanese forces took over Singapore after the British surrender. It doesn't dwell on the horrific, although it leaves no doubt about the suffering of those affected, rather it celebrates the triumphs of humanity especially through the places of worship created by the POW's. The Changi murials reproduced here, and their story, are very moving.

We should have just caught a taxi in the first place as it was only about SD$6. We enjoyed the museum, being Australians and hearing some of the stories about the hardships endured during WWII.

The museum is free to enter and whilst it’s small not on the same scale as Hiroshima or Pearl Harbour, it certainly provides an emotional insight into what the prisoners went through. It was more personal to me as this is part of Australia’s history and seeing the horrendous inhumanities that the Australians, Kiwis, British and the Singaporeans were subjected to brought tears to my eyes.

We found the easiest way to get there was to catch the MRT to the airport and then catch a taxi from there but the driver explained on the way back that we should have incurred a flat $50 fee for being dropped back at the departure area to catch the MRT back so that may be something to consider ( He didn't charge us this on the day).

It was interesting just watching him move at his own speed.. He (15) is not normally big on reading museum information boxes, he just tends to move at a fairly rapid pace through museums, stopping at whatever catches his eye however he read pretty much every display box and was quite quiet and reserved afterwards. I could tell he was just processing it and needed time to take it all in, even though he did have a basic understanding of the story before going . The Individual tales moved him.

This is a must see for anyone interested in war history and certainly for any Australians because of the strong link to our war story. Its a bit tricky to get out there so we took a taxi to get there and then bus and metro home.",10-2017,Family,2020-01-31 10:28:32.489748

It is small but perfectly formed however, and evokes extremely well the harrowing capture, appalling treatment of, and incredible endurance and innovation of those captured in Singapore and held and Changi and in other Japanese camps. The audio tour is a vital addition, and does direct you to key exhibits - but it leaves plenty of time to read and look at the displays. There is far more to see than is covered on the audio tour, which has about 19 stations.
I've been on two occasions, three years apart, and apart from a reconfigured entrance desk, there did not seem to be much development of the museum. The story of the fall of Singapore stands by itself, of course, and this museum is focused very much on the human story - human suffering, human cruelty, but above all the triumph of the human spirit. The creativity and inventiveness of the captured soldiers is amazing; the compassion shown to them by others who helped, the extraordinary bravery and endurance of the prisoners - all are remarkable. But having said that, the stories - and the collection of artefacts - could perhaps be brought to life more vividly, by exploiting some of the innovations in museums and curatorship that now exist.
The shop is a missed opportunity, for example, and should contain far more educative material, for people who want to read, or learn more about the experiences of Changi. There is a small research area, but on both occasions I have visited it has had no use.",06-2017,Family,2020-01-31 10:28:41.815975

It's only a small museum, but it is quite emotional. Spend half an hour in the Chapel - meditating, praying, relaxing or simply thinking about what you should be doing with your life.
It's not a modern museum - so no ""sight and sound"" displays, no smells(!) - but there is lots to see but it will require you to read things. You should, it is worth it and makes your realise the pain that wars cause. Some of the displays are excellent.
You could spend 15 minutes here or 4 hours, if you were to read everything.

I would not recommend it for younger children, as they could find it disturbing.

The audio tour is a must as the experience of ex-POWs brings the whole museum to life and makes the experience much more personal and very moving.

I interviewed my Nana's neighbour a couple of decades ago, who was a Australian POW at the Changi prison who worked on the railway.

So this history has always been of interest.

I am unsure what i was expecting and for some reason may have expected more after reading up on the Changi prison and the Japanese exploits during the war.

The Museum is informative and worth a visit.

There is an area in the mock up chapel to light a candle in memory of loved ones and relatives who may have served or been a POW. So I paid tribute to Mr Gordon A Sutton QX14137 who helped me as a young teenager answer the questions I had about being a POW. A sense of closure and to remember him for his service and sacrifice.

Photos cannot be taken inside - I would have perhaps thought that the opportunity to take photos should be afforded given persons travel from afar to pay their respects. Whilst appreciating people visit to reflect and pause on the exploits of war and humanity, an opportunity to take some pics would have been appreciated.

There are also audio tours available for a charge to walk through the small Museum.

Need an hour at least to peruse the information boards etc on offer.

We visited via local tourism tours that can be booked. I perhaps was a little disappointed at the pricing and what was on offer at the museum.

In saying that, if you're interested in the WWII history and that of the Changi prison, then it's definitely worth a visit.

His brother in law died in a battle in Malaya. I don’t know, who of the two were better off. The family at home did not have the luxury of the instant communications we enjoy today, so it was years before they knew anything.
On the subject of luxury, we enjoyed an air-conditioned tour and comfortable amenities. I felt humbled and sad, almost hypocritical.
We were enthusiastically greeted at the door by Catherine who is passionate about her tours. To be honest it was hard to absorb it all, and on another visit to Singapore I would most definitely have a return visit, if nothing else, to pay my respects.
This museum shows visitors the horror, the injustice and man’s cruelty to man. The story is starkly told. Catherine told us as much as she could in a one hour tour and told us that she could talk about this subject all day. Indeed her narrative often brought tears to my eyes and then she would slip in a little bit of ironic humor and I could just take a deep breath and move along to the next display.

Australian's like many others from Commonwealth countries made huge sacrifices in Singapore during WWII.

Aussies are mentioned several times throughout the Story of the Fall of Singapore during WWII and the subsequent occupation by the Japanese as documented at The Changi Museum.

There is a nominal charge to rent a headset to enhance your visit by listening to a number of audio presentations in addition to the material displayed on the walls throughout the premises.

Some audio stories are pretty harrowing so parents should consider screening first before allowing young kids to listen in.

The stories are very moving, highly emotional, and you cant help but feel sombre & solemn given the pain experienced by all in Singapore during these dark times.

A visit to the Museum itself is free...but I would recommend the audio as extra.

Its a good idea to bring along something to keep very young kids entertained...we took a media device which kept our 6yr old occupied throughout our visit...no disruption to other visitors or disrespect shown to the Museum.

He laments the lack of content re the defense of Singapore. My father was a prisoner in Changi and was a soldier in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders which, I understand, was the last regiment to fight it's way down the Peninsula and across the causeway, and I therefore have some sympathy with that reviewer's view. There was only one mention of the Argylls that I could see in the entire museum (other than the long, long list of their dead in the summary books just inside the exit), so I would also have liked to see more about the military campaign related to the defense of Singapore - but I suspect that would be an entirely different museum. This museum is about the Camp and about life for the locals under Japanese occupation and assessed against that objective it is a success. While it is very low tech (but do get the audioguide which is definitely worthwhile), its thematic approach works quite well. There are relatively few physical artifacts but they are well used to highlight key areas such as health, food, how the prisoners entertained themselves and the like. I did think it was a little odd that no photographs were allowed given there were no copyright issues, but perhaps the curator thinks this is a mark of respect and he might be right. At the end of the day it's a fairly grim little museum, even for those with no family involvement. For me it brought home how much my generation owes to my father and his generation and how lucky we are that we haven't had to go through anything similar.

On a practical note don't let your hotel suggest hiring a car and driver (and certainly don't bother with the MRT).

We asked our taxi driver to take us as near to the old area as possible and he did so going right around the perimeter fence where you can also see the tops of the old gates from the rear of the new prison. Take a zoom lense with you for better pictures.
We then went into the museum which is full of facts and memorabilia from that period. You can also take a headset tour.
Being of such interest we we're there for ages reading all the information and looking at the books at the end. We learnt a lot about my father's incarceration which he would NEVER talk about.

Despite having visited Singapore a couple of times, I'd never quite had the chance to get out this far and see the museum.
My wife and I were able to join a bus tour operated by Singapore Walks, which is highly recommended as it put things into the appropriate context. The museum itself is quite small, but contains more than its fair share of important stories and reminders about this particularly dark time.

Other reviews have commented on the fact that a number of things (including the famous frescoes and the Chapel itself) are reproductions. A lot of this is due to souvenir-hunting - by my home country, in the case of the Chapel! - and the fact that Changi Prison itself is still a working maximum-security prison to this day, and that expansion of that structure has meant that some of the site has been taken over by the prison. To expect the staff of a maximum-security prison to let tourists traipse through and take photos is just silly, and frankly I was surprised when our guide told us that this had been the case during the 1980s.

As well as containing a lot of information about man's inhumanity to man, the museum also has some genuinely moving stories about the human spirit. The background to the photo of the smiling POW is startling, as are the stories behind the ""Two malarias and a cholera"" sketch and the frescoes. Additionally, it does a good job of debunking the ""guns were aiming in the wrong direction"" myth - the defences of Singapore weren't solely aimed at the Straits by any means, although their utility for an inland invasion was limited.

This is a sad place, most assuredly, and the recommendation from our guide that ""a dinner with alcohol"" would be a good antidote to the stories was well-received, but the history of the last century isn't just about sweetness and light by any means.",06-2017,Couples,2020-01-31 10:31:52.374168

I'm sure the volunteers who run it do so with the best intentions but really there's just not enough of the real Changi to make this a 'must visit' location.

It's a shame the museum feels hidden away from the tourist places as it truly provides an account of what happened and the atrocities that took place.

All the stories & accounts I read about were moving. But the most moving was that of the women and children that suffered.

My heart was warmed by the stories of how they helped each other, used their faith to keep going . I was also encouraged at the ingenuity that pows showed amazing.

We met a taxi driver who was very pleasant and we asked why it seemed not many people acknowledged this. He said we wish to look forward. I think that that is a positive way to look at life .

Even though the original chapel was dismantled and dispatched to Australia, there is a replica chapel that was built in 1988. There are many paintings, letters, drawings and photographs that depict the pain and torment of the prisoners. One of its most poignant displays is the ‘Changi Murals’ that include a series of paintings based on Biblical themes by Stanley Warren, a British airman. These murals were finished using limited materials such as camouflage paint, crushed snooker chalk and aircraft paints. There is also a Brass Cross made of spent ammunition casings, from soldiers' guns. Most of the museum’s exhibits were donated by former prisoners of war and their families.

He was imprisoned at Changi before being sent to Thailand to spend three years laboring on the construction of the death railway. He survived the war but it had such a traumatic effect that he was never able to talk much about it. In the little bits I gleaned, however, the horror of it came through and i have since learnt much more through reading and visiting sites like this. What took place was truly horrific and although the topic is not pleasant, it is nevertheless highly interesting to hear the stories and see how people could survive, although many, of course, did not. As a starter the sheer numbers tell there own story with 15000 prisoners being forced into a prison that was built for 3,400.

As time goes by it is important that people, especially the youth of today, do not forget what happened here so that they can ensure that it never happens again.

The war memorial was as many have already witnessed in other countries, a reminder of the numbers of people who died, were mal-treated and the actual account of how Singapore fell to the Japanese.
If this historical episode interests you, you would be better getting public transport/taxi so that the time spent would be at your desire and not artificially controlled. Remember that the cost varies according to taxi colour and in ascending order the cheapest is blue/yellow, then maroon and lastly grey, with limos the highest. The underground is very clean, signs in English and very cheap.
The museum itself is well laid out and contains interesting facts clearly displayed on boards throughout, quotes from residents and soldiers and an opportunity to purchase books associated with the occupation of Singapore.

I don't think that it's promoted or as funded as it should be, for an important historical location. Such a shame. Probably would be even more interesting if some of the original prison was still there",06-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 10:34:13.077478

Entry is free but we elected to purchase an audio tour for S$12.

There is a chapel as part of the museum and a small shop. There are lots of photos and interesting artifacts. Look out for the quilt made by female Pows and sent to the men's camp and which contains coded messages. There is a cafe adjacent to the museum.

,1,67,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Ransome C,377493134,29-05-2016,5,Little museum that punches above its weight,"The unassuming entrance facade of the Changi Museum might mislead visitors to only assume that there is just a replica of the St. Luke's Chapel and nothing else to see. Not so, step into what you see as a small air-conditioned room - I thought it was a tiny museum shop cum library, and wander into long annexes of exhibits, showcases, installations- all beautifully categorized and collated.

During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore during World War 2, the Changi Royal Air Force (RAF) base, Roberts Barracks Block 151 at Changi Military Base was turned into a make-shift hospital for prisoners-of-war of the Allied Forces. As disease and malnutrition was rife among the captives, the Christian chaplains ministering to the sick obtained permission from the Japanese commander to convert part of the ground floor of the hospital's ""Dysentery Wing"" (Blk. 151) into a chapel as a source of comfort and solace.

Known as St. Luke's Chapel, the chapel opened on 12 July 1942 for patients, and in particular, for the staff of 196, 197 and 198 Field Ambulances R.A.M.C.. Daily service was held with the distribution of Holy Communion. Of note were the altar rail, which was designed by an officer of the 18th Division, and built by the 18th Division Royal Engineers. The chapel's font was made by Captain Cook, 5th Suffolk Regiment.

It is also here that you can see the famous Changi Murals - a set of five biblical theme paintings - painted by Stanley Warren, a British bombardier and prisoner-of-war (POW) interned at the Changi Prison, during the Japanese occupation of Singapore in World War II. Completed under difficult conditions of sickness, limited materials and hardships and with a message of universal love and forgiveness, they helped to uplift the spirits of the POWs and sick when they sought refuge in the prison chapel.

The Chapel furnishings were moved to Selarang Barracks on 27 August 1943 and the areas closed in. The building and chapel were subsequently used by the Japanese Air Force as a storeroom. After the war, the walls of the chapel were distempered over, hiding the murals from view. They were forgotten until its rediscovery in 1958.

Due to their historical significance, an international search was conducted to locate the original painter in helping to restore the damaged and faded murals. Stanley was eventually found in 1959 and, after much persuasion, agreed to assist in the restoration project. Three trips - spanning a period of more than 20 years -to Singapore between 1963 to 1988 were made to restore his former paintings. Due to Stanley's advanced age, only four of the original murals were fully restored.

In 1988, Singapore built a replica Chapel and Museum next to the Changi Prison. When Changi Prison was expanded in 2001, the Chapel and Museum was relocated to a new site 1 km away and the Changi Chapel and Museum was officially established on 15 February 2001. Bernard Stogden, the son of Sgt. Harry Stogden, was invited to place the cross that his father made onto the wreathed altar in the new Chapel. He was claimed to have cried while doing so, as this was one of the only chances he got to interact with his father (through his work) as ""Harry"" Stogden died during the war.

The Museum has a fine collection of paintings, photographs and personal effects donated by former POWs. Among the collection is a series of paintings and sketches by a POW named William Haxworth which provide valuable insight on the daily life of the internees during the occupation. In 1986, Haxworth's wife donated a collection of over 400 paintings and sketches to the National Archives of Singapore.

Also in the museum is a collection of watercolour paintings by Mary Angela Bateman who was among the thousands of women and children held at Changi Prison for more than three years during the war.",05-2016,Couples,2020-01-31 10:34:20.889786

Getting to the museum via public transport is cheap and easy. Take the MRT to Tanah Merah then the number 2 bus to the museum. When exiting the station, at the bottom of the stairs is a sign that says go left for the number 2 bus. Ignore the sign and go right. The number 2 bus stops just outside the station.

Easily read and understood exhibits - detailing the harsh extremes that the soldiers were subjected to.

It is disappointing that the museum as such is a purpose built stand alone building, with only a small portion of concrete wall of the original prison on display.

For some reason the Singaporean Government decided post - war to continue using a lot of the original prison building as a present day gaol. So it is difficult to get an appreciation of the actual conditions.

Having been fortunate enough to have visited Dachau, Auschwitz/Birkenhau and Mauthausen over the years - where you can see and feel the evil of the experiences suffered by inmates. It is unfortunate that at least some of the original Changi buildings have not been preserved.

I was on my way to join my wife and family in New Zealand.I stopped-over in Singapore to catch up with Chinese friends, that I haven't seen in 30 years. I chose to stay in the Village Hotel in Changi providing a perfect base to explore this fascinating island,and on the first bus ride to Tampines Central, we passed the site of this museum. The very next day, before taking the MRT to Harbourside, I alighted and spent an emotional hour here. My uncle, Charles Edward Macklin, was captured at the fall of Singapore on the 15th February 1942, almost as soon as he had set up a defensive barrier across the Bukit Timah, the main road leading from the Johor Burhu crossing into the heart of the Lion City. He was incarcerated with many of the 50 thousands of others, and as a Army officer, a former middle-weight boxing champion in the services, and a secondee to the Indian Army, he received special treatment by the Japanese occupiers. Needless to say, I was deeply moved by the countless personal stories, the many artefacts, and in particular the replica of St.Luke's chapel, patron saint of hopeless cases., on the ground floor of the former Roberts Barracks, which brought some comfort to the prisoners in the Changi complex. It was deeply moving to view the Warren murals, based on the four New Testament Gospels, especially the Nativity with its depiction of the multi-racial 3 wise kings, and the words

I think it is important we know and do not forget yet at the same time in reality it can be very hard to take in and place yourself in the shoes of those who suffered. So I could not stay long or take everything in.
I took a taxi there from Changi Village having been assured a taxi back would be easy to find. It wasn't. The nearby road is solely residential and with the prison nearby it is not exactly taxi cruising central. The museum Visitor staff were incredibly kind and called a taxi for me after I had waited around on the off chance for one for some time, but of course you then have to pay a booking fee.

Since we have a large group of residents, I sent in a notification of visit to the museum for approval and it was approved without much query.

At any one time, the museum can only accommodate 120 persons including walk-ins and groups and reserves the right to reject any visitor who come unannounced. The approval on the notification of visit is just an acknowledgement and does not mean that a guided tour is provided for the visit. Although admission is free, guided tour is charged.

We arrived at the museum at about 9.10 am but the entrance was locked as it only opens at 9.30 am. We waited patiently in the bus as the weather was extremely hot on that day. There were also few foreign visitors waiting outside the gate and by the time it opened at 9.30 am, we swarmed into the air-conditioned exhibition hall like school children going into the classroom.

This is the second time I visited the museum. It has not changed much since the last time I visited few years ago. Many of my residents were Mandarin speaking and I did my best to translate into Mandarin of what was on the exhibition panels. Most felt disgusted by the horrible sight of decapitated heads and starved skeletal bodies of the Prisoners of War.

Few of the `old aunties' residents who had suffered miserably during the Japanese invasion recalled the terrible massacre of the innocents and living in fear and phobia throughout the 3 years and 8 months of Japanese tyrannical rule.

Millions of precious lives perished during the Second World War. In my opinion, it was a war between the imperialist titans to capture and plunder the resources of the lands they lay their hands on.

The Allied Powers represented the western colonial powers who had stretched their claws into Asia much more earlier than the Japanese. The White Rajah were in Borneo; the Spaniards in Philippines, the French in Indo-China, the Dutch in Batavia and the Portuguese in Melaka.

The Meiji Restoration changed Japan into a technological advanced powerful nation who can challenged the Western imperialists and when both titans fight for resources, the impoverished and innocent people of the lands they plundered became the scapegoat and victims of the war.

Singapore is one of those lands exploited by the British East Indies Company as a port for trade to the Far East. The Fall of Singapore was from the clutch of one British imperialists to the tyrannical Japanese imperialists. Both the British and the Japanese were here to serve their own interests. Not only the locals suffered but the faithful and loyal servants of the British Colonial armed forces also suffered miserably during the wars. Many of them perished when they were sent to Burma to build the deadly railway.

The Second World War woke up the minds of those `stupid' people who lived on lands exploited by the colonialists and imperialists. The rise of nationalism open the eyes of those innocent people who were treated like servants by their colonial masters.

This was not value for money. Even though the Tour Guide advised us that she had been doing this for the past 16 years I was disappointed that she did not tailor the tour towards Australians as 98% of the tour participants were Australian with two Americans. It would have been better to just get ourselves to the museum and walk around the venue to read and look at the pictures. My Aunty who I attended with was connected to the history of the museum as her father was an Australian who was incarcerated in Changi for 3.5 years. This was supposed to be a moving experience for her to undertake, but the experience was not as we expected it to be.

Having the tour guide drone on for ages almost reciting word for word what was on show was a bit boring. As well as handing out laminated pictures. A suggestion would be for the buses to have a TV in them and provide an interesting slide show or short movie while you are on the bus. It is a very interesting place and in reality the tour guide should have given us background information that is not included in the museum. I was also surprised at how small the museum was.

Lee Kuan Yew had scathing words to say of the British in this respect in his biography. The tales of hardship are evident from quotes and artifacts in the museum. The internees were varied and diverse. They endured hardship at the hands of the Japanese and tales of the period make sad recollection.

Then came two bombs - the Emperor didn't understand the first - when Hiroshima and Nagasaki had both been flattened it brought about a sense of reality and with it a surrender. Likewise Singapore returned to its old colonial masters - and Singapore was free again.

Exhibits are tangible memories of the disaster that was the fall of Singapore in 1942.

Visit will leave you emotionally drained as it documents in detail the excesses and brutality of the Japanese occupation especially the inhuman and cruel treatment of prisoners of war. Should be compulsory for all Japanese students but the whole pacific war is whitewashed in their school system. Pity.

Even though the space is small, taking in all the museum will take about 1.5 hours at least. I'm a History major and teach it at the Community College level. I also specialised in East Asian and Military history at university. This museum is small but it has quality and can be spoken of in the same breath as the Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas, USA, though it can't match it in sheer scale. Documents very well the British experience in the Far East and showcases their failings.

I make an annual visit with some of my students around Remembrance Day (the American equivalent of Memorial Day) and we also visit the Kranji War memorial.

The Changi Museum tells the plight of brave men enduring brutal captors and how every day counted in taking care of your mates to survive the internment.

As an Australian, this is one of the key places to visit in its Military history.

I had been here in the 90s and it was great introducing some young friends to the story on this visit.

If you're an Australian staying in Singapore make it a point to visit the Museum. You will only need around an hour.

Among the collection is a series of paintings and sketches by a POW which provide valuable insight on the daily life of the internees during the occupation.

Appreciate their sense of humour despite the deplorable conditions. Emerge richer for the experience.

Visitors from western countries will appreciate the place dedicated to their war dead. But I think Japanese visitors will find this place a shock to their system because this part of history is not taught in their schools. Regardless, it is an important place to visit, to learn and feel.

The ride out there on public transport was easily managed and pretty much drops you outside the entrance. I believe it was bus route 2.
The prison & chapel museum is immaculately maintained and well worth spending the few dollars on the audio tour - this is not mandatory but certainly adds to the experience. We spent more than one hour there and could easily have spent more than two.
Although the tour is suitable for families it is advisable for parents to accompany their children throughout as some of the images are confronting - images of executions and civilian victims of bomb damage etc. The images are necessary to convey the depth of brutality that was visited upon the population and POWs.
I certainly came away with a much greater appreciation of the Battle, its aftermath and the tribulations suffered by many.
It was particularly noteworthy that all visitors seemed to treat the site with the respect it deserved, maintaining a respectful volume in conversation and treating the artifacts appropriately.
