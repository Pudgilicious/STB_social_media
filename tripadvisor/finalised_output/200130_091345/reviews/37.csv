Went with a baby and a toddler. My toddler was too young to question some of the more unusual statues but it's possible an older toddler may do/ potentially be a bit scared (my toddler just didn't like the buddha statues). We avoided the counts of hell section though.
Nice stroll through the park. Couldn't access all of it with the stroller but still felt it was worth the visit. My toddler loved feeding the Terrapins (we stopped at the first one but discovered there were loads more). Visitor centre/ food very limited so eat before/ after! Snacks/ drinks/ ice cream available.

Those with an understanding of Chinese folk stories will get more out of it. Not hugely recommended for younger kids (our 6 y.o. was fairly bored and only really enjoyed feeding the terrapins).

- right next to the MRT station so fairly convenient
- there are some juice vending machines outside but not much to get by way of food
- bring a few $1 coins to buy food for the terrapins - these are scattered throughout the park
- you can probably see most of the park in 1-1.5 hours. Don’t plan on spending a whole day here.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 09:25:33.175849

My children loved seeing all the colourful statues and feeding the Terrapins and fish. But I still dont fully understand many of the statues. Lol.

Initally, the kids were not aware of the place but when we reached there. They were v excited. My girl is learning about monkey god and she is super excited about the Monkey God section. Her teacher had also told them about the 10 courts of hell and she is also v excited when she visited it. My younger girl (aged 7) was a little scared when she was inside but I think it is a good learning for the kids.

We have also bought the turtle feeds for them to feed the turtle. However, it is a Honesty box approach. No one monitor the payment. Good learning values.

Overall, it is very good visit. Recommeded for all to visit.

It also educate us especially the kids to do more good deeds and help people and respect the elderly. I personally like it but my kids which are 7 yrs and 10 yrs old scare and even cried when inside the 10 courts of hell. The place is not advisable if it's raining as places not shelter. The visiting hours are 9am to 7pm but the 10 courts of hell close at 6pm.

It's free admission and easily accessible via MRT. Alight at Haw Par Villa Station CC25 (Circle Line) and It's just a minute walk from the entrance to the park.

Very unusual and quirky and we seem to see something different every time we go. The nature of some of the statues are very different from the usually reserved Singapore. It has recently had a fresh lick of paint and looks great.

Avoid in heavy rain - the ground surface is very slippery when wet and expect to have a good hike up the hill as you wander through the attraction.

Very conveniently located right at the entrance to Haw Par Villa MRT station.

Remember to take $1 to feed the terrapins at the pond at the top.",04-2019,Family,2020-01-30 09:25:42.397554

This said attraction has no entrance fee. It is free for everyone who wants to see the famous Tiger Balm, and other statues/displays it can offer.

Base on our experienced, it was enjoyable (even though its raining) especially if you are a fan or lover of history, artifacts, and other things that radiates the culture of one country. Also, it had an exhibition the day we paid a visit: Ten Courts or Counts of Hell (as I can fully recall).

Recommendation: I don't recommend this as a family activity especially with children ages 10 and below since they will easily get bored, and tired (for long walks).",04-2018,Family,2020-01-30 09:25:43.559550

It was cool and breezy. We had an amazing tour guide Nancy who was so passionate about her job and she made the entire tour such a memorable one. Our favourite part of the tour was learning about the interesting back story of the Boon brothers who opened this park and the sad tragedies of their lives that inspired them to contemplate on the intricacies of life and death. Seeing the different religions converge was pretty interesting as well!!

We had always wanted to bring our 11 year-old twins to visit the place where mummy and daddy had fun when we were young! Our guide for the Tiger Balm Garden Story was Carol Dragon. She is so experienced and informative. She is engaging and caring as she constantly reminded us the slippery floor due to the earlier downpour. The passionate Carol deserves another Tour Guide of the Year Award! Keep up the Good Job!
I like the Jade Room where the Haw Par brothers story was told. The Virtues and Vices were good reminders.

Very colourful old Chinese characters are dotted around the entrance. We went straight to the courts of hell tunnel which is interesting. There are descriptions of each court of hell and what the sins are and the punishments for the sins with little scenes to go with them in case you couldn’t visualise being sawn in half or thrown into a hill of knives. While that section is quite morbid, the rest of the park is full of weird but wonderful statues of gods and emperors and weird crab and merpeople.

If you like kitsch, Buddhism, or just seeing things that don't exist elsewhere, this is a must-visit for your time in Singapore. I live in Japan, where theme parks and kitsch reign supreme, and I've never seen anything on this scale. It is a fascinating walk through Buddhist Hell and other teachings that give moral guidance, so it is informative as well! PLUS it is free of charge and no one really goes, so it's largely empty.

I really enjoyed the death museum they’re trying to establish and look forward to seeing that grow over coming years.

The rest of the grounds were amazing, colourful and interesting. Some more shady and seating areas would be helpful.

The history of Haw Par Villa was the most interesting part of the visit. We wouldn’t have learnt anything about this if we hadn’t popped into the little shop.

The themes may seem morbid with lots of “deaths by various ways” on display but this park was built during the time when humility, filial piety, hardwork, loyalty and many other traditional virtues were held in high esteem and a failure to be virtuous was “shamable and punishable”. The owners Haw Brothers sought to emphasize on these teachings by showing scenes from various Chinese mythologies. The real highlight is the 10 levels of hell and the punishments for “crimes” like being disrespectful to parents and siblings. It was an eye opener to my kids aged 8 and 10 and reminiscent to recall childhood stories told by my gran.

There was a young girl working there in the gift shop who advised a new company was looking to open it up again but not sure when, such a shame to see it like that.

My Grandfather who was stationed with the Royal Navy out in Singapore in the 50's or 60's and used to talk about this place. Then it seemed to fall out of favour and tourists were warned off going there. Well now it's back! but still a work in progress.
It has it's own MRT station (Haw Par) and is easy to get to. There are spots set aside for catering outlets and shops but so far none are taken so you can't get any food inside apart from an ice-cream or cold drink at the very small visitor centre.
It's not a Garden even though that's what it's commonly known as. It a park full off garish, crazy statues telling Chinese myths and stories. It's fun, kitsch, surprising and startling. The statues are being repainted and restored, obviously after many years of neglect, so some are bright and shiny while others are faded and cracked.
There is a covered separate area which houses the 10 Courts of Hell tableau's, which are gruesome models of crime and punishment according to Chinese myths. The models are so kitsch that most children have probably seen worse on the internet but it's worth being cautious with sensitive children.

It's certainly free now and the best bit is the MRT drops you off right at the gardens.
It looks very tired from the last time I saw it and neglected. However the plus side is there is a lot of upgrading going on so I would think it will be beautiful in a strange grotesque way again.
We had our boys with us- 7&14 both were slightly freaked by the 10 gates to hell.

Near the entrance you can see the 18 gates of hell where figurines of male and female were tortured in hell for the wicked lives they had led. There is a lake which contains lotus flowers and tortoises. The park is set on a hillside and you can see statues of sumo wrestlers and also the Chinese hero of the Opium War Lin Ze Xu who wrote to Queen Victoria to stop the export of opium to China.

Kind of like a theme park, it's a collection of painted statutes and scenes bringing ancient legends to life.

The best part is the 10 Chambers of Hell which illustrates the horrible, limb-tearing, blood-splattering, skull-maiming fate that awaits bad people in Hell. But don't worry! After your sentence is carried out (be it in boiling oil, getting torn limb from limb, getting your heart cut out, etc etc), you get to be reborn and try again!

The scenes were pretty unfamiliar to me, so I didn't get as much out of it as someone who grew up with this stuff, but I recognized the Monkey King, Pigsy, and a few others.

Yes, it does look slightly worn down but given this park was around since the 1937, the hot weather in Singapore, I would say it is in pretty good nick.

Also, bring a parasol.","Not perhaps the very highest-priority tourist attraction in Singapore, but I'd always meant to try to get out here. So glad we were able to take a tour with Hemlata of Original Singapore Walks, because there is a lot to understand about Chinese mythology and philosophy, as well as the Tiger Balm brothers' history, and it's not all laid out in the signs. Not by a long shot.

This is a quirky place. The Aw brothers put it together quirkily and the successive curators of the site have made quirky choices about what they saved and rearranged. So, you can see a replica Tiger Balm promotional car, a random assortment of stereotypical tourist icons from other countries and a cross-section of large dioramas and colourful sculptures drawn from Chinese myths...

... and of course the famous circles of hell. They warn now against bringing sensitive young children in there. Hemlata's grandmother used to bring her grandkids there regularly. ""Yes, we've pondered that statue of the cheating student being disembowelled, Grandma, can we go get our ice cream now?""

If you don't leave with a deep respect for Asian family values, a higher appreciation of the sculptors' sense of humour and a much improved understanding of the many uses of concrete, you haven't been paying attention. You might leave with sunstroke, though, if you don't bring a parasol. Shade is scarce and there's only so long you can take refuge in the darkened circles of hell. Good thing there are vending machines, $2 for lemon water worth every penny.

His aim was to “share the moral values behind the various meaningful Chinese legends” (Haw Par Villa signage) through sculptures depicting scenes and stories throughout the gardens.

The gardens were opened in 1937. They are built on the side of a hill, which is not too onerous, unless mobility is an issue. The figurines are varied and colourful. Quite different to what one normally sees. The Ten Courts of Hell are a bit gruesome. Have a quick look before taking a young child through. This is just one small section of the garden. It looked like more sculptures were being added - but a bit out of character I thought. You will find kangaroos and koala bears near some gorillas at the top of the hill. The view would have been something when first built.

The gardens are readily accessible by rail and entry is free. The rail stop (Haw Par Villa MRT) is four stops from the Harbour Front MRT rail station. Look for the correct exit. The villa is right beside it. It is well located for those on a cruise ship with a couple of hours to spare waiting to embark or to fly out later in the day.

All that remains is the theme park created by the Aw brothers (inventors of Tiger Balm) which was begun in the 1930s and extended in the 1950s.

But then this park is all about the bizarre - and the odd, the kitsch, and the grotesque. If you like Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights, or are thrilled by horror stories, you will love this display of a thousand figures - give or take a few - created to illustrate tales from Chinese mythology, or as dire warnings of what can happen when Lessons Aren't Learned!

I really enjoyed walking round this place examining all the strange tableaux, many of which seemed totally inexplicable, although some had a wistful retro charm in their depiction of figures from decades ago. It's a real contrast to some of the glitzy, high-tech attractions of modern Singapore, and I do hope that it doesn't get swept away to make room for something with more ""relevance"" to the 21st century ...

Apparently one man, now in his early eighties, has been maintaining and restoring the figures for decades, but he could probably do with some help, as there are areas which are looking rather shabby and neglected. (This is why I have given four rather than five stars).

As well, this was a chance to learn something about the developers of Tiger Balm, and it's quite a sad story ... You can still see a model of the original villa, and there are monuments to family members in the grounds.

The site can get very hot and there is little shade. There is one area which has a vending machine where cold drinks can be obtained, with a few tables and chairs. That's it. It's probably a good idea to bring a hat and a bottle of water. It's probably not a good idea to bring very young children unless you want to answer difficult questions about some of the statues or deal with tears in the face of the gory Ten Courts of Hell exhibit.

This was turned over to an exhibit which primarily honors Buddhism. You can find out more by going inside the Jade House Visitor's Center. This park is open to the public from 0900 to 2130 daily. There is no charge for entering, but there is a charge of $10 for a guided tour. Be prepared to do lots of walking, since you start climbing the hill on a slope right away. There is some car parking inside, although the main lot is at the bottom of the hill. The park is easily accessible via SMRT and MRT stops right outside of it. The main ""attraction"" is the Courts of Hell Museum and Exhibit. It certainly details the Buddhist concept of life after death and the punishment for sin (be prepared for some pretty gory stuff!). No sin goes unpunished. Yet at the end of the 10 courts, the dead are reincarnated via samsara after being made to forget all that has gone before. It is quite sad, actually, and forces one to soberly examine one's own life.

It was a like a private tour really. Fascinating history and mythology behind each of the sculptures which gave me loads of context to then explore the park by myself for another hour or so.

As long as you're not easily offended, go check out the Ten Courts of Hell on your way out. Shocking, gruesome, and somewhat funny to boot.

Overall, one of the best things to do in Singapore. It's so weird and wonderful that you're unlikely to discover much else like it in the world.

,1,37,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/LawrenceP518,671562214,05-05-2019,4,A Benign Battlefield,"Just off Singapore’s West Coast Highway, with its own Mass Rapid Transit station, Haw Par Villa is a welcome break from the city state’s overwhelming skyscrapers, conventions and relentless modernity.

This attraction is popular with western tourists especially; having seen all the obvious sights (or skipped them completely) there’s unique interest and entertainment to be found here.

On display are figures depicting Chinese culture’s big three: Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, plus mythology and history. Exhibits include elaborate dioramas with life-size figurines. The characters are from Monkey Mountain, Virtues and Vices, Journey to the West, The Water Margin, Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea and the gruesome Courts of Hell.

To call Haw Par Villa gaudy is like calling Mr. Ronaldo a football player; it hardly needs saying. However, as your eyes adjust to the concrete/wire frame sculptures, you begin to read in its iterations another, non-verbal way of gathering information.
A half-fish, half-human figure recalls Hieronymus Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. Other delights include a fight between rats and rabbits, a crab lady and more – I don’t want to spoil it.

You may be forgiven for thinking it all landed here from space; in fact, it was channelled through the hands of two Chinese Tiger Balm magnates who migrated here from Burma (Myanmar), as it was then known; in 1937 Boon Haw built Haw Par Villa as a gift for his brother, Boon Par. Initially private property, the brothers opened it up to the public, ostensibly to educate the world about Chinese cultural values and ethics, while plugging Tiger Balm products to boot.

This benign battlefield would not be the place to try to teach morals to children, as generations of locals I spoke to attested; as kids, this experience was more likely to ‘freak (them) out’. In modern life, the more obvious reaction is to see it as kitsch, selfie material, so don’t worry if you’re bringing your kids – just get into fun mode (with the possible exception of the Courts of Hell)! Signs prohibiting people from climbing on the statues bear this out. This would clearly amount to wear and tear, though charging a ‘selfie fee’ for a little more than projected maintenance costs could, I thought, be a solution for an ill-attended site.
Though there is information on plates in front of most of the figures, it’s still possible to find yourself confused by the kitschy offerings. To bring the stories into relatable human experience, the invaluable paying tour (around Sin $5.5, or $4 US) focuses on the trials and tribulations of the Aw brothers whose gloriously weird project this was. It lasts an hour, starting at 10 am and 4 pm.

Do save the hell experience for the end (it needs to be taken with a pinch of salt). The whole experience will take around an hour and a half. The rest of the park is out of doors, save the humble indoor museum, which is air-conditioned. Light snacks and drinks are available at the shop cabin, half-way up the incline to the left of the path.

My first return visit was like a trip down the memory lane. Although quite vaguely, I can still recall some of the sculptures that appeared in my childhood photos; they are still very much the same albeit with a new coat of paint.

Whilst I’m proud of the many “likes” the Park received from foreign visitors’ reviews here, I’m a little perplexed by the not-so-appreciative comments, more so coming from the locals. I like to think that the more constructive comments have been heard and currently, efforts are put in to improve the place, if not make it more interesting to visit - like having guided day tours and weekly night tours, but please be forewarned that these are no “free lunches”.

As maintenance and repainting work are currently ongoing, you may spot the artisans at work during your visit; please be kind to them, if not spare them a simple appreciative gesture. I come to know from a youtube video entitled “The Last Artisan” that delays in upkeeping the sculptures was partly due to difficulties in getting successors to Mr Teo – a gentleman who has devoted 70 odd years of his life keeping the sculptures here in good shape and colour; something that not just requires a high level of skills, but lots of devotion and dedication. In his 80s, he is now the last artisan standing after all his fellow artisans had left or retired. Thankfully, the Park had managed to seek 2 potential successors to understudy him and hopefully, they will stay on to continue upkeep the sculptures.

The selfish side of me should be least bothered that this place is not popular with locals nor tourists as it means I can enjoy the peace and tranquility whenever I visit the Park. But of course, that’s against the primary intention of its original owners. Thanks to the Aw brothers who were well-known for their Tiger Balm brands of medical products, what was once a part of a private residence built in 1937 soon became accessible to the general public. Such generosity is but one of the many the moral values they intend to share with visitors as demonstrated in the many dioramas and sculptures displayed around the park.

This place is like an open-air art-gallery although the more famous Ten Courts of Hell is housed within shelter. In its 80s’ heydays, this shelter was a 60 metre long Chinese Dragon which is often pictured in post cards then but this structure was later demolished for economic reasons.

One may also see pagoda-like structures erected within the park; these are the memorials for the Aw family members including the Aw brothers. If you noticed, the biggest and better-placed pagoda was built for their parents – a demonstration of their filial piety, which is very much a core Chinese value.

There are over 1000 sculptures in the Park, many of which are meant to depict the Chinese traditional culture, beliefs and mythologies. However, you may be amused to spot a few sculptures with international appeal – a statue of liberty, sumo wrestlers, thai-dancer, Balinese mythical beings and scenes, etc. Whilst these sculptures should never be compared with the Michelangelo’s, many of them are exquisite in their own rights, thanks to the artisans at work during those early years. My favourites are those depicting the scenes of famous myths/novels like the Eight Immortals and Fengsheng Bang.

If time permits, one should read the brief write-ups besides the dioramas/sculptures in order to appreciate them more. But even by simply admiring them per se, we are constantly reminded of the moral lessons they try to demonstrate which originated from the Buddhist/Taoist/Confuscious teachings.

I may be wrong but I guess they built the Ten Courts of Hell as a final reminder to all mortals like us to abstain from bad deeds and behaviours. Possibly the biggest of its kind in the world, the Courts of Hell were well organised and presented although the depictions of Hell scenes are quite graphic and can be intriguing to some whilst daunting to others. So for the young and less-strong-at-heart, you have a choice to bypass totally, make a u-turn any time or exit by the side door at the mid-way point. For most others, my advice is to step in with an open-mind and be rewarded visually, if not spiritually.

The best time to visit the Park is from 9am (opening time) when the sun is not too unbearable, and finishing off at the Ten Courts of Hell which is sheltered and near the entrance/exit; average duration should be around 2 hours for the whole park. Otherwise, visit from 4 to 5pm in the reverse order; take note that the Ten Courts of Hell closes at 6pm, 1 hour before the Park’s gate is shut.",05-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 09:29:03.417459

The reason is that when I was a mere infant, my father was based at RAF Changi in the 1950s. One of the places we visited was the Haw Par Villa, or Tiger Balm Gardens. Since then, the place has been shown less love and has fewer visitors, and yet, and yet, and yet ...

Yes, I still love the place. I have a favourite grotto where I had a stolen kiss. I have a favourite tiger. I enjoy one gruesome depiction. I enjoy the moralistic miniature dioramas. I love the hill with the monkeys, my favourite being the monkey with the camera. The big Happy Buddha one sees upon arrival is still a big favourite of mine, and as I have aged, so I see a certain family resemblance, and it's not the smile!

The darkened grotto of the Ten Courts of Hell, is not for the faint hearted. You are most likely to walk out off there thinking you've had it in the afterlife, since many pleasures (i.e. sins) involve rather nasty things being done to one's person. Despite my several visits to Hell, I have not changed my ways. As it seems I""m doomed already, I'm going to go Hell for leather with whipped cream and a glacé cherry on top!

Yes I love the place, childhood romance and memories of a simpler time for me and the world are all tied up with it. I wish it could be shown more love and the statues and dioramas taken better care of.

I have excluded one grisly image from the set as I am concerned it would not pass censorship. What I will say is, it may not match what happens in modern violent movies, but I think it still has a power to stop you in your tracks, albeit for a small moment.

If you ever visit the Haw Par Villa, think of a young European child in the 1950s seeing this for the first time and that child is still fascinated by it some sixty years later. Approach the place with a child's imagination and I hope you will be as enchanted I was then, and still am to some degree now.",03-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 09:29:11.178099

The most intriguing attraction in the park is the Levels of Hell depicting gruesome images of life in Hell according to the sins you commit. Completely fascinating stuff and very enjoyable if you're not the queasy kind. Entry is free, it's on a hill nearly adjacent to the Haw Par MRT. Carry a cap or umbrella because the pathways aren't covered, and wear trainers because there's a lot of wlaking to do.

There is a small shop in the premises where you can buy just chips, a few souveniers, cold drinks and water. It would be nice to have a restaurant selling, if nothing else, fast food. All that walking in the tropical ehat makes one hungry!

In 1937 Aw Boon Haw (Tiger) decided to build this beautiful Villa for his younger brother, Aw Boon Par (Leopard). Hence the name Haw Par Villa, the Villa of Tiger and Leopard.
With myth and stories from Buddhism, Toaism and Chinese Folklore, it intertwined to creat this fascinating, even trippy Garden of wax figurines. It has lots of gore, violence and even nudity depicted here. And to boggle the mind further, there are some totally out of place foreign figurine added to the mix.
To be there, one needed to suspense one's belief and logic and just be weirdly surprise by all that are in display there.
Be warned that not all figurines are child friendly, the most infamous display is in the Ten Gates of Hell tunnel. Well, most of the kids born in the 80s and before had been scared shitless in this tunnel. There was a time it can be ""enjoyed"" by taking a boat ride through this tunnel of hell. Imagine those kids that were tricked into this ride by their parents, it must have left a scar. So be warned!
The entrance is free and it is open from 9am to 7pm, with a MRT conveniently locate beside it.

It's a park full of brightly painted sculptures and dioramas that I, as a westerner, found very amusing and bizarre. I went on my own but can't wait to bring my wife and teenage kids there for a good laugh. Many of the scenes were quite graphic (depictions of violence and 'adult' concepts) so parents of young kids might want to go to Sentosa instead.
I was there on a hot afternoon and was very glad I took water with me - there didn't seem to be any shop or kiosk open when I was there, and there's some shade but not much. Good thing there was only me and a few other people there.
It seems like the type of place that used to be popular...but not now. The whole place looks a bit...tired. Some of the older, more faded sculptures were being refurbished so hopefully that's an indication that the park is there to stay. It's on prime land that is ripe for re-development so I'd say don't wait too long to see it.
It's not a big park but it's on a hill with a variety of paths from roads to rickety narrow paths with steps so wheelchair access would be somewhat limited but not impossible. Older visitors might struggle with the incline and dodgy paths.
I wouldn't come here for a picnic as I remember seeing a sign about not bringing your own food - maybe that was an old sign from back when the park was a bustling hive of activity with a busy shop and cafe. The only staff I saw there was 1 or 2 painters...no-one likely to tell you off for bringing food. Entry was free...or maybe there was just no-one on duty to sell me a ticket.

A short walk uphill will lead you into the park, and to the first of the statues. There are several different sections, with signs describing what is going on in each. Some are a little grisly, but the only I would not recommend for children is the 10 Levels of Hell. The others may be a little gory, but nothing a well adjusted child won't be able to deal with, but the 10 Levels of Hell is designed to creep out and shock, dark with red lighting and very graphic and gory displays.

The statues are unlike anything I have ever seen! The ten courts of hell section was very educational I learnt things about reincarnation I didn’t know and the scenes depicted were great.

We took our time going around all the statues and reading the plaques, each one giving us something to talk about and we had so much fun taking photos.

The museum is a real gem, I had no idea the history of the park and the family it belonged to was as colourful as the statues. So intriguing!

This park was a highlight of our trip, and amazing that it’s free, we would easily have paid at least a little something for the experience.

We were looking for something to do that was a bit off the beaten track. Well, we got more than we bargained for here!

There's a whole back story to Haw Par Villa which is quite interesting. Built in 1937, the park was originally called Tiger Balm Gardens and, as you no doubt guessed from the name, the park was built by brothers Aw Boon Haw and Aw Boon Par, who were the creators of Tiger Balm. Through the 80s and 90s, the park was modernized and lost huge amounts of money and never really became the oriental Disneyland that they had hoped for. Thankfully, the park now remains and is free for all the enter.

The park itself is full of colourful and strange depictions of scenes that were supposed to represent Chinese values and Chinese mythology. There's over 1000 statues and 150 dioramas. Most of these feature some pretty interesting combinations of violence or people combined with animals and all kinds of strange visuals. At times however, some scenes are actually quite dramatic or beautiful... It's a real mixed bag!

As a visiting group of adults, it was good fun and quite quirky. Definitely something different to do. It's pretty hot to walk around a big park for a couple of hours but it's worth it. I would say, however that I'm not sure some of the depictions would really be suitable for children. Especially the end walk through section where there's various scenes of people being tortured or are in hell for their various sins.

The naked, gory, and unabashedly weird animal-headed humans were to teach kids what not to do, but now it's more humorous as an adult. There are some kid-safe classic stories made into sculptures, but it's not as easy to appreciate

The park is changing, and now new enterprises are moving in to set up galleries of their own in the park. I was not able to visit them this trip, but it looks promising for a re-visit.",10-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 09:31:07.007840

You can go to Haw Par station and the park is right outside. It was created by the founders of Tiger Balm who were born in Myanmar, but moved to and continued to live in Singapore.

The Ten courts of hell is the main feature, but this can be gory for some. Basically, depending on what your sin is, you endure some form of torture and die, but in the end you drink a magic tea, come back in another life and don't remember how you sinned or what you endured. I know one 8 year old, who did not seem freaked out in the 10 courts of hell, started balling after his father scared him when we had just exited. The crying continued for a good 5 minutes. I would not take a kid under 10 to this unless the kid is use to horror stuff.

Apart from the courts of hell, there are some amazing statues, building, fauna and flora...a few turtles live in one of the ponds.

It can get busy and you will have to deal with the tourists that run in front of every statue and want a selfie or pic with it.

It is outdoor and is in Singapore, so it does get hot and can also rain. Bring sunblock, sunglasses, water and an umbrella.

I would recommend going here as I have not seen anything like this anywhere that I have traveled to before.",09-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 09:31:07.331933

I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the displays. Although it was evident that some of them needed repainting, they were very colorful, and explanations of what the scenes depicted were written in English at the front of each of them.

Yes, some of the displays can be a bit confronting and gory, but I really expected to be more shocked than I was. Actually, there were many displays which weren't in the least bit confronting and which were sculptures of beautiful animals and traditional scenes.

There weren't many people there on a Tuesday when I visited and the atmosphere in the park was very relaxing. There are plenty of seats to sit on to watch the cute squirrels run around.

Luckily, there was a nice breeze blowing while I was there or I suspect it could have been very hot. Take plenty of water with you because I didn't see any taps when walking between the displays. However, I imagine that there would have been somewhere to fill up water bottles at the toilets near the entry.
