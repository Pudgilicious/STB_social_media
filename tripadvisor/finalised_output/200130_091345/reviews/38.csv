In the colonial days of British rule, it served as the army barracks and its headquarters.

It is worth climbing the stairs to the top of the hill to get a good view of the city.

The area has the Fort Canning Arts Centre - an impressive looking building; the Register of Marriages; and the artillery. The area hosts various concerts.

Great tour of the underground HQ itself via Battle Box tours.

The hill itself is an elliptical path around the hill with various informative signs throughout, mostly historic in nature. In general a nice quiet route with some glimpses of the city through the high trees. Unfortunately, and this causes the downgrade, one can not go to the top of the hill for a much broader view as there is a wired off reservoir on the summit, with those nasty little signs showing an individual pointing a gun at another all around...unfortunate.

Buy your tickets for the guided tour which is the only way to see inside. The young guide who conducted our varied group of about 15 people was professional, knowledgeable, measured in presentation and very personable. As she conducted us from room to room, a terrible tale unfolded of English capitulation to a clever and organised enemy that resulted in the taking of Singapore. Rooms contain old equipment and realistic representations featuring excellent Madame Tussaud-like historical figures which help bring the tale to life. A throughly enjoyable and informative one-hour tour that is well worth the admission fee.

The park is situated on a steep hill immediately behind Clarke Quay, so is very central and easy to get to.

There are also some impressive historical buildings dotted around the park as well as the WWII underground military operations bunker, now known as the BattleBox Museum, which is well worth a visit to do the highly informative 1 hr guided tour.

There is an art gallery in the park with a delightful café in which I would definitely recommend - especially the sundae's which cost $9 and worth every cent.

The UK were fighting in the four corners of the world let's not forget, and to stop the loss of anymore civilian life and to be able to bury the dead, was a huge factor in the surrender.

To bring to life the rich history of the Hill, developments to Fort Canning Park and its surroundings are being carried out.

The Battlebox was a British Army Command Centre located 9 metres underground, in the 1930s. It was part of the headquarters of the army that defended Singapore during World War II. It was also the site where Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival made the fateful decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942.

The Park is must see place while visiting Singapore. Easy to reach by MRT from any part of the City. Get down at Dhoby Ghaut & look for Exit- B to come up to road level. Walk across to the Bus bay for Padestrian Crossing. Then take your left & walk straight. It leads to the Park.

Here's your chance!,"Fort Canning Park, a hilltop landmark, once sited the palaces of 14th century Kings and served as the Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks. The decision to surrender Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942 was also made on the hill, in the Underground Far East Command Centre, commonly known as Battle Box.

The opportunity to get out of the blazing sun and walk beneath the cooling shade of beautiful old trees is too good to resist, and Fort Canning Park is a great way to do it. With a wealth of history to explore, and views down over Singapore, it's a good place to while away some time.

the Park is easy to get to, with a choice of three MRT stations: Fort Canning (Downtown line, Exit B), Clarke Quay (North East line, Exit E) or Dhoby Ghaut (North South and North East lines, Exit B).",02-2019,Couples,2020-01-30 09:33:56.936320

,1,38,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/TeganThomas,642667463,31-12-2018,5,Jewel in the City's Crown,"Singapore has many charming and idilic locations but Fort Canning Park remains my favourite place in the City State. We walked thought it many times in the 1980’s when it was pretty much derelict, evocative and slightly eerie but today it provides a beautiful, elevated, shady oasis of tranquility overlooking and overlooked by the frenetic City. Fort Canning Park is steeped in history from the ancient and pre-colonial eras to the fall of Empires, it is or has been the abode of Kings, a botanic garden, a cemetery, a fortress, place of government, a park and to visit it is an education. We have always stayed on Orchard Road and walk through Fort Canning Park when we visit China Town, the CBD, the Bay Area, the Colonial District, sometimes we go there just to enjoy the Park it’s self. The Park is quite small but so full of interest that it can fill at least half, possible a whole day. Some of the things to do; visit the cemetery with it’s Gothic Gates, cupolas and memorials, review the memorial stones and appreciate how very short were the lives of the early settlers and traders. View the colonial buildings that grace the park, one is now the Fort Canning Hotel the other the Fort Canning Centre, both are architecturally significant. Walk the Spice Garden, FCP was part of the original botanic garden and many experimental plants were grown here, a small botanic trail remains and the plaques are most informative. See the archeological excavations in progress, they are open to public view, well described and have many interesting artefacts to illustrate the history of this once forbidden hill. Visit the Old Lighthouse and learn about its technical evolution and the courage of those who risked their lives to care for it during the Japanese occupation. Take a look at the Time Ball that marked 13:00 each day and the historic Flag Staff, both are close to the site of Raffle’s bungalow and well described by boards at their locations. Visit the (alleged but unlikely) tomb of Iskander Shah and read the myth of his violent accession to the throne of ancient Singapore (Tamasek). Walk the terraces named after the influential men who made and managed Singapore, Raffles, Farquhar, Bond, Lewin, Dobbie and others. Visit the military installations and buildings, the great gates of the fort itself (try pushing them closed!), escape through the Sally Port, pose for photos on the old cannons and if you get the opportunity book on a guided tour of the hill itself and of the Battle Box, both are thoroughly worth while if you have any interest in history and the lives of those who made Singapore’s history. Apart from the history, the flora and fauna are surprisingly rich and varied for a small City centre park, Red Junglefowl scratch around, sunbirds can be heard and occasionally glimpsed and apparently the park is popular with local ornithologists. Walk the Tree Route, many of the trees are quite magnificent and there are numerous photo opportunities which, with a little framing will give the appearance of being taken in deep jungle not a city centre. If you are keen to work out, join those who run up and down the steps at Canning Rise, jog the paths that weave through park or visit the fitness station near Badang Terrace. If you want a break from exploring the park, the National Museum of Singapore is accessible directly from the hill and apart from the exhibitions there is also a very nice restaurant that serves tea from the Clipper Tea Company and delicious cakes. The Park is delightful after dark, I sometimes take a stroll there to enjoy the tranquility and let my imagination wonder to those ancient Malay Kings whose graves lie still undiscovered in this very special place.",12-2018,Couples,2020-01-30 09:34:06.383887

But Fort Canning Park (Singapore) offers more than leisure and recreation. It is a park rich in history. Sitting at the hilltop, it has witnessed many of the country’s historical milestones. Apparently, it used to site palaces before the founding of modern Singapore. It was made Headquarters of the Far East Command Centre and British Army Barracks during the colonial days. The decision to surrender to the Japanese in 1942 was also made on the hill.

I have been to Fort Canning Park on several occasions but for events – outdoor concerts, movie screening under the stars, hotel dining, etc. This visit I recently made was a different one where I took time walking through and around the park.

There are a number of walking trails rich in history presented by replicas of a past era such as flagstaff, lighthouse and 9-pound cannon, ruins of the fort left along with preserved underground tunnels.

This park is right in the centre of the city but yet away from the hustle and bustle of city life. It is somewhat strange to see in the backdrop around the park with skyscrapers on one side, the riverside / quays on another, and yet a serene view of a church just down the hill. And for the romantic, the park is also a favourite photo-shoot venue for weddings as it is neighbour to the ROM (Registry of Marriages).

It is also a home to the arts, playing hosts to concerts, theatre productions and festivals. The lush greenery and expansive lawns offer a variety of arts, heritage and nature experiences. The Fort Canning Arts Centre was undergoing some upgrading when I visited and as I understand, it is part of the enhancements to Fort Canning Park and its surroundings which will be progressively completed from June 2019.

If you are a history puff and enjoy a leisurely walk in a park under the cool umbrellas of trees (my favourite has to be the Banyan Trees), come visit the park. Or if you want an early morning jog around the greenery on a hilltop, this is a good place to sweat it out. Should you plan to visit during organised events, make time before / after the activity to see what this park has to offer.

From some National Parks Singapore materials, development plans are underway ""where the heritage landscapes of Fort Canning Hill and its surroundings will be restored and weaved seamlessly into Fort Canning Park with the creation of three gardens, namely the Royal Garden, the First Botanic Garden, and Jubilee Park"".

Make a date and visit the Park in the latter half of 2019.",10-2018,Solo,2020-01-30 09:36:49.763329

From Clarke Quay you can go up and be in the green. Old trees...big , with hudge crowns offering a lot of shade at noon. Couple of old houses including the Raffels one. Couple of canons, old fort walls, Museum (Pinacotheque de Paris)",02-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:39:52.790817

It is hilly and has quite a few steps but is a beautiful place which nature lovers will enjoy.. Hosts plays and shows from time to time so might be worth checking out if they are hosting anything when you plan to visit,01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:39:53.077382

Great to walk around. The archeological excavations are particularly interesting and if you are here during Shakespeare in the park it's worth getting a ticket,01-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:39:53.449827

But a climb up the steps with stops to admire the view on the way was worthwhile. It was much cooler amongst the trees than at ground level.,03-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 09:39:53.825198

Neat pathways, well-maintained gardens and beautifully set out. This is a real haven right in the middle of Singapore.",12-2015,Friends,2020-01-30 09:40:00.349202
