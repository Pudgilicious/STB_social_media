The members of my family with us were children living in Singapore during the time period the exhibit is showcasing. It was fascinating to see the time period in which they grew up and how different it was to the time period I grew up in. I immediately knew it was authentic when my aunt began to freak out when we entered the first room.

Guan really made the tour fun, unique, informative, and engaging. He would involve both the younger and older members of our group by making jokes and asking us to make guesses about what certain rooms and objects were meant for.

In summary, this tour was unexpected in its quality in the best of ways and I would recommend it to any of my friends heading to Singapore.",07-2019,Family,2020-01-30 10:02:23.007950

One of the most interesting and thought provoking museums we have visited in a long time, and we only called in because it was there and the guidebook recommended it – to think we could have missed it as we hadn't planned to stop off here.
The audio guide is perfect and takes you through the three floors of the centre, and a journey through the lives of the Chinese in Singapore.

Once inside, you are greeted with a counter and nondescript decor. The magic starts once you start the tour and dial up the audio tour. They have cleverly recreated a Chinese tailor business from the decades ago and also the lives of people who share the shophouse. There is no doubt that living is hard but they form their own tiny community which make the most of very limited resources. The museum is compact but every inch is used to good effect.
The only negative is that the story is very monotonal so if you are interested in that era and local Chinese history then you are in for a treat but a tourist just walking off the street and expecting an ""entertaining"" experience may find the going a bit tough and long-winded.

The place is very small, but the effort, authenticity and planning put into this centre really makes the experience shine.
The level of detail put into re-creating the living conditions of Chinese immigrants in the 50's is wonderful and put's into perspective how lucky many of us are in this 21st century (Imaging 40 inhabitants of a shop house, sharing one shower, with inconsistent water pressure and one toilet, which is just a hole in the ground with a bucket)
For any with Chinese ethnicity, this is a must visit, while the Shop House recreation is from a Singapore perspective, many of the exhibits are relatable to the millions of Chinese who have emigrated from China to the rest of the world in the last 150 years and many of the items are instantly recognisable. It brings home the perspective of how much our forefathers (and mothers) suffered to build a better world for their children and descendents, it can be quite humbling in that respect.
This is a wonderful example of how to build a centre which educates and preseves culture - Well done, Heritage centre.
Note, I expected to take less than an hour on this centre, however, given the audio clips on the guided tour, I was in the centre for close to 2 hours.
Also there are quite a few seats dotted around the exhibits/areas, so you can sit and listen as the Shop House comes alive with the sounds and experience.",07-2018,Family,2020-01-30 10:02:59.289959

Personally I had vague recollections of some of the things I saw but I definitely felt the connection and there were some moving moments for me too! We created our own self guided quiet tour and we took our time. My mum's maid also felt emotional because she was reminded of her family in Myanmar.

The cramped fivefootways, dingy alleys and raucous street hawkers are relics of Chinatown’s past.

Yet pockets of history remain in Chinatown, along with more modern sights. You could easily spend a few days wandering through these still-narrow streets.

Family-run goldsmiths, medicinal halls and teahouses ply their trades next to sleeker neighbours such as hipster bars and lifestyle shops.

If you’re a foodie, try ‘char kway teow’ (stir-fried noodles) and ‘satay’ (barbecued meat skewers) at Chinatown Food Street, a row of hawker stalls, shophouse restaurants and kiosks along Smith Street.

For trendier tastes, chic restaurants and bars are in Neil Road, Duxton Road and Keong Saik Road. The vibe is electric in Club Street and Ann Siang Road on Friday and Saturday nights, when locals and expats head down for dinner and drinks.

Want to shop? Buy souvenirs in Pagoda Street, ‘bak kwa’ (barbecued meat) in New Bridge Road or traditional Chinese medicine in South Bridge Road.

Chinatown is where Hindu temples and mosques sit right next to Chinese temples. Sri Mariamman Temple and Jamae Mosque are on South Bridge Road, as is the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.

Best of all, there’s free Wi-Fi throughout the Chinatown area so you can continue to be plugged in while you sightsee, shop and eat.",05-2016,Family,2020-01-30 10:04:02.950037

Visit the old shop houses and imagine how a family of four might have lived happily in one (necessarily) very neat and tidy room, a small cooking stove, and a kitchen/wash area. A cradle hangs from the ceiling. Then discover the history of the Samui women, who laboured and built the initial infrastructure brick by brick, never marrying, in order to devote themselves to the building of their city. Outside the Heritage Centre in Chinatown, there is a stone statue of a Samui labourer, adorned by her red headscarf and concentrating on her labours. Singapore is liberal in its welcoming of all religions and none. Buddhist and Hindu temples reside side by side, as do Christian churches. Not so liberal however is the legal system. Be aware that, although Singapore practices the Common Law of England and Wales, they too have their parallel legislative provisions: Do Not smoke e cigarettes in Singapore - do not even bring them in your luggage. Do Not chew gum on the street, or worse, throw it on the pavement. A quest for interesting restaurants can guide you to Cuppage Street.

Somewhat like the Tenement Museum in NYC, a visitor gets a vivid sense of how difficult life truly was for these newcomers. The shophouses of Singapore (many of the remaining ones have have been remade into upscale bars and restaurants) housed businesses on the street level, the family living above, and newcomers crowded into awfully basic quarters above that.

There is information on the general history of Chinatown - but the real attraction is the restoration or reconstruction of a Chinatown building as it was in the 1950’s. The building includes a tailor shop, his workshop, his family living quarters, kitchen, toilet, apprentice quarters and accommodation rented to other families and individuals. It is a fascinating and thought provoking look into the llives of the people who actually lived in Chinatown at that time. The exhibits really brings to life their living and working conditions.

Two comments:

By virtue of the actual size of the tailors building space is limited so I guess it could become crowded (maybe the numbers entering are controlled at reception - I don’t know?)

The history is pretty specific to Chinatown so don’t expect to learn too much about the wider Singapore population. (It is the Chinatown museum and there are other places to visit to to get the wider history).

Located within three restored shophouses it recreates the hard life of the tenants in their eight feet by eight feet wooden cubicle homes in the 1950s. The landlords would partition their shophouses into these little cubicles with maybe a small table and stool and a bench with matting for the beds (and they sometimes housed eight people including children) in order to ease the housing shortage and make money as well. With the help of the audio guide we gazed in awe at the way these people lived - their lack of comfort with very steep stairs, no privacy, cooling (sometimes no window) or heating and communal bathrooms and kitchens.

Not all of them Chinese but a good many vendors are of Indian origin. There's an Indian temple close by and makes it look a bit more like Little India than Chinatown.
The Heritage Centre is a multiple storey building in the middle of the lane. The front is just like any upscale shop with merchandise but the inside is where it gets interesting. The lasting impression I will carry is of the surprise I felt on going into the first viewing area - the place looked like a dump. It is actually an exact re-creation of how the Chinese lived and worked, during their early days here. The setting is of a tailor shop with the living quarters of the tailor and his family, along with a number of apprentices. There's more, such as the far more sophisticated setting of the house and clinic of a Chinese physician.
The museum brings alive minute details of their daily life, from the clothes they wore to the utensils they used. From their manner of worship to their art. A good place to visit, esp now that the Chinese scenario is entirely different.

On that last comment... (the one of the attention span), the museum is designed in a way that you should reflect a little bit on the evolution of society and human treatment. If you are not a person that likes to reflect nor likes museums I would recommend you to go somewhere else, not that I think you won't find anything interesting, but you might annoy others trying to enjoy the experience and this can lead to several people staring at you.

Now, going back to the heritage centre. As mentioned in other reviews, the ticket includes the audio guide and I highly recommend you to use it because it gives you information that is not available on the labels describing the scene.

Another important aspect to mention is, you need to be aware of the amount of stuff you have with you. If for some reason you are coming from the street markets and you have lots of bags, or a backpack, you mindful and careful when going to level 2 and 3... when using the stairs really. These stairs are quite steep and you should watch your steps when going up or down, or be prepared to roll down.

We were walking down Pagoda Street on Saturday evening, enjoying the cool air, wondering what new changes had taken place in Chinatown since we last walked this street two years ago when we brought our Canadian visitors there.

Lo and behold, in the midst of the Chinese cafes, restaurants and tourist shops, we chanced upon the Chinatown Heritage Centre. We decided to pop in and see if this is worth recommending to our overseas visitors when they visit us. We had absolutely no regrets, whatsoever.

For $15 per pax, we got a multimedia guide and a wonderful reminder of the history of the Chinese in Singapore. We spent 2-3 very entertaining, very enjoyable hours in the centre, learning new things as well as recalling our childhood and teenage years growing up in colonial Singapore on the cusp of independence and in the early postcolonial period.

The displays were presented with stories of the real families and individuals who lived in that shophouse. With the multimedia guide, the displays invite the visitor to relive the lives of those families, their daily challenges, their happy moments, their problems, the support they received from the community of tenants living on the same floors in the same building.

It is spread across several adjoining shop-houses above the market street so it is much bigger than it seems at first glance. The restored residences follow the lives of a few families known to have lived in the district - a tailor, an apothecary, a street vendor, a carpenter and how they lived in dense proximity to each other in conditions of doubtful sanitation.

More insightful than what is presented at the Singapore National Museum which is more a statement of national identity and pride whereas this is a historical record, made up in part by individual testimony by people who were there.
Fascinating story of Chinese immigration, the developing communities (yes warts and all) and the impressive (no t's astounding) transformation that has been achieved by this city state in the space of 60 years.
You walk through a recreated tailors shop, work room and his living room (including toilet and bathroom). Upstairs you see the fully but sparsely furnished single boarding alcoves where whole families lived, then there's the opium dens, the Chinese secret societies and gang violence. It's all here and all narrated by an excellent commentary on audio sticks.

It took me back to the early 20th century through the life of the original inhabitants within the shophouse that this museum now occupies.

There are three levels inside this mini-museum. The first level is a detailed glimpse at a well known tailor's living quarters, showroom, and workshop, which occupies most of the first floor. It also houses the kitchen of the tailor's wife and the living quarters of his apprentices.

The second level is the living quarters of the rest of the tenants including a trishaw driver, samsui women, a cobbler who made red clogs, and a doctor and his family.

The third level is a glimpse at the seedy underbelly of old Singapore's hidden society. A world that included prostitutes who led tragic, hopeless lives, opium addicts, gamblers, and secret societies, which functioned like mafiosi.

The other half of the third level is also a great guide into all the ethnicities that populated Singapore in the early days - the Hokkiens, Hainans, Cantonese, Parsis, and the different Indian communities. I even learned about the kind of cuisine that each ethnic group was famous for and where to eat it in Chinatown right there and then.

The staff were all very helpful and friendly. They allowed me to leave my bag with them before I explored the museum. And the old man by the entrance of the shophouse gave me step-by-step instructions on how to take in the tour.

It's hard to believe that almost a hundred inhabitants were able to cram themselves into the shophouse - but that was the kind of life they had back then.

Overall, this was a touching, even humbling experience - especially when I found out how the original migrants arrived via what they used to call ""hell ships"" (imagine hundred of people crammed into one small boat, which could easily sink and with no space to move and being stuck in that position for weeks) and were forced to be super thrifty and resourceful just so they could survive.",02-2017,Solo,2020-01-30 10:09:40.127179

The Centre is easy to find and after paying the entrance fee you get a set of headphones and a mobile device for your interactive tour - self paced.

The first and second floor show life in the ""old days"" and give a pretty good, really good, insight how life was back then. The interactive guide does a great job and is very well made.

In the shophouse museum over three floors -families lived and worked in small rooms. The owner of the building was a tailor...employing staff and apprentices... the owner had small room, maybe 3 metres square - where he and his wife plus children all lived...it was hard to imagine.

On the upperfloors other families lived in similar conditions.

Part of the tour shows how the area developed, work conditions outside - and how people survived to the Chinatown we know today.

The recreations of businesses and (squalid) living conditions were generally well executed, and are worth the ticket price. These displays don't have captions, so you need to listen to the audio commentary provided with your ticket - this was fairly interesting, but the commentary for some elements was a bit too lengthy.

The main failing of the museum is that while it does a good job of illustrating how tough living conditions were for Chinatown's residents (including some surprisingly sensitive discussion on why opium was widely used), it doesn't really explain how the area changed from a slum into a tourist zone, and what the locals thought of this. Presumably most were pleased to receive a HDB flat, but this process isn't explored. In addition, the section of the museum on living conditions emphasises solidarity among inhabitants of the crowded housing, which sits awkwardly with the displays on the top floor which provide a fairly frank discussion of the predatory conduct which often occurred. Who profited from maintaining the slums and why they weren't stopped earlier also isn't addressed.

We were greeted by friendly staff who gave us instructions and the audio guide that you need for the center, and were sent on our way.

The center is set up in a building that replicates the style Chinese immigrants in Singapore might occupy - it's very narrow and rather cramped when you get a lot of people inside, but it gives an even more authentic feel to what it must have been like living during this time.

The audio guide introduces you to the kinds of work Chinese immigrants would have to do to support their families through the stories of various house-members, which made the narrative come alive. I went away feeling like I understood an important part of Chinese culture, inspired by the grit and perseverance these people exhibited to survive the grueling conditions in Chinatown years ago.

You definitely need the audio guide and be prepared to be a bit patient with the other guests - as it is a small place you have to navigate around others in the small rooms.

I grabbed a headset at the door and stayed to listen to all the talks about each room. It is kind of a reenactment of life in the early days of Chinatown and although it was kind of ""Hollywood"" I really have to say I learned a lot and really enjoyed it. It was a terrific break from the brutal heat of the Singapore afternoon sun and there really was so much to see and learn about. It did not disappoint me at all!",02-2017,Friends,2020-01-30 10:12:05.300089

Most eye it curiously, as they walk past. Ever since it went through a major overhaul in curation, renovation & technological updates, visiting The Chinatown Heritage Centre became an enlightening, surprising learning experience.

This exhibit has 2 parts:
1) The timeline of the Chinese diaspora to Nanyang (Southern Ocean Frontier), specifically the island of Singapore, chronicles the treacherous ocean trip, the different groups of Chinese, their trades & industry in Singapore under the British, the clans, entertainment, schools, food & festivals.
2) A sample 3-storey Chinatown shophouse curated with old items from people who have lived in one of these shophouses. You'd see cramp living quarters and even hear the sounds of life in these shophouses -- albeit in air-conditioned comfort.

As my maternal grandparents and my father had migrated to Singapore, this heritage centre enlightened me to the life that easily forgotten, in modern metropolis Singapore. Definitely worth a visit.",11-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:12:05.690190

For the locals, it is a place when the grannies would regale their grandchildren about the old times in Chinatown where rain meant floods, and more. Many talked about the old times fondly, but they are also glad that life these days has been better than in those days. One of the houses where the Heritage Centre is has been kept close to what it was in the old days, sans the smell :) A good starting point before you walk along the streets to Chinatown. You get a better feel and connection, and a sense of imagination of what life was like.",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:12:06.346638

Amazingly I'd never thought to visit the heritage centre. I'm glad I did. Doing so opened up a whole new perspective on China town and the tough lives led by many of its early inhabitants.

The heritage centre consists delightfully authentic displays complete with piped in sounds and in some cases even scents. The supplied media guide provides an excellent accompaniment that really brings the whole experience to life.

If in Singapore, it really is worth checking out",10-2016,Friends,2020-01-30 10:12:06.708024
