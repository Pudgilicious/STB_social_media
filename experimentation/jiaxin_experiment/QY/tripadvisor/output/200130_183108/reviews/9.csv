Inteeractive and funny shows, see some of the amazing birds closer to you and nature. A must visit whilst in Singapore...
There is a pizza Hut in the park!

Usually takes atleast couple of hours to see the park, take the tram if you are tired or its hot. Don't miss the vultures",01-2020,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:50.972273

The park is open every day of the year and about 20 minutes from Marina Bay. We took a grab (like uber) and it was under $10USD. A favorite area was the Wings of Asia where a person can observe the birds in their natural habitat up close. In the park make sure to see the unusual: Edward’s pheasant, Philippine eagle and the Mindanao bleeding heart. A person of any age could easily spend a day here with bird shows, feeding the birds and wildlife tours.",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:51.193275

If you have time visit the place by walking. There is also Shuttle service available. One of the biggest highlight is the Waterfall...",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:51.785632
,1,9,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Dgoh359,731907625,11-12-2019,4,Lovely way to spend time with children,"Friendly to family with strollers. If you love birds, a place to go with family especially when you have children. The place is educational for the children. There are penguins, emu, stork, vultures, macaws and many more.

If you don wan to walk too much, you can also opt for tram ride. There are different shows too, do refer to the brochure, they are worth stopping over to watch and hear the explanation by the park staff.

With stopping to take pictures and rest stop for the legs, it takes about 2-3 hour slow leisure to complete the visit.

Do have a good pair of walking shoes and bring water bottle with you to stay hydrated. There is no shelter in most of the exhibits so if you come during a rainy season, you may want to bring an umbrella",12-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:51.966280

I feel that one cannot go around the park too happily given the steep slopes. Kids however may love seeing colourful birds. Would take you around 2 hours to have a tour around the park,11-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:52.145082

The park size which is smaller than the Singapore zoo, make it manageable by half a day. The show is a must. The birds was well trained. There is also a water park and playground for kids to play around. The water dispensers are everywhere. The tram was convenient. The parking was ample. It is a good experience for our family",08-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:52.325023

Make sure you go to “Lory Loft” and get some bird food, they will fly to you and land on you. My toddler absolutely loved it. Both shows were good and a great way to spend a few hours.",10-2019,Family,2020-01-30 18:31:52.519793
